              "'Chapter 1 Digital Systems and Binary Numbers 1.1  DIGITAL SYSTEMS       Digital systems have such a prominent role in everyday life that we refer to the present       technological period as the digital age. Digital systems are used in communication, busi-       ness transactions, traffic control, spacecraft guidance, medical treatment, weather mon-       itoring, the Internet, and many other commercial, industrial, and scientific enterprises.       We have digital telephones, digital televisions, digital versatile discs, digital cameras,       handheld devices, and, of course, digital computers. We enjoy music downloaded to our       portable media player (e.g., iPod Touch) and other handheld devices having high\\\\       resolution displays. These devices have graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which enable       them to execute commands that appear to the user to be simple, but which, in fact,       involve precise execution of a sequence of complex internal instructions. Most, if not all,       of these devices have a special\\\\purpose digital computer embedded within them. The       most striking property of the digital computer is its generality. It can follow a sequence       of instructions, called a program, that operates on given data. The user can specify and       change the program or the data according to the specific need. Because of this flexibil-       ity, general\\\\purpose digital computers can perform a variety of information\\\\processing       tasks that range over a wide spectrum of applications.          One characteristic of digital systems is their ability to represent and manipulate dis-       crete elements of information. Any set that is restricted to a finite number of elements       contains discrete information. Examples of discrete sets are the 10 decimal digits, the       26 letters of the alphabet, the 52 playing cards, and the 64 squares of a chessboard. Early       digital computers were used for numeric computations. In this case, the discrete ele-       ments were the digits. From this application, the term digital computer emerged. Dis-       crete elements of information are represented in a digital system by physical quantities                                     1             called signals. Electrical signals such as voltages and currents are the most common.             Electronic devices called transistors predominate in the circuitry that implements these             signals. The signals in most present\\\\day electronic digital systems use just two discrete             values and are therefore said to be binary. A binary digit, called a bit, has two values: 0             and 1. Discrete elements of information are represented with groups of bits called binary             codes. For example, the decimal digits 0 through 9 are represented in a digital system             with a code of four bits (e.g., the number 7 is represented by 0111). How a pattern of             bits is interpreted as a number depends on the code system in which it resides. To make             this distinction, we could write (0111)2 to indicate that the pattern 0111 is to be inter-             preted in a binary system, and (0111)10 to indicate that the reference system is decimal.             Then 01112 = 710, which is not the same as 011110, or one hundred eleven. The subscript             indicating the base for interpreting a pattern of bits will be used only when clarification             is needed. Through various techniques, groups of bits can be made to represent discrete             symbols, not necessarily numbers, which are then used to develop the system in a digital             format. Thus, a digital system is a system that manipulates discrete elements of informa-             tion represented internally in binary form. In todays technology, binary systems are most             practical because, as we will see, they can be implemented with electronic components.                 Discrete quantities of information either emerge from the nature of the data being             processed or may be quantized from a continuous process. On the one hand, a payroll             schedule is an inherently discrete process that contains employee names, social security             numbers, weekly salaries, income taxes, and so on. An employees paycheck is processed             by means of discrete data values such as letters of the alphabet (names), digits (salary),             and special symbols (such as $). On the other hand, a research scientist may observe a             continuous process, but record only specific quantities in tabular form. The scientist is             thus quantizing continuous data, making each number in his or her table a discrete             quantity. In many cases, the quantization of a process can be performed automatically             by an analog\\\\to\\\\digital converter, a device that forms a digital (discrete) representation             of a analog (continuous) quantity.                 The general\\\\purpose digital computer is the best\\\\known example of a digital system.             The major parts of a computer are a memory unit, a central processing unit, and inputC             output units. The memory unit stores programs as well as input, output, and intermedi-             ate data. The central processing unit performs arithmetic and other data\\\\processing             operations as specified by the program. The program and data prepared by a user are             transferred into memory by means of an input device such as a keyboard. An output             device, such as a printer, receives the results of the computations, and the printed results             are presented to the user. A digital computer can accommodate many input and output             devices. One very useful device is a communication unit that provides interaction with             other users through the Internet. A digital computer is a powerful instrument that can             perform not only arithmetic computations, but also logical operations. In addition, it can             be programmed to make decisions based on internal and external conditions.                 There are fundamental reasons that commercial products are made with digital cir-             cuits. Like a digital computer, most digital devices are programmable. By changing the             program in a programmable device, the same underlying hardware can be used for many             different applications, thereby allowing its cost of development to be spread across a             wider customer base. Dramatic cost reductions in digital devices have come about                                                                     Section 1.2 Binary Numbers 3      because of advances in digital integrated circuit technology. As the number of transistors      that can be put on a piece of silicon increases to produce complex functions, the cost per      unit decreases and digital devices can be bought at an increasingly reduced price. Equip-      ment built with digital integrated circuits can perform at a speed of hundreds of millions      of operations per second. Digital systems can be made to operate with extreme reli-      ability by using error\\\\correcting codes. An example of this strategy is the digital versa-      tile disk (DVD), in which digital information representing video, audio, and other data      is recorded without the loss of a single item. Digital information on a DVD is recorded      in such a way that, by examining the code in each digital sample before it is played back,      any error can be automatically identified and corrected.         A digital system is an interconnection of digital modules. To understand the opera-      tion of each digital module, it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of digital circuits      and their logical function. The first seven chapters of this book present the basic tools      of digital design, such as logic gate structures, combinational and sequential circuits, and      programmable logic devices. Chapter 8 introduces digital design at the register transfer      level (RTL) using a modern hardware description language (HDL). Chapter 9 concludes      the text with laboratory exercises using digital circuits.         A major trend in digital design methodology is the use of a HDL to describe and simulate      the functionality of a digital circuit. An HDL resembles a programming language and is      suitable for describing digital circuits in textual form. It is used to simulate a digital system      to verify its operation before hardware is built. It is also used in conjunction with logic syn-      thesis tools to automate the design process. Because it is important that students become      familiar with an HDL\\\\based design methodology, HDL descriptions of digital circuits are      presented throughout the book. While these examples help illustrate the features of an HDL,      they also demonstrate the best practices used by industry to exploit HDLs. Ignorance of      these practices will lead to cute, but worthless, HDL models that may simulate a phenom-      enon, but that cannot be synthesized by design tools, or to models that waste silicon area or      synthesize to hardware that cannot operate correctly.         As previously stated, digital systems manipulate discrete quantities of information      that are represented in binary form. Operands used for calculations may be expressed      in the binary number system. Other discrete elements, including the decimal digits and      characters of the alphabet, are represented in binary codes. Digital circuits, also referred      to as logic circuits, process data by means of binary logic elements (logic gates) using      binary signals. Quantities are stored in binary (two\\\\valued) storage elements (flip\\\\flops).      The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the various binary concepts as a frame of      reference for further study in the succeeding chapters. 1.2  BINARY NUMBERS       A decimal number such as 7,392 represents a quantity equal to 7 thousands, plus 3 hun-       dreds, plus 9 tens, plus 2 units. The thousands, hundreds, etc., are powers of 10 implied       by the position of the coefficients (symbols) in the number. To be more exact, 7,392 is a       shorthand notation for what should be written as                                    7 * 103 + 3 * 102 + 9 * 101 + 2 * 100             However, the convention is to write only the numeric coefficients and, from their posi-             tion, deduce the necessary powers of 10 with powers increasing from right to left. In             general, a number with a decimal point is represented by a series of coefficients:                                                       a5a4a3a2a1a0. a-1a-2a-3             The coefficients aj are any of the 10 digits (0, 1, 2, c , 9), and the subscript value j gives             the place value and, hence, the power of 10 by which the coefficient must be multiplied.             Thus, the preceding decimal number can be expressed as                 105a5 + 104a4 + 103a3 + 102a2 + 101a1 + 100a0 + 10-1a-1 + 10-2a-2 + 10-3a-3             with a3 = 7, a2 = 3, a1 = 9, and a0 = 2.                 The decimal number system is said to be of base, or radix, 10 because it uses 10 digits             and the coefficients are multiplied by powers of 10. The binary system is a different             number system. The coefficients of the binary number system have only two possible             values: 0 and 1. Each coefficient aj is multiplied by a power of the radix, e.g., 2j, and             the results are added to obtain the decimal equivalent of the number. The radix             point (e.g., the decimal point when 10 is the radix) distinguishes positive powers of             10 from negative powers of 10. For example, the decimal equivalent of the binary             number 11010.11 is 26.75, as shown from the multiplication of the coefficients by             powers of 2:                   1 * 24 + 1 * 23 + 0 * 22 + 1 * 21 + 0 * 20 + 1 * 2-1 + 1 * 2-2 = 26.75             There are many different number systems. In general, a number expressed in a base\\\\r             system has coefficients multiplied by powers of r:                     an # r n + an-1 # r n-1 + g + a2 # r 2 + a1 # r + a0 + a-1 # r-1                          + a-2 # r-2 + g + a-m # r-m             The coefficients aj range in value from 0 to r - 1. To distinguish between numbers of             different bases, we enclose the coefficients in parentheses and write a subscript equal to             the base used (except sometimes for decimal numbers, where the content makes it obvi-             ous that the base is decimal). An example of a base\\\\5 number is                      (4021.2)5 = 4 * 53 + 0 * 52 + 2 * 51 + 1 * 50 + 2 * 5-1 = (511.4)10             The coefficient values for base 5 can be only 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The octal number system             is a base\\\\8 system that has eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. An example of an octal number             is 127.4. To determine its equivalent decimal value, we expand the number in a power             series with a base of 8:                              (127.4)8 = 1 * 82 + 2 * 81 + 7 * 80 + 4 * 8-1 = (87.5)10             Note that the digits 8 and 9 cannot appear in an octal number.                 It is customary to borrow the needed r digits for the coefficients from the decimal             system when the base of the number is less than 10. The letters of the alphabet are used             to supplement the 10 decimal digits when the base of the number is greater than 10. For             example, in the hexadecimal (base\\\\16) number system, the first 10 digits are borrowed                                          Section 1.2 Binary Numbers 5 from the decimal system. The letters A, B, C, D, E, and F are used for the digits 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively. An example of a hexadecimal number is           (B65F)16 = 11 * 163 + 6 * 162 + 5 * 161 + 15 * 160 = (46,687)10 The hexadecimal system is used commonly by designers to represent long strings of bits in the addresses, instructions, and data in digital systems. For example, B65F is used to represent 1011011001010000.    As noted before, the digits in a binary number are called bits. When a bit is equal to 0, it does not contribute to the sum during the conversion. Therefore, the conversion from binary to decimal can be obtained by adding only the numbers with powers of two corresponding to the bits that are equal to 1. For example,                               (110101)2 = 32 + 16 + 4 + 1 = (53)10    There are four 1s in the binary number. The corresponding decimal number is the sum of the four powers of two. Zero and the first 24 numbers obtained from 2 to the power of n are listed in Table 1.1. In computer work, 210 is referred to as K (kilo), 220 as M (mega), 230 as G (giga), and 240 as T (tera).Thus, 4K = 212 = 4,096 and 16M = 224 = 16,777,216. Computer capacity is usually given in bytes. A byte is equal to eight bits and can accom- modate (i.e., represent the code of) one keyboard character. A computer hard disk with four gigabytes of storage has a capacity of 4G = 232 bytes (approximately 4 billion bytes). A terabyte is 1024 gigabytes, approximately 1 trillion bytes.    Arithmetic operations with numbers in base r follow the same rules as for decimal numbers. When a base other than the familiar base 10 is used, one must be careful to use only the r\\\\allowable digits. Examples of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two binary numbers are as follows: augend:             101101  minuend:       101101  multiplicand:      1011 addend:           + 100111  subtrahend:  - 100111  multiplier:      * 101 sum:              1010100   difference:                                            000110                     1011                                                                     0000                                          partial product:          1011                                                   product:         110111 Table 1.1 Powers of Two n        2n       n         2n           n         2n 0              1  8         256          16        65,536 1              2  9         512          17        131,072 2              4  10        1,024 (1K)   18        262,144 3              8  11        2,048        19        524,288 4        16       12        4,096 (4K)   20        1,048,576 (1M) 5        32       13        8,192        21        2,097,152 6        64       14        16,384       22        4,194,304 7  128            15        32,768       23        8,388,608                 The sum of two binary numbers is calculated by the same rules as in decimal, except             that the digits of the sum in any significant position can be only 0 or 1. Any carry             obtained in a given significant position is used by the pair of digits one significant posi-             tion higher. Subtraction is slightly more complicated. The rules are still the same as in             decimal, except that the borrow in a given significant position adds 2 to a minuend digit.             (A borrow in the decimal system adds 10 to a minuend digit.) Multiplication is simple:             The multiplier digits are always 1 or 0; therefore, the partial products are equal either             to a shifted (left) copy of the multiplicand or to 0. 1.3  NUMBER\\\\BASE CONVERSIONS       Representations of a number in a different radix are said to be equivalent if they have       the same decimal representation. For example, (0011)8 and (1001)2 are equivalentboth       have decimal value 9. The conversion of a number in base r to decimal is done by       expanding the number in a power series and adding all the terms as shown previously.       We now present a general procedure for the reverse operation of converting a decimal       number to a number in base r. If the number includes a radix point, it is necessary to       separate the number into an integer part and a fraction part, since each part must be       converted differently. The conversion of a decimal integer to a number in base r is done       by dividing the number and all successive quotients by r and accumulating the remain-       ders. This procedure is best illustrated by example. EXAMPLE 1.1        Convert decimal 41 to binary. First, 41 is divided by 2 to give an integer quotient of 20        and a remainder of 12. Then the quotient is again divided by 2 to give a new quotient and        remainder. The process is continued until the integer quotient becomes 0. The coefficients        of the desired binary number are obtained from the remainders as follows:               Integer     Remainder                                  Coefficient              Quotient                                    1                                   a0 = 1      41>2 =  20        +           2                                   a1 = 0                                                                        a2 = 0      20>2 =  10        +        0                                      a3 = 1                                 0                                      a4 = 0      10>2 =  5         +                                               a5 = 1                                    1      5>2 =   2         +           2      2>2 =   1         +        0      1>2 =   0         +           1                                    2      Therefore, the answer is (41)10 = (a5a4a3a2a1a0)2 = (101001)2.                             Section 1.3 Number\\\\Base Conversions 7 The arithmetic process can be manipulated more conveniently as follows:               Integer       Remainder               41               20            1               10            0               5             0               2             1               1             0               0             1 101001 = answer Conversion from decimal integers to any base\\\\r system is similar to this example, except that division is done by r instead of 2.                                                                                                                EXAMPLE 1.2 Convert decimal 153 to octal. The required base r is 8. First, 153 is divided by 8 to give an integer quotient of 19 and a remainder of 1. Then 19 is divided by 8 to give an integer quotient of 2 and a remainder of 3. Finally, 2 is divided by 8 to give a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 2. This process can be conveniently manipulated as follows:                        153                        19      1                        2       3                        0       2 = (231)8    The conversion of a decimal fraction to binary is accomplished by a method similar to that used for integers. However, multiplication is used instead of division, and integers instead of remainders are accumulated. Again, the method is best explained by example.                                                                                                                EXAMPLE 1.3 Convert (0.6875)10 to binary. First, 0.6875 is multiplied by 2 to give an integer and a fraction. Then the new fraction is multiplied by 2 to give a new integer and a new fraction. The process is continued until the fraction becomes 0 or until the number of digits has sufficient accuracy. The coefficients of the binary number are obtained from the integers as follows:                   Integer              Fraction  Coefficient                                         0.3750     a-1 = 1 0.6875 * 2 =           1    +           0.7500     a-2 = 0 0.3750 * 2 =                            0.5000     a-3 = 1 0.7500 * 2 =           0    +           0.0000     a-4 = 1 0.5000 * 2 =                        1    +                        1    +             Therefore, the answer is (0.6875)10 = (0. a-1 a-2 a-3 a-4)2 = (0.1011)2.                 To convert a decimal fraction to a number expressed in base r, a similar procedure is             used. However, multiplication is by r instead of 2, and the coefficients found from the             integers may range in value from 0 to r - 1 instead of 0 and 1.                                                                                                                                 EXAMPLE 1.4             Convert (0.513)10 to octal.                                                          0.513 * 8 = 4.104                                                          0.104 * 8 = 0.832                                                          0.832 * 8 = 6.656                                                          0.656 * 8 = 5.248                                                          0.248 * 8 = 1.984                                                          0.984 * 8 = 7.872             The answer, to seven significant figures, is obtained from the integer part of the products:                                                   (0.513)10 = (0.406517 c )8                 The conversion of decimal numbers with both integer and fraction parts is done by             converting the integer and the fraction separately and then combining the two answers.             Using the results of Examples 1.1 and 1.3, we obtain                                                  (41.6875)10 = (101001.1011)2                 From Examples 1.2 and 1.4, we have                                                   (153.513)10 = (231.406517)8                                                                                                                             1.4  OCTAL AND HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS      The conversion from and to binary, octal, and hexadecimal plays an important role in digi-      tal computers, because shorter patterns of hex characters are easier to recognize than long      patterns of 1s and 0s. Since 23 = 8 and 24 = 16, each octal digit corresponds to three      binary digits and each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary digits. The first 16 num-      bers in the decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems are listed in Table 1.2.         The conversion from binary to octal is easily accomplished by partitioning the binary      number into groups of three digits each, starting from the binary point and proceeding      to the left and to the right. The corresponding octal digit is then assigned to each group.      The following example illustrates the procedure:      (10 110 001 101 011 # 111 100 000 110)2 = (26153.7406)8      26 1 5 3  740 6                    Section 1.4 Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers 9      Table 1.2      Numbers with Different Bases       Decimal       Binary              Octal      Hexadecimal      (base 10)     (base 2)           (base 8)       (base 16)      00            0000                   00                0                                           01                1      01            0001                   02                2                                           03                3      02            0010                   04                4                                           05                5      03            0011                   06                6                                           07                7      04            0100                   10                8                                           11                9      05            0101                   12               A                                           13               B      06            0110                   14               C                                           15               D      07            0111                   16               E                                           17               F      08            1000      09            1001      10            1010      11            1011      12            1100      13            1101      14            1110      15            1111 Conversion from binary to hexadecimal is similar, except that the binary number is divided into groups of four digits:      (10 1100 0110 1011 # 1111 0010)2 = (2C6B.F2)16      2C         6  B                  F         2 The corresponding hexadecimal (or octal) digit for each group of binary digits is easily remembered from the values listed in Table 1.2.    Conversion from octal or hexadecimal to binary is done by reversing the preceding procedure. Each octal digit is converted to its three\\\\digit binary equivalent. Similarly, each hexadecimal digit is converted to its four\\\\digit binary equivalent. The procedure is illustrated in the following examples:      (673.124)8 = (110 111 011 # 001 010 100)2                    673                          124 and          (306.D)16 = (0011 0000 0110 # 1101)2                          3         0     6         D    Binary numbers are difficult to work with because they require three or four times as many digits as their decimal equivalents. For example, the binary number 111111111111 is equivalent to decimal 4095. However, digital computers use binary numbers, and it is sometimes necessary for the human operator or user to communicate directly with the             machine by means of such numbers. One scheme that retains the binary system in the             computer, but reduces the number of digits the human must consider, utilizes the rela-             tionship between the binary number system and the octal or hexadecimal system. By this             method, the human thinks in terms of octal or hexadecimal numbers and performs the             required conversion by inspection when direct communication with the machine is nec-             essary. Thus, the binary number 111111111111 has 12 digits and is expressed in octal as             7777 (4 digits) or in hexadecimal as FFF (3 digits). During communication between             people (about binary numbers in the computer), the octal or hexadecimal representa-             tion is more desirable because it can be expressed more compactly with a third or a             quarter of the number of digits required for the equivalent binary number. Thus, most             computer manuals use either octal or hexadecimal numbers to specify binary quantities.             The choice between them is arbitrary, although hexadecimal tends to win out, since it             can represent a byte with two digits. 1.5  COMPLEMENTS OF NUMBERS       Complements are used in digital computers to simplify the subtraction operation and for       logical manipulation. Simplifying operations leads to simpler, less expensive circuits to       implement the operations. There are two types of complements for each base\\\\r system:       the radix complement and the diminished radix complement. The first is referred to as       the rs complement and the second as the (r - 1)>s complement. When the value of the       base r is substituted in the name, the two types are referred to as the 2s complement and       1s complement for binary numbers and the 10s complement and 9s complement for       decimal numbers. Diminished Radix Complement             Given a number N in base r having n digits, the (r - 1)>s complement of N, i.e., its             diminished radix complement, is defined as (r n - 1) - N. For decimal numbers, r = 10             and r - 1 = 9, so the 9s complement of N is (10 n - 1) - N. In this case, 10 n represents             a number that consists of a single 1 followed by n 0s. 10n - 1 is a number represented             by n 9s. For example, if n = 4, we have 104 = 10,000 and 104 - 1 = 9999. It follows             that the 9s complement of a decimal number is obtained by subtracting each digit from 9.             Here are some numerical examples:                             The 9>s complement of 546700 is 999999 - 546700 = 453299.                             The 9>s complement of 012398 is 999999 - 012398 = 987601.                 For binary numbers, r = 2 and r - 1 = 1, so the 1s complement of N is (2n - 1) - N.             Again, 2n is represented by a binary number that consists of a 1 followed by n 0s. 2n - 1             is a binary number represented by n 1s. For example, if n = 4, we have 24 = (10000)2             and 24 - 1 = (1111)2. Thus, the 1s complement of a binary number is obtained by             subtracting each digit from 1. However, when subtracting binary digits from 1, we can                                                            Section 1.5 Complements of Numbers 11             have either 1 - 0 = 1 or 1 - 1 = 0, which causes the bit to change from 0 to 1 or from             1 to 0, respectively. Therefore, the 1s complement of a binary number is formed by             changing 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s. The following are some numerical examples:                                         The 1s complement of 1011000 is 0100111.                                         The 1s complement of 0101101 is 1010010.                 The (r - 1)>s complement of octal or hexadecimal numbers is obtained by subtracting             each digit from 7 or F (decimal 15), respectively. Radix Complement             The rs complement of an n\\\\digit number N in base r is defined as r n - N for N  0 and             as 0 for N = 0. Comparing with the (r - 1)>s complement, we note that the rs complement             is obtained by adding 1 to the (r - 1)>s complement, since r n - N = [(r n - 1) - N] + 1.             Thus, the 10s complement of decimal 2389 is 7610 + 1 = 7611 and is obtained by adding             1 to the 9s complement value.The 2s complement of binary 101100 is 010011 + 1 = 010100             and is obtained by adding 1 to the 1s\\\\complement value.                 Since 10 is a number represented by a 1 followed by n 0s, 10n - N, which is the 10s             complement of N, can be formed also by leaving all least significant 0s unchanged,             subtracting the first nonzero least significant digit from 10, and subtracting all higher             significant digits from 9. Thus,                                           the 10s complement of 012398 is 987602             and                                           the 10s complement of 246700 is 753300             The 10s complement of the first number is obtained by subtracting 8 from 10 in the least             significant position and subtracting all other digits from 9. The 10s complement of the             second number is obtained by leaving the two least significant 0s unchanged, subtract-             ing 7 from 10, and subtracting the other three digits from 9.                 Similarly, the 2s complement can be formed by leaving all least significant 0s and             the first 1 unchanged and replacing 1s with 0s and 0s with 1s in all other higher sig-             nificant digits. For example,                                          the 2s complement of 1101100 is 0010100             and                                          the 2s complement of 0110111 is 1001001             The 2s complement of the first number is obtained by leaving the two least significant             0s and the first 1 unchanged and then replacing 1s with 0s and 0s with 1s in the other             four most significant digits. The 2s complement of the second number is obtained by             leaving the least significant 1 unchanged and complementing all other digits.                 In the previous definitions, it was assumed that the numbers did not have a radix point.             If the original number N contains a radix point, the point should be removed temporarily             in order to form the rs or (r - 1)>s complement. The radix point is then restored to the             complemented number in the same relative position. It is also worth mentioning that the             complement of the complement restores the number to its original value. To see this             relationship, note that the rs complement of N is r n - N, so that the complement of the             complement is r n - (r n - N) = N and is equal to the original number. Subtraction with Complements             The direct method of subtraction taught in elementary schools uses the borrow concept.             In this method, we borrow a 1 from a higher significant position when the minuend digit             is smaller than the subtrahend digit. The method works well when people perform sub-             traction with paper and pencil. However, when subtraction is implemented with digital             hardware, the method is less efficient than the method that uses complements.                 The subtraction of two n\\\\digit unsigned numbers M - N in base r can be done as             follows:                 1. Add the minuend M to the rs complement of the subtrahend N. Mathematically,                     M + (r n - N) = M - N + r n.                 2. If M  N, the sum will produce an end carry r n, which can be discarded; what is                     left is the result M - N.                 3. If M 6 N, the sum does not produce an end carry and is equal to r n - (N - M),                    which is the rs complement of (N - M). To obtain the answer in a familiar form,                    take the rs complement of the sum and place a negative sign in front.             The following examples illustrate the procedure:     EXAMPLE 1.5             Using 10s complement, subtract 72532 - 3250.                                                                          M = 72532                                                10>s complement of N = + 96750                                                                       Sum = 169282                                                Discard end carry 105 = - 100000                                                                   Answer = 69282             Note that M has five digits and N has only four digits. Both numbers must have the same             number of digits, so we write N as 03250. Taking the 10s complement of N produces a             9 in the most significant position. The occurrence of the end carry signifies that M  N             and that the result is therefore positive.                                                                                                                                                                                   Section 1.5 Complements of Numbers 13 EXAMPLE 1.6        Using 10s complement, subtract 3250 - 72532.                                                                    M = 03250                                          10>s complement of N = + 27468                                                                 Sum = 30718        There is no end carry.Therefore, the answer is -(10>s complement of 30718) = -69282.            Note that since 3250 6 72532, the result is negative. Because we are dealing with        unsigned numbers, there is really no way to get an unsigned result for this case. When        subtracting with complements, we recognize the negative answer from the absence        of the end carry and the complemented result. When working with paper and pencil,        we can change the answer to a signed negative number in order to put it in a famil-        iar form.            Subtraction with complements is done with binary numbers in a similar manner, using        the procedure outlined previously.

Therefore, the answer is Y - X = -(2>s complement of 1101111) = - 0010001.                                                                                                                Subtraction of unsigned numbers can also be done by means of the (r - 1)>s com- plement. Remember that the (r - 1)>s complement is one less than the rs comple- ment. Because of this, the result of adding the minuend to the complement of the subtrahend produces a sum that is one less than the correct difference when an end carry occurs. Removing the end carry and adding 1 to the sum is referred to as an end\\\\around carry. EXAMPLE 1.8      Repeat Example 1.7, but this time using 1s complement.      (a) X - Y = 1010100 - 1000011                                     X = 1010100              1>s complement of Y = + 0111100                                     Sum = 10010000              End@around carry = +                              1              Answer: X - Y = 0010001      (b) Y - X = 1000011 - 1010100                                       Y = 1000011              1>s complement of X = + 0101011                                   Sum = 1101110      There is no end carry.Therefore, the answer is Y - X = -(1>s complement of 1101110) =      - 0010001.                                                                                                                          Note that the negative result is obtained by taking the 1s complement of the sum, since      this is the type of complement used. The procedure with end\\\\around carry is also appli-      cable to subtracting unsigned decimal numbers with 9s complement. 1.6  SIGNED BINARY NUMBERS       Positive integers (including zero) can be represented as unsigned numbers. However, to       represent negative integers, we need a notation for negative values. In ordinary arith-       metic, a negative number is indicated by a minus sign and a positive number by a plus       sign. Because of hardware limitations, computers must represent everything with binary       digits. It is customary to represent the sign with a bit placed in the leftmost position of       the number. The convention is to make the sign bit 0 for positive and 1 for negative.          It is important to realize that both signed and unsigned binary numbers consist of a       string of bits when represented in a computer. The user determines whether the number       is signed or unsigned. If the binary number is signed, then the leftmost bit represents the       sign and the rest of the bits represent the number. If the binary number is assumed to       be unsigned, then the leftmost bit is the most significant bit of the number. For example,       the string of bits 01001 can be considered as 9 (unsigned binary) or as + 9 (signed binary)       because the leftmost bit is 0. The string of bits 11001 represents the binary equivalent of       25 when considered as an unsigned number and the binary equivalent of -9 when con-       sidered as a signed number. This is because the 1 that is in the leftmost position designates       a negative and the other four bits represent binary 9. Usually, there is no confusion in       interpreting the bits if the type of representation for the number is known in advance. Section 1.6 Signed Binary Numbers 15    The representation of the signed numbers in the last example is referred to as the signed\\\\magnitude convention. In this notation, the number consists of a magnitude and a symbol ( + or - ) or a bit (0 or 1) indicating the sign. This is the representation of signed numbers used in ordinary arithmetic. When arithmetic operations are implemented in a computer, it is more convenient to use a different system, referred to as the signed\\\\ complement system, for representing negative numbers. In this system, a negative num- ber is indicated by its complement. Whereas the signed\\\\magnitude system negates a number by changing its sign, the signed\\\\complement system negates a number by taking its complement. Since positive numbers always start with 0 (plus) in the leftmost posi- tion, the complement will always start with a 1, indicating a negative number. The signed\\\\complement system can use either the 1s or the 2s complement, but the 2s complement is the most common.    As an example, consider the number 9, represented in binary with eight bits. +9 is represented with a sign bit of 0 in the leftmost position, followed by the binary equiva- lent of 9, which gives 00001001. Note that all eight bits must have a value; therefore, 0s are inserted following the sign bit up to the first 1. Although there is only one way to represent +9, there are three different ways to represent -9 with eight bits: signed\\\\magnitude representation:         10001001 signed\\\\1s\\\\complement representation:  11110110 signed\\\\2s\\\\complement representation:  11110111 In signed\\\\magnitude, - 9 is obtained from + 9 by changing only the sign bit in the leftmost position from 0 to 1. In signed\\\\1s-complement, -9 is obtained by complementing all the bits of +9, including the sign bit. The signed\\\\2s\\\\complement representation of -9 is obtained by taking the 2s complement of the positive number, including the sign bit.    Table 1.3 lists all possible four\\\\bit signed binary numbers in the three representations. The equivalent decimal number is also shown for reference. Note that the positive num- bers in all three representations are identical and have 0 in the leftmost position. The signed\\\\2s\\\\complement system has only one representation for 0, which is always posi- tive. The other two systems have either a positive 0 or a negative 0, something not encountered in ordinary arithmetic. Note that all negative numbers have a 1 in the leftmost bit position; that is the way we distinguish them from the positive numbers. With four bits, we can represent 16 binary numbers. In the signed\\\\magnitude and the 1s\\\\complement representations, there are eight positive numbers and eight negative numbers, including two zeros. In the 2s\\\\complement representation, there are eight positive numbers, including one zero, and eight negative numbers.    The signed\\\\magnitude system is used in ordinary arithmetic, but is awkward when employed in computer arithmetic because of the separate handling of the sign and the magnitude. Therefore, the signed\\\\complement system is normally used. The 1s com- plement imposes some difficulties and is seldom used for arithmetic operations. It is useful as a logical operation, since the change of 1 to 0 or 0 to 1 is equivalent to a logical complement operation, as will be shown in the next chapter. The discussion of signed binary arithmetic that follows deals exclusively with the signed\\\\2s\\\\complement Table 1.3 Signed Binary Numbers Decimal    Signed\\\\2s      Signed\\\\1s           Signed          Complement        Complement            Magnitude +7       0111                    0111                 0111                                  0110                 0110 +6       0110                    0101                 0101                                  0100                 0100 +5       0101                    0011                 0011                                  0010                 0010 +4       0100                    0001                 0001                                  0000                 0000 +3       0011                    1111                 1000                                  1110                 1001 +2       0010                    1101                 1010                                  1100                 1011 +1       0001                    1011                 1100                                  1010                 1101 +0       0000                    1001                 1110                                  1000                 1111 -0                                                                            -1       1111 -2       1110 -3       1101 -4       1100 -5       1011 -6       1010 -7       1001 -8       1000             representation of negative numbers. The same procedures can be applied to the             signed\\\\1s\\\\complement system by including the end\\\\around carry as is done with             unsigned numbers. Arithmetic Addition             The addition of two numbers in the signed\\\\magnitude system follows the rules of             ordinary arithmetic. If the signs are the same, we add the two magnitudes and give             the sum the common sign. If the signs are different, we subtract the smaller magni-             tude from the larger and give the difference the sign of the larger magnitude. For             example, ( +25) + ( -37) = -(37 - 25) = -12 is done by subtracting the smaller mag-             nitude, 25, from the larger magnitude, 37, and appending the sign of 37 to the result.             This is a process that requires a comparison of the signs and magnitudes and then per-             forming either addition or subtraction. The same procedure applies to binary numbers             in signed\\\\magnitude representation. In contrast, the rule for adding numbers in the             signed\\\\complement system does not require a comparison or subtraction, but only             addition. The procedure is very simple and can be stated as follows for binary numbers:                 The addition of two signed binary numbers with negative numbers represented in             signed\\\\2s\\\\complement form is obtained from the addition of the two numbers, includ-             ing their sign bits. A carry out of the sign\\\\bit position is discarded.               Section 1.6 Signed Binary Numbers 17 Numerical examples for addition follow: + 6 00000110                             - 6 11111010 +13 00001101                             +13 00001101 +19 00010011                             + 7 00000111 + 6 00000110                             - 6 11111010 -13 11110011                             -13 11110011 - 7 11111001                             -19 11101101 Note that negative numbers must be initially in 2s\\\\complement form and that if the sum obtained after the addition is negative, it is in 2s\\\\complement form. For example, -7 is represented as 11111001, which is the 2s complement of +7.    In each of the four cases, the operation performed is addition with the sign bit included. Any carry out of the sign\\\\bit position is discarded, and negative results are automatically in 2s\\\\complement form.    In order to obtain a correct answer, we must ensure that the result has a sufficient number of bits to accommodate the sum. If we start with two n\\\\bit numbers and the sum occupies n + 1 bits, we say that an overflow occurs.When one performs the addition with paper and pencil, an overflow is not a problem, because we are not limited by the width of the page. We just add another 0 to a positive number or another 1 to a negative number in the most significant position to extend the number to n + 1 bits and then perform the addition. Overflow is a problem in computers because the number of bits that hold a number is finite, and a result that exceeds the finite value by 1 cannot be accommodated.    The complement form of representing negative numbers is unfamiliar to those used to the signed\\\\magnitude system. To determine the value of a negative number in signed\\\\2s complement, it is necessary to convert the number to a positive number to place it in a more familiar form. For example, the signed binary number 11111001 is negative because the leftmost bit is 1. Its 2s complement is 00000111, which is the binary equivalent of +7. We therefore recognize the original negative number to be equal to -7. Arithmetic Subtraction             Subtraction of two signed binary numbers when negative numbers are in 2s\\\\complement             form is simple and can be stated as follows:                 Take the 2s complement of the subtrahend (including the sign bit) and add it to the                   minuend (including the sign bit). A carry out of the sign\\\\bit position is discarded.             This procedure is adopted because a subtraction operation can be changed to an addi-             tion operation if the sign of the subtrahend is changed, as is demonstrated by the             following relationship:                                                 ( {A) - (+B) = ( {A) + (-B);                                                ( {A) - (-B) = ( {A) + (+B).             But changing a positive number to a negative number is easily done by taking the 2s             complement of the positive number. The reverse is also true, because the complement             of a negative number in complement form produces the equivalent positive number. To             see this, consider the subtraction ( -6) - ( -13) = +7. In binary with eight bits, this             operation is written as (11111010 - 11110011) . The subtraction is changed to addition             by taking the 2s complement of the subtrahend (-13), giving (+13) . In binary, this is             11111010 + 00001101 = 100000111. Removing the end carry, we obtain the correct             answer: 00000111 ( +7) .                 It is worth noting that binary numbers in the signed\\\\complement system are added             and subtracted by the same basic addition and subtraction rules as unsigned numbers.             Therefore, computers need only one common hardware circuit to handle both types of             arithmetic. This consideration has resulted in the signed\\\\complement system being used             in virtually all arithmetic units of computer systems. The user or programmer must             interpret the results of such addition or subtraction differently, depending on whether             it is assumed that the numbers are signed or unsigned. 1.7  BINARY CODES       Digital systems use signals that have two distinct values and circuit elements that       have two stable states. There is a direct analogy among binary signals, binary circuit       elements, and binary digits. A binary number of n digits, for example, may be repre-       sented by n binary circuit elements, each having an output signal equivalent to 0 or 1.       Digital systems represent and manipulate not only binary numbers, but also many       other discrete elements of information. Any discrete element of information that is       distinct among a group of quantities can be represented with a binary code (i.e., a       pattern of 0s and 1s). The codes must be in binary because, in todays technology,       only circuits that represent and manipulate patterns of 0s and 1s can be manufac-       tured economically for use in computers. However, it must be realized that binary       codes merely change the symbols, not the meaning of the elements of information       that they represent. If we inspect the bits of a computer at random, we will find that       most of the time they represent some type of coded information rather than binary       numbers.          An n\\\\bit binary code is a group of n bits that assumes up to 2n distinct combinations       of 1s and 0s, with each combination representing one element of the set that is being       coded. A set of four elements can be coded with two bits, with each element assigned       one of the following bit combinations: 00, 01, 10, 11. A set of eight elements requires a       three\\\\bit code and a set of 16 elements requires a four\\\\bit code. The bit combination of       an n\\\\bit code is determined from the count in binary from 0 to 2n - 1. Each element       must be assigned a unique binary bit combination, and no two elements can have the       same value; otherwise, the code assignment will be ambiguous.          Although the minimum number of bits required to code 2n distinct quantities is n,       there is no maximum number of bits that may be used for a binary code. For example,       the 10 decimal digits can be coded with 10 bits, and each decimal digit can be assigned       a bit combination of nine 0s and a 1. In this particular binary code, the digit 6 is assigned       the bit combination 0001000000.                                                                               Section 1.7 Binary Codes 19 Binary-Coded Decimal Code             Although the binary number system is the most natural system for a computer because             it is readily represented in todays electronic technology, most people are more accus-             tomed to the decimal system. One way to resolve this difference is to convert decimal             numbers to binary, perform all arithmetic calculations in binary, and then convert the             binary results back to decimal. This method requires that we store decimal numbers in             the computer so that they can be converted to binary. Since the computer can accept             only binary values, we must represent the decimal digits by means of a code that contains             1s and 0s. It is also possible to perform the arithmetic operations directly on decimal             numbers when they are stored in the computer in coded form.                 A binary code will have some unassigned bit combinations if the number of elements             in the set is not a multiple power of 2. The 10 decimal digits form such a set. A binary             code that distinguishes among 10 elements must contain at least four bits, but 6 out of             the 16 possible combinations remain unassigned. Different binary codes can be obtained             by arranging four bits into 10 distinct combinations. The code most commonly used for             the decimal digits is the straight binary assignment listed in Table 1.4. This scheme is             called binary\\\\coded decimal and is commonly referred to as BCD. Other decimal codes             are possible and a few of them are presented later in this section.                 Table 1.4 gives the four\\\\bit code for one decimal digit. A number with k decimal             digits will require 4k bits in BCD. Decimal 396 is represented in BCD with 12 bits as             0011 1001 0110, with each group of 4 bits representing one decimal digit. A decimal             number in BCD is the same as its equivalent binary number only when the number is             between 0 and 9. A BCD number greater than 10 looks different from its equivalent             binary number, even though both contain 1s and 0s. Moreover, the binary combina-             tions 1010 through 1111 are not used and have no meaning in BCD. Consider decimal             185 and its corresponding value in BCD and binary:                                       (185)10 = (0001 1000 0101)BCD = (10111001)2 Table 1.4 Binary\\\\Coded Decimal (BCD) Decimal  BCD Symbol   Digit 0        0000 1        0001 2        0010 3        0011 4        0100 5        0101 6        0110 7        0111 8        1000 9        1001             The BCD value has 12 bits to encode the characters of the decimal value, but the equiv-             alent binary number needs only 8 bits. It is obvious that the representation of a BCD             number needs more bits than its equivalent binary value. However, there is an advantage             in the use of decimal numbers, because computer input and output data are generated             by people who use the decimal system.                 It is important to realize that BCD numbers are decimal numbers and not binary             numbers, although they use bits in their representation. The only difference between a             decimal number and BCD is that decimals are written with the symbols 0, 1, 2, c , 9             and BCD numbers use the binary code 0000, 0001, 0010, c , 1001. The decimal value             is exactly the same. Decimal 10 is represented in BCD with eight bits as 0001 0000 and             decimal 15 as 0001 0101. The corresponding binary values are 1010 and 1111 and have             only four bits. BCD Addition             Consider the addition of two decimal digits in BCD, together with a possible carry             from a previous less significant pair of digits. Since each digit does not exceed 9, the             sum cannot be greater than 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, with the 1 being a previous carry. Sup-             pose we add the BCD digits as if they were binary numbers. Then the binary sum will             produce a result in the range from 0 to 19. In binary, this range will be from 0000 to             10011, but in BCD, it is from 0000 to 1 1001, with the first (i.e., leftmost) 1 being a             carry and the next four bits being the BCD sum. When the binary sum is equal to or             less than 1001 (without a carry), the corresponding BCD digit is correct. However,             when the binary sum is greater than or equal to 1010, the result is an invalid BCD             digit. The addition of 6 = (0110)2 to the binary sum converts it to the correct digit and             also produces a carry as required. This is because a carry in the most significant bit             position of the binary sum and a decimal carry differ by 16 - 10 = 6. Consider the             following three BCD additions: 4 0100 4 0100 8 1000 +5 +0101 +8 +1000 +9 1001 9 1001 12 1100 17 10001 + 0110  + 0110 10010   10111 In each case, the two BCD digits are added as if they were two binary numbers. If the binary sum is greater than or equal to 1010, we add 0110 to obtain the correct BCD sum and a carry. In the first example, the sum is equal to 9 and is the correct BCD sum. In the second example, the binary sum produces an invalid BCD digit.The addition of 0110 produces the correct BCD sum, 0010 (i.e., the number 2), and a carry. In the third example, the binary sum produces a carry. This condition occurs when the sum is greater than or equal to 16. Although the other four bits are less than 1001, the binary sum requires a correction because of the carry. Adding 0110, we obtain the required BCD sum 0111 (i.e., the number 7) and a BCD carry.                      Section 1.7 Binary Codes 21    The addition of two n\\\\digit unsigned BCD numbers follows the same procedure. Consider the addition of 184 + 576 = 760 in BCD: BCD               1        1  0100    184               0001    1000    0110  + 576 Binary sum  + 0101    0111    1010 Add 6         0111   10000    0110    760 BCD sum               0110    0000               0111    0110 The first, least significant pair of BCD digits produces a BCD digit sum of 0000 and a carry for the next pair of digits. The second pair of BCD digits plus a previous carry produces a digit sum of 0110 and a carry for the next pair of digits. The third pair of digits plus a carry produces a binary sum of 0111 and does not require a correction. Decimal Arithmetic             The representation of signed decimal numbers in BCD is similar to the representation             of signed numbers in binary. We can use either the familiar signed\\\\magnitude system or             the signed\\\\complement system. The sign of a decimal number is usually represented             with four bits to conform to the four\\\\bit code of the decimal digits. It is customary to             designate a plus with four 0s and a minus with the BCD equivalent of 9, which is 1001.                 The signed\\\\magnitude system is seldom used in computers. The signed\\\\complement             system can be either the 9s or the 10s complement, but the 10s complement is the one             most often used. To obtain the 10s complement of a BCD number, we first take the 9s             complement and then add 1 to the least significant digit. The 9s complement is calcu-             lated from the subtraction of each digit from 9.                 The procedures developed for the signed\\\\2s\\\\complement system in the previous             section also apply to the signed\\\\10s\\\\complement system for decimal numbers. Addition             is done by summing all digits, including the sign digit, and discarding the end carry. This             operation assumes that all negative numbers are in 10s\\\\complement form. Consider the             addition ( +375) + ( -240) = +135, done in the signed\\\\complement system:                                                                  0 375                                                                +9 760                                                                  0 135             The 9 in the leftmost position of the second number represents a minus, and 9760 is             the 10s complement of 0240. The two numbers are added and the end carry is dis-             carded to obtain + 135. Of course, the decimal numbers inside the computer, including             the sign digits, must be in BCD. The addition is done with BCD digits as described             previously.                 The subtraction of decimal numbers, either unsigned or in the signed\\\\10s\\\\complement             system, is the same as in the binary case: Take the 10s complement of the subtrahend and             add it to the minuend. Many computers have special hardware to perform arithmetic             calculations directly with decimal numbers in BCD. The user of the computer can specify             programmed instructions to perform the arithmetic operation with decimal numbers             directly, without having to convert them to binary. Other Decimal Codes             Binary codes for decimal digits require a minimum of four bits per digit. Many different             codes can be formulated by arranging four bits into 10 distinct combinations. BCD and             three other representative codes are shown in Table 1.5. Each code uses only 10 out of             a possible 16 bit combinations that can be arranged with four bits. The other six unused             combinations have no meaning and should be avoided.                 BCD and the 2421 code are examples of weighted codes. In a weighted code, each bit             position is assigned a weighting factor in such a way that each digit can be evaluated by             adding the weights of all the 1s in the coded combination. The BCD code has weights             of 8, 4, 2, and 1, which correspond to the power\\\\of\\\\two values of each bit. The bit assign-             ment 0110, for example, is interpreted by the weights to represent decimal 6 because             8 * 0 + 4 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 1 * 0 = 6. The bit combination 1101, when weighted by the             respective digits 2421, gives the decimal equivalent of 2 * 1 + 4 * 1 + 2 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 7.             Note that some digits can be coded in two possible ways in the 2421 code. For instance,             decimal 4 can be assigned to bit combination 0100 or 1010, since both combinations add             up to a total weight of 4.

However, it is necessary to add 6 to the result if it is greater than 9. BCD             adders require significantly more hardware and no longer have a speed advantage of             conventional binary adders [5].                 The 2421 and the excess\\\\3 codes are examples of self\\\\complementing codes. Such             codes have the property that the 9s complement of a decimal number is obtained             directly by changing 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s (i.e., by complementing each bit in the pat-             tern). For example, decimal 395 is represented in the excess\\\\3 code as 0110 1100 1000.             The 9s complement of 604 is represented as 1001 0011 0111, which is obtained simply             by complementing each bit of the code (as with the 1s complement of binary numbers).                 The excess\\\\3 code has been used in some older computers because of its self\\\\             complementing property. Excess\\\\3 is an unweighted code in which each coded com-             bination is obtained from the corresponding binary value plus 3. Note that the BCD             code is not self\\\\complementing.                 The 8, 4, -2, -1 code is an example of assigning both positive and negative weights             to a decimal code. In this case, the bit combination 0110 is interpreted as decimal 2 and             is calculated from 8 * 0 + 4 * 1 + ( -2) * 1 + ( -1) * 0 = 2. Gray Code             The output data of many physical systems are quantities that are continuous. These             data must be converted into digital form before they are applied to a digital system.             Continuous or analog information is converted into digital form by means of an ana-             log\\\\to\\\\digital converter. It is sometimes convenient to use the Gray code shown in             Table 1.6 to represent digital data that have been converted from analog data. The             advantage of the Gray code over the straight binary number sequence is that only             one bit in the code group changes in going from one number to the next. For example,             in going from 7 to 8, the Gray code changes from 0100 to 1100. Only the first bit             changes, from 0 to 1; the other three bits remain the same. By contrast, with binary             numbers the change from 7 to 8 will be from 0111 to 1000, which causes all four bits             to change values.                 The Gray code is used in applications in which the normal sequence of binary numbers             generated by the hardware may produce an error or ambiguity during the transition from             one number to the next. If binary numbers are used, a change, for example, from 0111 to             1000 may produce an intermediate erroneous number 1001 if the value of the rightmost             bit takes longer to change than do the values of the other three bits. This could have seri-             ous consequences for the machine using the information. The Gray code eliminates this             problem, since only one bit changes its value during any transition between two numbers.                 A typical application of the Gray code is the representation of analog data by a con-             tinuous change in the angular position of a shaft. The shaft is partitioned into segments,             and each segment is assigned a number. If adjacent segments are made to correspond             with the Gray\\\\code sequence, ambiguity is eliminated between the angle of the shaft             and the value encoded by the sensor.

For instance,             consider a high\\\\tech company with thousands of employees. To represent the names             and other pertinent information, it is necessary to formulate a binary code for the let-             ters of the alphabet. In addition, the same binary code must represent numerals and             special characters (such as $). An alphanumeric character set is a set of elements that             includes the 10 decimal digits, the 26 letters of the alphabet, and a number of special             characters. Such a set contains between 36 and 64 elements if only capital letters are             included, or between 64 and 128 elements if both uppercase and lowercase letters are             included. In the first case, we need a binary code of six bits, and in the second, we need             a binary code of seven bits.                 The standard binary code for the alphanumeric characters is the American Standard             Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), which uses seven bits to code 128 charac-             ters, as shown in Table 1.7. The seven bits of the code are designated by b1 through b7,             with b7 the most significant bit. The letter A, for example, is represented in ASCII as             1000001 (column 100, row 0001). The ASCII code also contains 94 graphic characters             that can be printed and 34 nonprinting characters used for various control functions.             The graphic characters consist of the 26 uppercase letters (A through Z), the 26 lower-             case letters (a through z), the 10 numerals (0 through 9), and 32 special printable char-             acters, such as %, *, and $.

They are listed again below the table with their functional names. The control characters are used for routing data and arranging the printed text into a prescribed format. There are three types of control characters: format effectors, information separators, and communication\\\\control characters. Format effectors are characters that control the layout of printing. They include the familiar word processor and typewriter controls such as backspace (BS), horizontal tabu- lation (HT), and carriage return (CR). Information separators are used to separate the data into divisions such as paragraphs and pages. They include characters such as record separator (RS) and file separator (FS). The communication\\\\control characters are useful during the transmission of text between remote devices so that it can be distinguished from other messages using the same communication channel before it and after it. Examples of communication\\\\control characters are STX (start of text) and ETX (end of text), which are used to frame a text message transmitted through a communication channel.    ASCII is a seven\\\\bit code, but most computers manipulate an eight\\\\bit quantity as a single unit called a byte. Therefore, ASCII characters most often are stored one per byte. The extra bit is sometimes used for other purposes, depending on the appli- cation. For example, some printers recognize eight\\\\bit ASCII characters with the most significant bit set to 0. An additional 128 eight\\\\bit characters with the most significant bit set to 1 are used for other symbols, such as the Greek alphabet or italic type font. Error\\\\Detecting Code             To detect errors in data communication and processing, an eighth bit is sometimes added             to the ASCII character to indicate its parity. A parity bit is an extra bit included with a             message to make the total number of 1s either even or odd. Consider the following two             characters and their even and odd parity: ASCII A = 1000001  With even parity              With odd parity ASCII T = 1010100      01000001                     11000001                        11010100                      01010100 In each case, we insert an extra bit in the leftmost position of the code to produce an even number of 1s in the character for even parity or an odd number of 1s in the char- acter for odd parity. In general, one or the other parity is adopted, with even parity being more common.    The parity bit is helpful in detecting errors during the transmission of information from one location to another. This function is handled by generating an even parity bit at the sending end for each character. The eight\\\\bit characters that include parity bits are transmitted to their destination. The parity of each character is then checked at the receiving end. If the parity of the received character is not even, then at least one bit has changed value during the transmission. This method detects one, three, or any odd com- bination of errors in each character that is transmitted. An even combination of errors, however, goes undetected, and additional error detection codes may be needed to take care of that possibility.    What is done after an error is detected depends on the particular application. One possibility is to request retransmission of the message on the assumption that the error was random and will not occur again. Thus, if the receiver detects a parity error, it sends                                                 Section 1.8 Binary Storage and Registers 27      back the ASCII NAK (negative acknowledge) control character consisting of an even\\\\      parity eight bits 10010101. If no error is detected, the receiver sends back an ACK      (acknowledge) control character, namely, 00000110.The sending end will respond to an      NAK by transmitting the message again until the correct parity is received. If, after a      number of attempts, the transmission is still in error, a message can be sent to the oper-      ator to check for malfunctions in the transmission path. 1.8  BINARY STORAGE AND REGISTERS       The binary information in a digital computer must have a physical existence in some       medium for storing individual bits. A binary cell is a device that possesses two stable       states and is capable of storing one bit (0 or 1) of information. The input to the cell       receives excitation signals that set it to one of the two states. The output of the cell is       a physical quantity that distinguishes between the two states. The information stored       in a cell is 1 when the cell is in one stable state and 0 when the cell is in the other stable       state. Registers             A register is a group of binary cells. A register with n cells can store any discrete quantity             of information that contains n bits. The state of a register is an n\\\\tuple of 1s and 0s, with             each bit designating the state of one cell in the register. The content of a register is a             function of the interpretation given to the information stored in it. Consider, for example,             a 16\\\\bit register with the following binary content:                                                         1100001111001001             A register with 16 cells can be in one of 216 possible states. If one assumes that the con-             tent of the register represents a binary integer, then the register can store any binary             number from 0 to 216 - 1. For the particular example shown, the content of the register             is the binary equivalent of the decimal number 50,121. If one assumes instead that the             register stores alphanumeric characters of an eight\\\\bit code, then the content of the             register is any two meaningful characters. For the ASCII code with an even parity placed             in the eighth most significant bit position, the register contains the two characters C (the             leftmost eight bits) and I (the rightmost eight bits). If, however, one interprets the con-             tent of the register to be four decimal digits represented by a four\\\\bit code, then the             content of the register is a four\\\\digit decimal number. In the excess\\\\3 code, the register             holds the decimal number 9,096. The content of the register is meaningless in BCD,             because the bit combination 1100 is not assigned to any decimal digit. From this exam-             ple, it is clear that a register can store discrete elements of information and that the same             bit configuration may be interpreted differently for different types of data depending             on the application. Register Transfer             A digital system is characterized by its registers and the components that perform data             processing. In digital systems, a register transfer operation is a basic operation that con-             sists of a transfer of binary information from one set of registers into another set of             registers. The transfer may be direct, from one register to another, or may pass through             data\\\\processing circuits to perform an operation. Figure 1.1 illustrates the transfer of infor-             mation among registers and demonstrates pictorially the transfer of binary information             from a keyboard into a register in the memory unit. The input unit is assumed to have a             keyboard, a control circuit, and an input register. Each time a key is struck, the control             circuit enters an equivalent eight\\\\bit alphanumeric character code into the input register.             We shall assume that the code used is the ASCII code with an odd\\\\parity bit. The informa-             tion from the input register is transferred into the eight least significant cells of a processor             register. After every transfer, the input register is cleared to enable the control to insert a             new eight\\\\bit code when the keyboard is struck again. Each eight\\\\bit character transferred             to the processor register is preceded by a shift of the previous character to the next eight             cells on its left. When a transfer of four characters is completed, the processor register is             full, and its contents are transferred into a memory register.

To process discrete quantities of information in binary form, a computer must be provided with devices that hold the data to be processed and with circuit elements that manipulate individual bits of information. The device most commonly used for holding data is a register. Binary variables are manipulated by means of digital logic circuits. Figure 1.2 illustrates the process of adding two 10\\\\bit binary numbers. The memory unit, which normally consists of millions of registers, is shown with only three of its registers. The part of the processor unit shown consists of three registersR1, R2, and R3 together with digital logic circuits that manipulate the bits of R1 and R2 and transfer into R3 a binary number equal to their arithmetic sum. Memory registers store information and are incapable of processing the two operands. However, the information stored in memory can be transferred to processor registers, and the results obtained in processor registers can be transferred back into a memory register for storage until needed again. The diagram shows the contents of two operands transferred from two memory registers            MEMORY UNIT                                                  Sum               0000000000 Operand 1            0011100001 Operand 2            0001000010            0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 R1              Digital logic                                           0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 R3               circuits for            binary addition                                              0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 R2                                           PROCESSOR UNIT FIGURE 1.2 Example of binary information processing             into R1 and R2.

The last two examples demonstrated the information\\\\flow capabilities of a digital             system in a simple manner. The registers of the system are the basic elements for storing             and holding the binary information. Digital logic circuits process the binary information             stored in the registers. Digital logic circuits and registers are covered in Chapters 2             through 6. The memory unit is explained in Chapter 7. The description of register oper-             ations at the register transfer level and the design of digital systems are covered in             Chapter 8. 1.9  BINARY LOGIC       Binary logic deals with variables that take on two discrete values and with operations       that assume logical meaning. The two values the variables assume may be called by dif-       ferent names (true and false, yes and no, etc.), but for our purpose, it is convenient to       think in terms of bits and assign the values 1 and 0. The binary logic introduced in this       section is equivalent to an algebra called Boolean algebra. The formal presentation of       Boolean algebra is covered in more detail in Chapter 2. The purpose of this section is       to introduce Boolean algebra in a heuristic manner and relate it to digital logic circuits       and binary signals. Definition of Binary Logic             Binary logic consists of binary variables and a set of logical operations. The variables are             designated by letters of the alphabet, such as A, B, C, x, y, z, etc., with each variable hav-             ing two and only two distinct possible values: 1 and 0. There are three basic logical oper-             ations: AND, OR, and NOT. Each operation produces a binary result, denoted by z.                 1. AND: This operation is represented by a dot or by the absence of an operator. For              example, x # y = z or xy = z is read x AND y is equal to z. The logical operation                     AND is interpreted to mean that z = 1 if and only if x = 1 and y = 1; otherwise                     z = 0. (Remember that x, y, and z are binary variables and can be equal either to              1 or 0, and nothing else.) The result of the operation x # y is z.                 2. OR: This operation is represented by a plus sign. For example, x + y = z is read                     x OR y is equal to z, meaning that z = 1 if x = 1 or if y = 1 or if both x = 1                     and y = 1. If both x = 0 and y = 0, then z = 0.                 3. NOT: This operation is represented by a prime (sometimes by an overbar). For                     example, x = z (or x = z) is read not x is equal to z, meaning that z is what x                     is not. In other words, if x = 1, then z = 0, but if x = 0, then z = 1. The NOT                     operation is also referred to as the complement operation, since it changes a 1 to                     0 and a 0 to 1, i.e., the result of complementing 1 is 0, and vice versa.                 Binary logic resembles binary arithmetic, and the operations AND and OR have             similarities to multiplication and addition, respectively. In fact, the symbols used for Table 1.8                           Section 1.9 Binary Logic 31 Truth Tables of Logical Operations                                             NOT     AND        OR                          x x                                            0 1 x y x#y  x y x+y                           1 0 00 0     00 0 01 0     01 1 10 0     10 1 11 1     11 1             AND and OR are the same as those used for multiplication and addition. However,             binary logic should not be confused with binary arithmetic. One should realize that an             arithmetic variable designates a number that may consist of many digits. A logic vari-             able is always either 1 or 0. For example, in binary arithmetic, we have 1 + 1 = 10 (read             one plus one is equal to 2), whereas in binary logic, we have 1 + 1 = 1 (read one             OR one is equal to one).                 For each combination of the values of x and y, there is a value of z specified by the             definition of the logical operation. Definitions of logical operations may be listed in a             compact form called truth tables. A truth table is a table of all possible combinations of             the variables, showing the relation between the values that the variables may take and             the result of the operation. The truth tables for the operations AND and OR with vari-             ables x and y are obtained by listing all possible values that the variables may have when             combined in pairs. For each combination, the result of the operation is then listed in a             separate row. The truth tables for AND, OR, and NOT are given in Table 1.8. These             tables clearly demonstrate the definition of the operations. Logic Gates             Logic gates are electronic circuits that operate on one or more input signals to pro-             duce an output signal. Electrical signals such as voltages or currents exist as analog             signals having values over a given continuous range, say, 0 to 3 V, but in a digital             system these voltages are interpreted to be either of two recognizable values, 0 or 1.             Voltage\\\\operated logic circuits respond to two separate voltage levels that represent a             binary variable equal to logic 1 or logic 0. For example, a particular digital system may             define logic 0 as a signal equal to 0 V and logic 1 as a signal equal to 3 V. In practice,             each voltage level has an acceptable range, as shown in Fig. 1.3. The input terminals of             digital circuits accept binary signals within the allowable range and respond at the             output terminals with binary signals that fall within the specified range. The intermedi-             ate region between the allowed regions is crossed only during a state transition. Any             desired information for computing or control can be operated on by passing binary             signals through various combinations of logic gates, with each signal representing a             particular binary variable. When the physical signal is in a particular range it is inter-             preted to be either a 0 or a 1.

The gates are blocks of hardware that produce the equivalent of logic\\\\1 or logic\\\\0 output signals if input logic requirements are satisfied. The input signals x and y in the AND and OR gates may exist in one of four possible states: 00, 10, 11, or 01. These input signals are shown in Fig. 1.5 together with the corresponding output signal for each gate. The timing diagrams illustrate the idealized response of each gate to the four input signal combinations. The horizontal axis of the timing diagram represents the time, and the vertical axis shows the signal as it changes between the two possible voltage levels. In reality, the transitions between logic values occur quickly, but not instantaneously. The low level represents logic 0, the high level logic 1. The AND gate responds with a logic 1 output signal when both input signals are logic 1. The OR gate responds with a logic 1 output signal if any input signal is logic 1. The NOT gate is commonly referred to as an inverter. The reason for this name is apparent from the signal response in the timing diagram, which shows that the output signal inverts the logic sense of the input signal.

The output produces logic 0 if any input is logic 0. The four\\\\input OR gate responds with logic 1 if any input is logic 1; its output becomes logic 0 only when all inputs are logic 0.

Finding simpler and       cheaper, but equivalent, realizations of a circuit can reap huge payoffs in reducing the       overall cost of the design. Mathematical methods that simplify circuits rely primarily on       Boolean algebra. Therefore, this chapter provides a basic vocabulary and a brief founda-       tion in Boolean algebra that will enable you to optimize simple circuits and to under-       stand the purpose of algorithms used by software tools to optimize complex circuits       involving millions of logic gates. 2.2  BASIC DEFINITIONS 38    Boolean algebra, like any other deductive mathematical system, may be defined with a       set of elements, a set of operators, and a number of unproved axioms or postulates. A set       of elements is any collection of objects, usually having a common property. If S is a set,       and x and y are certain objects, then the notation x H S means that x is a member of the       set S and y x S means that y is not an element of S. A set with a denumerable number       of elements is specified by braces: A = {1, 2, 3, 4} indicates that the elements of set A       are the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. A binary operator defined on a set S of elements is a rule       that assigns, to each pair of elements from S, a unique element from S. As an example,       consider the relation a * b = c. We say that * is a binary operator if it specifies a rule       for finding c from the pair (a, b) and also if a, b, c H S. However, * is not a binary operator       if a, b H S, and if c x S.                                                             Section 2.2 Basic Definitions 39    The postulates of a mathematical system form the basic assumptions from which it is possible to deduce the rules, theorems, and properties of the system. The most com- mon postulates used to formulate various algebraic structures are as follows:    1. Closure. A set S is closed with respect to a binary operator if, for every pair of        elements of S, the binary operator specifies a rule for obtaining a unique element        of S. For example, the set of natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, 4, c} is closed with        respect to the binary operator + by the rules of arithmetic addition, since, for any        a, b H N, there is a unique c H N such that a + b = c. The set of natural numbers        is not closed with respect to the binary operator - by the rules of arithmetic        subtraction, because 2 - 3 = -1 and 2, 3 H N, but ( -1) x N.    2. Associative law. A binary operator * on a set S is said to be associative whenever                               (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) for all x, y, z, H S    3. Commutative law. A binary operator * on a set S is said to be commutative when-        ever                                       x * y = y * x for all x, y H S    4. Identity element. A set S is said to have an identity element with respect to a binary        operation * on S if there exists an element e H S with the property that                                   e * x = x * e = x for every x H S        Example: The element 0 is an identity element with respect to the binary operator        + on the set of integers I = { c, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, c}, since                                   x + 0 = 0 + x = x for any x H I        The set of natural numbers, N, has no identity element, since 0 is excluded from the set.    5. Inverse. A set S having the identity element e with respect to a binary operator *        is said to have an inverse whenever, for every x H S, there exists an element y H S        such that                                                   x *y = e        Example: In the set of integers, I, and the operator +, with e = 0, the inverse of        an element a is ( -a), since a + ( -a) = 0.   6. Distributive law. If * and # are two binary operators on a set S, * is said to be dis-     tributive over # whenever                           x * (y # z) = (x * y) # (x * z) A field is an example of an algebraic structure. A field is a set of elements, together with two binary operators, each having properties 1 through 5 and both operators combining to give property 6. The set of real numbers, together with the binary operators + and # ,             forms the field of real numbers. The field of real numbers is the basis for arithmetic and             ordinary algebra. The operators and postulates have the following meanings:                     The binary operator + defines addition.                    The additive identity is 0.                    The additive inverse defines subtraction.              The binary operator # defines multiplication.                     The multiplicative identity is 1.              For a  0, the multiplicative inverse of a = 1>a defines division (i.e., a # 1>a = 1).              The only distributive law applicable is that of # over +:                                    a # (b + c) = (a # b) + (a # c) 2.3  AXIOMATIC DEFINITION      OF BOOLEAN ALGEBRA       In 1854, George Boole developed an algebraic system now called Boolean algebra. In       1938, Claude E. Shannon introduced a two\\\\valued Boolean algebra called switching       algebra that represented the properties of bistable electrical switching circuits. For the       formal definition of Boolean algebra, we shall employ the postulates formulated by       E. V. Huntington in 1904.          Boolean algebra is an algebraic structure defined by a set of elements, B, together      with two binary operators, + and # , provided that the following (Huntington) postulates       are satisfied:          1. (a) The structure is closed with respect to the operator +.           (b) The structure is closed with respect to the operator # .          2. (a) The element 0 is an identity element with respect to +; that is, x + 0 =                   0 + x = x.           (b) The element 1 is an identity element with respect to # ; that is, x # 1 = 1 # x = x.          3. (a) The structure is commutative with respect to +; that is, x + y = y + x .           (b) The structure is commutative with respect to # ; that is, x # y = y # x.         4. (a) The operator # is distributive over +; that is, x # (y + z) = (x # y) + (x # z).           (b) The operator + is distributive over # ; that is, x + (y # z) = (x + y) # (x + z).          5. For every element x H B, there exists an element x H B (called the complement of x)           such that (a) x + x = 1 and (b) x # x = 0.          6. There exist at least two elements x, y H B such that x  y.          Comparing Boolean algebra with arithmetic and ordinary algebra (the field of real       numbers), we note the following differences:          1. Huntington postulates do not include the associative law. However, this law holds for              Boolean algebra and can be derived (for both operators) from the other postulates.         2. The distributive law of + over # (i.e., x + (y # z) = (x + y) # (x + z)) is valid for              Boolean algebra, but not for ordinary algebra.                           Section 2.3 Axiomatic Definition of Boolean Algebra 41    3. Boolean algebra does not have additive or multiplicative inverses; therefore, there        are no subtraction or division operations.    4. Postulate 5 defines an operator called the complement that is not available in        ordinary algebra.    5. Ordinary algebra deals with the real numbers, which constitute an infinite set of        elements. Boolean algebra deals with the as yet undefined set of elements, B, but        in the two\\\\valued Boolean algebra defined next (and of interest in our subse-        quent use of that algebra), B is defined as a set with only two elements, 0 and 1.    Boolean algebra resembles ordinary algebra in some respects. The choice of the symbols + and # is intentional, to facilitate Boolean algebraic manipulations by persons already familiar with ordinary algebra. Although one can use some knowledge from ordinary algebra to deal with Boolean algebra, the beginner must be careful not to substitute the rules of ordinary algebra where they are not applicable.    It is important to distinguish between the elements of the set of an algebraic structure and the variables of an algebraic system. For example, the elements of the field of real numbers are numbers, whereas variables such as a, b, c, etc., used in ordinary algebra, are symbols that stand for real numbers. Similarly, in Boolean algebra, one defines the elements of the set B, and variables such as x, y, and z are merely symbols that represent the elements. At this point, it is important to realize that, in order to have a Boolean algebra, one must show that    1. the elements of the set B,    2. the rules of operation for the two binary operators, and    3. the set of elements, B, together with the two operators, satisfy the six Huntington        postulates.    One can formulate many Boolean algebras, depending on the choice of elements of B and the rules of operation. In our subsequent work, we deal only with a two\\\\valued Boolean algebra (i.e., a Boolean algebra with only two elements). Two\\\\valued Boolean algebra has applications in set theory (the algebra of classes) and in propositional logic. Our interest here is in the application of Boolean algebra to gate\\\\type circuits commonly used in digital devices and computers. Two\\\\Valued Boolean Algebra             A two\\\\valued Boolean algebra is defined on a set of two elements, B = {0, 1}, with rules         for the two binary operators + and # as shown in the following operator tables (the rule             for the complement operator is for verification of postulate 5): x y  x#y  x y  xy    x x 0 0  0    0 0     0  0 1           0 1     1  1 0 0 1  0    1 0     1           1 1     1 1 0  0 1 1  1    These rules are exactly the same as the AND, OR, and NOT operations, respectively, defined in Table 1.8. We must now show that the Huntington postulates are valid for the set B = {0, 1} and the two binary operators + and # . 1. That the structure is closed with respect to the two operators is obvious from the    tables, since the result of each operation is either 1 or 0 and 1, 0 H B. 2. From the tables, we see that (a) 0 + 0 = 0  0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1; (b) 1 # 1 = 1   1 # 0 = 0 # 1 = 0. This establishes the two identity elements, 0 for + and 1 for # , as defined by postulate 2. 3. The commutative laws are obvious from the symmetry of the binary operator tables. 4. (a) The distributive law x # (y + z) = (x # y) + (x # z) can be shown to hold from    the operator tables by forming a truth table of all possible values of x, y, and z. For   each combination, we derive x # (y + z) and show that the value is the same as the   value of (x # y) + (x # z): xy z           y  z  x # (y z)                x # y x # z (x # y) (x # z) 00 0             0         0                  0 0  0 00 1             1         0 01 0             1         0                  0 0  0 01 1             1         0 10 0             0         0                  0 0  0 10 1             1         1 11 0             1         1                  0 0  0 11 1             1         1                                               0 0  0                                               0 1  1                                               1 0  1                                               1 1  1 (b) The distributive law of + over # can be shown to hold by means of a truth table similar to the one in part (a).    5. From the complement table, it is easily shown that        (a) x + x  = 1, since 0 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1 and 1 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1.     (b) x # x = 0, since 0 # 0 = 0 # 1 = 0 and 1 # 1 = 1 # 0 = 0.        Thus, postulate 1 is verified.    6. Postulate 6 is satisfied because the two\\\\valued Boolean algebra has two elements,        1 and 0, with 1  0.    We have just established a two\\\\valued Boolean algebra having a set of two elements, 1 and 0, two binary operators with rules equivalent to the AND and OR operations, and a complement operator equivalent to the NOT operator. Thus, Boolean algebra has been defined in a formal mathematical manner and has been shown to be equivalent to the binary logic presented heuristically in Section 1.9. The heuristic presentation is helpful in understanding the application of Boolean algebra to gate\\\\type circuits. The formal             Section 2.4 Basic Theorems and Properties of Boolean Algebra 43 presentation is necessary for developing the theorems and properties of the algebraic system. The two\\\\valued Boolean algebra defined in this section is also called switching algebra by engineers. To emphasize the similarities between two\\\\valued Boolean alge- bra and other binary systems, that algebra was called binary logic in Section 1.9. From here on, we shall drop the adjective two\\\\valued from Boolean algebra in subsequent discussions. 2.4 BASIC THEOREMS AND PROPERTIES          OF BOOLEAN ALGEBRA Duality             In Section 2.3, the Huntington postulates were listed in pairs and designated by part             (a) and part (b). One part may be obtained from the other if the binary operators and             the identity elements are interchanged. This important property of Boolean algebra is             called the duality principle and states that every algebraic expression deducible from             the postulates of Boolean algebra remains valid if the operators and identity elements             are interchanged. In a two\\\\valued Boolean algebra, the identity elements and the ele-             ments of the set B are the same: 1 and 0. The duality principle has many applications. If             the dual of an algebraic expression is desired, we simply interchange OR and AND             operators and replace 1s by 0s and 0s by 1s. Basic Theorems             Table 2.1 lists six theorems of Boolean algebra and four of its postulates. The notation             is simplified by omitting the binary operator whenever doing so does not lead to             confusion. The theorems and postulates listed are the most basic relationships in Boolean Table 2.1 Postulates and Theorems of Boolean Algebra Postulate 2             (a)   x +0=x                   (b)  x#1 = x Postulate 5             (a)   x + x = 1                (b)  x # x = 0 Theorem 1               (a)   x +x =x                  (b)  x#x = x Theorem 2               (a)   x +1=1                   (b)  x#0 = 0 Theorem 3, involution         (x ) = x Postulate 3, commutative (a)  x +y=y+x                 (b)  xy = yx Theorem 4, associative  (a) x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z  (b)  x (yz) = (x y)z Postulate 4, distributive (a) x (y + z) = x y + x z    (b) x + yz = (x + y)(x + z) Theorem 5, DeMorgan     (a)   (x + y) = x y            (b)  (x y) = x  + y Theorem 6, absorption   (a)   x + xy = x               (b) x (x + y) = x algebra. The theorems, like the postulates, are listed in pairs; each relation is the dual of the one paired with it. The postulates are basic axioms of the algebraic structure and need no proof. The theorems must be proven from the postulates. Proofs of the theorems with one variable are presented next. At the right is listed the number of the postulate which justifies that particular step of the proof. THEOREM 1(a): x + x = x.             Statement                         Justification x + x = (x + x) # 1                           postulate 2(b)                                                            5(a)         = (x + x)(x + x)                                   4(b)         = x + xx                                           5(b)         =x+0                                               2(a)         =x THEOREM 1(b): x # x = x.       Statement                               Justification x # x = xx + 0                                postulate 2(a)                                                            5(b)       = xx + xx                                            4(a)       = x(x + x)                                           5(a)                                                            2(b)     = x#1       =x    Note that theorem 1(b) is the dual of theorem 1(a) and that each step of the proof in part (b) is the dual of its counterpart in part (a). Any dual theorem can be similarly derived from the proof of its corresponding theorem. THEOREM 2(a): x + 1 = 1.            Statement                          Justification                                               postulate 2(b) x + 1 = 1 # (x + 1)                                                            5(a)         = (x + x)(x + 1)                                   4(b)                                                            2(b)      = x + x # 1                                           5(a)         = x + x         =1 THEOREM 2(b): x # 0 = 0 by duality. THEOREM 3: (x) = x. From postulate 5, we have x + x = 1 and x # x = 0, which together define the complement of x. The complement of x is x and is also (x). Section 2.4 Basic Theorems and Properties of Boolean Algebra 45 Therefore, since the complement is unique, we have (x) = x. The theorems involv- ing two or three variables may be proven algebraically from the postulates and the theorems that have already been proven. Take, for example, the absorption theorem: THEOREM 6(a): x + xy = x.         Statement                          Justification                                            postulate 2(b) x + xy = x # 1 + xy                                                         4(a)           = x(1 + y)                                    3(a)           = x(y + 1)                                    2(a)                                                         2(b)       = x#1           =x THEOREM 6(b): x(x + y) = x by duality.    The theorems of Boolean algebra can be proven by means of truth tables. In truth tables, both sides of the relation are checked to see whether they yield identical results for all possible combinations of the variables involved. The following truth table verifies the first absorption theorem: x y                                     xy x  xy 0 0 0 1                                     0  0 1 0 1 1                                     0  0                                         0  1                                         1  1    The algebraic proofs of the associative law and DeMorgans theorem are long and will not be shown here. However, their validity is easily shown with truth tables. For example, the truth table for the first DeMorgans theorem, (x + y) = xy, is as follows: x y x  y (x  y)                            x y xy                                            11 1 00 0  1                                    10 0                                            01 0 01 1  0                                    00 0 10 1  0 11 1  0 Operator Precedence             The operator precedence for evaluating Boolean expressions is (1) parentheses,             (2) NOT, (3) AND, and (4) OR. In other words, expressions inside parentheses must be             evaluated before all other operations. The next operation that holds precedence is the             complement, and then follows the AND and, finally, the OR. As an example, consider             the truth table for one of DeMorgans theorems. The left side of the expression is             (x + y). Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first and the             result then complemented. The right side of the expression is xy, so the complement             of x and the complement of y are both evaluated first and the result is then ANDed.             Note that in ordinary arithmetic, the same precedence holds (except for the comple-             ment) when multiplication and addition are replaced by AND and OR, respectively. 2.5  BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS       Boolean algebra is an algebra that deals with binary variables and logic operations. A       Boolean function described by an algebraic expression consists of binary variables, the       constants 0 and 1, and the logic operation symbols. For a given value of the binary variables,       the function can be equal to either 1 or 0. As an example, consider the Boolean function                                                      F1 = x + yz       The function F1 is equal to 1 if x is equal to 1 or if both y and z are equal to 1. F1 is equal       to 0 otherwise. The complement operation dictates that when y = 1, y = 0. Therefore,       F1 = 1 if x = 1 or if y = 0 and z = 1. A Boolean function expresses the logical rela-       tionship between binary variables and is evaluated by determining the binary value of       the expression for all possible values of the variables.          A Boolean function can be represented in a truth table. The number of rows in the       truth table is 2n, where n is the number of variables in the function. The binary combina-       tions for the truth table are obtained from the binary numbers by counting from 0       through 2n - 1. Table 2.2 shows the truth table for the function F1. There are eight pos-       sible binary combinations for assigning bits to the three variables x, y, and z. The column       labeled F1 contains either 0 or 1 for each of these combinations. The table shows that       the function is equal to 1 when x = 1 or when yz = 01 and is equal to 0 otherwise.          A Boolean function can be transformed from an algebraic expression into a circuit       diagram composed of logic gates connected in a particular structure. The logic\\\\circuit       diagram (also called a schematic) for F1 is shown in Fig. 2.1.There is an inverter for input       y to generate its complement. There is an AND gate for the term yz and an OR gate      Table 2.2      Truth Tables for F1 and F2      x y z    F1                 F2      0  0  0  0                  0      0  0  1  1                  1      0  1  0  0                  0      0  1  1  0                  1      1  0  0  1                  1      1  0  1  1                  1      1  1  0  1                  0      1  1  1  1                  0                                                           Section 2.5 Boolean Functions 47                       x                                                                                                                    F1                       y                       z     FIGURE 2.1     Gate implementation of F1  x  yz that combines x with yz. In logic\\\\circuit diagrams, the variables of the function are taken as the inputs of the circuit and the binary variable F1 is taken as the output of the circuit. The schematic expresses the relationship between the output of the circuit and its inputs. Rather than listing each combination of inputs and outputs, it indicates how to compute the logic value of each output from the logic values of the inputs.    There is only one way that a Boolean function can be represented in a truth table. However, when the function is in algebraic form, it can be expressed in a variety of ways, all of which have equivalent logic. The particular expression used to represent the function will dictate the interconnection of gates in the logic\\\\circuit diagram. Conversely, the inter- connection of gates will dictate the logic expression. Here is a key fact that motivates our use of Boolean algebra: By manipulating a Boolean expression according to the rules of Boolean algebra, it is sometimes possible to obtain a simpler expression for the same function and thus reduce the number of gates in the circuit and the number of inputs to the gate. Designers are motivated to reduce the complexity and number of gates because their effort can significantly reduce the cost of a circuit. Consider, for example, the fol- lowing Boolean function:                                        F2 = xyz + xyz + xy A schematic of an implementation of this function with logic gates is shown in Fig. 2.2(a). Input variables x and y are complemented with inverters to obtain x and y. The three terms in the expression are implemented with three AND gates. The OR gate forms the logical OR of the three terms. The truth table for F2 is listed in Table 2.2. The function is equal to 1 when xyz = 001 or 011 or when xy = 10 (irre- spective of the value of z) and is equal to 0 otherwise. This set of conditions produces four 1s and four 0s for F2.    Now consider the possible simplification of the function by applying some of the identities of Boolean algebra:                 F2 = xyz + xyz + xy = xz(y + y) + xy = xz + xy The function is reduced to only two terms and can be implemented with gates as shown in Fig. 2.2(b). It is obvious that the circuit in (b) is simpler than the one in (a), yet both implement the same function. By means of a truth table, it is possible to verify that the two expressions are equivalent. The simplified expression is equal to 1 when xz = 01 or when xy = 10. This produces the same four 1s in the truth table. Since both expressions                             x                             y z                                             F2                                                                   (a) F2  xyz  xyz  xy                             x                             y                                                                                                                                             F2                             z                                                                         (b) F2  xy  xz                   FIGURE 2.2                   Implementation of Boolean function F2 with gates             produce the same truth table, they are equivalent. Therefore, the two circuits have the             same outputs for all possible binary combinations of inputs of the three variables. Each             circuit implements the same identical function, but the one with fewer gates and fewer             inputs to gates is preferable because it requires fewer wires and components. In general,             there are many equivalent representations of a logic function. Finding the most eco-             nomic representation of the logic is an important design task. Algebraic Manipulation             When a Boolean expression is implemented with logic gates, each term requires a gate             and each variable within the term designates an input to the gate. We define a literal to             be a single variable within a term, in complemented or uncomplemented form. The             function of Fig. 2.2(a) has three terms and eight literals, and the one in Fig. 2.2(b) has             two terms and four literals. By reducing the number of terms, the number of literals, or             both in a Boolean expression, it is often possible to obtain a simpler circuit. The manip-             ulation of Boolean algebra consists mostly of reducing an expression for the purpose of             obtaining a simpler circuit. Functions of up to five variables can be simplified by the             map method described in the next chapter. For complex Boolean functions and many                                                           Section 2.5 Boolean Functions 49 different outputs, designers of digital circuits use computer minimization programs that are capable of producing optimal circuits with millions of logic gates. The concepts intro- duced in this chapter provide the framework for those tools. The only manual method available is a cut\\\\and\\\\try procedure employing the basic relations and other manipulation techniques that become familiar with use, but remain, nevertheless, subject to human error. The examples that follow illustrate the algebraic manipulation of Boolean algebra to acquaint the reader with this important design task.

Functions 1 and 2 are the dual of each other and use dual expressions in correspond-        ing steps. An easier way to simplify function 3 is by means of postulate 4(b) from        Table 2.1: (x + y)(x + y) = x + yy = x. The fourth function illustrates the fact that        an increase in the number of literals sometimes leads to a simpler final expression.        Function 5 is not minimized directly, but can be derived from the dual of the steps used        to derive function 4. Functions 4 and 5 are together known as the consensus theorem. Complement of a Function The complement of a function F is F and is obtained from an interchange of 0s for 1s and 1s for 0s in the value of F. The complement of a function may be derived algebraically through DeMorgans theorems, listed in Table 2.1 for two variables. DeMorgans theo- rems can be extended to three or more variables. The three\\\\variable form of the first DeMorgans theorem is derived as follows, from postulates and theorems listed in Table 2.1: (A + B + C) = (A + x) let B + C = x                           = Ax   by theorem 5(a) (DeMorgan)                           = A(B + C) substitute B + C = x                           = A(BC) by theorem 5(a) (DeMorgan)                           = ABC  by theorem 4(b) (associative)             DeMorgans theorems for any number of variables resemble the two\\\\variable case in             form and can be derived by successive substitutions similar to the method used in the             preceding derivation. These theorems can be generalized as follows:                                   (A + B + C + D + g + F) = ABCD c F                                   (ABCD c F) = A + B + C + D + g + F             The generalized form of DeMorgans theorems states that the complement of a func-             tion is obtained by interchanging AND and OR operators and complementing each             literal.     EXAMPLE 2.2             Find the complement of the functions F1 = xyz + xyz and F2 = x(yz + yz). By             applying DeMorgans theorems as many times as necessary, the complements are             obtained as follows:                       F1= = (xyz + xyz) = (xyz)(xyz) = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)                       F2= = [x(yz + yz)] = x + (yz + yz) = x + (yz)(yz)                                                      = x + (y + z)(y + z)                                                      = x + yz + yz                                                                                                                                             A simpler procedure for deriving the complement of a function is to take the dual of             the function and complement each literal. This method follows from the generalized             forms of DeMorgans theorems. Remember that the dual of a function is obtained from             the interchange of AND and OR operators and 1s and 0s.     EXAMPLE 2.3             Find the complement of the functions F1 and F2 of Example 2.2 by taking their duals             and complementing each literal.                 1. F1 = xyz + xyz.                     The dual of F1 is (x + y + z)(x + y + z).                     Complement each literal: (x + y + z)(x + y + z) = F1=.                 2. F2 = x(yz + yz).                     The dual of F2 is x + (y + z)(y + z).                     Complement each literal: x + (y + z)(y + z) = F2=.                                                                                                                                                                                  Section 2.6 Canonical and Standard Forms 51 2.6 CANONICAL AND STANDARD FORMS Minterms and Maxterms             A binary variable may appear either in its normal form (x) or in its complement form (x).             Now consider two binary variables x and y combined with an AND operation. Since each             variable may appear in either form, there are four possible combinations: xy, xy, xy,             and xy. Each of these four AND terms is called a minterm, or a standard product. In a             similar manner, n variables can be combined to form 2n minterms. The 2n different min-             terms may be determined by a method similar to the one shown in Table 2.3 for three             variables. The binary numbers from 0 to 2n - 1 are listed under the n variables. Each             minterm is obtained from an AND term of the n variables, with each variable being             primed if the corresponding bit of the binary number is a 0 and unprimed if a 1. A symbol             for each minterm is also shown in the table and is of the form mj, where the subscript j             denotes the decimal equivalent of the binary number of the minterm designated.                 In a similar fashion, n variables forming an OR term, with each variable being primed             or unprimed, provide 2n possible combinations, called maxterms, or standard sums. The             eight maxterms for three variables, together with their symbolic designations, are listed             in Table 2.3. Any 2n maxterms for n variables may be determined similarly. It is impor-             tant to note that (1) each maxterm is obtained from an OR term of the n variables, with             each variable being unprimed if the corresponding bit is a 0 and primed if a 1, and (2)             each maxterm is the complement of its corresponding minterm and vice versa.                 A Boolean function can be expressed algebraically from a given truth table by form-             ing a minterm for each combination of the variables that produces a 1 in the function             and then taking the OR of all those terms. For example, the function f1 in Table 2.4 is             determined by expressing the combinations 001, 100, and 111 as xyz, xyz, and xyz,             respectively. Since each one of these minterms results in f1 = 1, we have                                        f1 = xyz + xyz + xyz = m1 + m4 + m7 Table 2.3 Minterms and Maxterms for Three Binary Variables               Minterms                                  Maxterms x  y  z  Term Designation                         Term       Designation 0  0  0  xyz  m0                                  x+y+z           M0 0  0  1  xyz  m1                                  x + y + z       M1 0  1  0  xyz  m2                                  x + y + z       M2 0  1  1  xyz  m3                                  x + y + z       M3 1  0  0  xyz  m4                                  x + y + z       M4 1  0  1  xyz  m5                                  x + y + z       M5 1  1  0  xyz  m6                                  x + y + z       M6 1  1  1  xyz  m7                                  x + y + z       M7 Table 2.4 Functions of Three Variables x  y  z  Function f1                          Function f2 0  0  0                       0                      0                                                      0 0  0  1                       1                      0                                                      1 0  1  0                       0                      0                                                      1 0  1  1                       0                      1                                                      1 1  0  0                       1 1  0  1                       0 1  1  0                       0 1  1  1                       1 Similarly, it may be easily verified that                    f2 = xyz + xyz + xyz + xyz = m3 + m5 + m6 + m7 These examples demonstrate an important property of Boolean algebra: Any Boolean function can be expressed as a sum of minterms (with sum meaning the ORing of terms).    Now consider the complement of a Boolean function. It may be read from the truth table by forming a minterm for each combination that produces a 0 in the function and then ORing those terms. The complement of f1 is read as                             f1= = xyz + xyz + xyz + xyz + xyz If we take the complement of f1=, we obtain the function f1:                   f1 = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z)               = M0 # M2 # M3 # M5 # M6 Similarly, it is possible to read the expression for f2 from the table:                    f2 = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z)                        = M0M1M2M4 These examples demonstrate a second property of Boolean algebra: Any Boolean func- tion can be expressed as a product of maxterms (with product meaning the ANDing of terms). The procedure for obtaining the product of maxterms directly from the truth table is as follows: Form a maxterm for each combination of the variables that produces a 0 in the function, and then form the AND of all those maxterms. Boolean functions expressed as a sum of minterms or product of maxterms are said to be in canonical form. Sum of Minterms             Previously, we stated that, for n binary variables, one can obtain 2n distinct minterms and             that any Boolean function can be expressed as a sum of minterms. The minterms whose             sum defines the Boolean function are those which give the 1s of the function in a                                                 Section 2.6 Canonical and Standard Forms 53        truth table. Since the function can be either 1 or 0 for each minterm, and since there are        2n minterms, one can calculate all the functions that can be formed with n variables to        be 22n. It is sometimes convenient to express a Boolean function in its sum\\\\of\\\\minterms        form. If the function is not in this form, it can be made so by first expanding the expres-        sion into a sum of AND terms. Each term is then inspected to see if it contains all the        variables. If it misses one or more variables, it is ANDed with an expression such as        x + x, where x is one of the missing variables.The next example clarifies this procedure. EXAMPLE 2.4        Express the Boolean function F = A + BC as a sum of minterms. The function has        three variables: A, B, and C. The first term A is missing two variables; therefore,                                            A = A(B + B) = AB + AB        This function is still missing one variable, so                                          A = AB(C + C) + AB(C + C)                                             = ABC + ABC + ABC + ABC        The second term BC is missing one variable; hence,                                     BC = BC(A + A) = ABC + ABC        Combining all terms, we have                               F = A + BC                                   = ABC + ABC + ABC + ABC + ABC        But ABC appears twice, and according to theorem 1 (x + x = x), it is possible to        remove one of those occurrences. Rearranging the minterms in ascending order, we        finally obtain                               F = ABC + ABC + ABC + ABC + ABC                                   = m1 + m4 + m5 + m6 + m7                                                                                                                               When a Boolean function is in its sum\\\\of\\\\minterms form, it is sometimes convenient to        express the function in the following brief notation:                                              F(A, B, C) = (1, 4, 5, 6, 7)        The summation symbol g stands for the ORing of terms; the numbers following it are        the indices of the minterms of the function. The letters in parentheses following F form        a list of the variables in the order taken when the minterm is converted to an AND term.            An alternative procedure for deriving the minterms of a Boolean function is to obtain        the truth table of the function directly from the algebraic expression and then read the        minterms from the truth table. Consider the Boolean function given in Example 2.4:                                                       F = A + BC        The truth table shown in Table 2.5 can be derived directly from the algebraic expres-        sion by listing the eight binary combinations under variables A, B, and C and inserting Table 2.5 Truth Table for F  A  BC A  B  C                                       F 0  0  0                                       0 0  0  1                                       1 0  1  0                                       0 0  1  1                                       0 1  0  0                                       1 1  0  1                                       1 1  1  0                                       1 1  1  1                                       1             1s under F for those combinations for which A = 1 and BC = 01. From the truth table,             we can then read the five minterms of the function to be 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Product of Maxterms             Each of the 22n functions of n binary variables can be also expressed as a product of             maxterms. To express a Boolean function as a product of maxterms, it must first be             brought into a form of OR terms. This may be done by using the distributive law,             x + yz = (x + y)(x + z). Then any missing variable x in each OR term is ORed with             xx. The procedure is clarified in the following example.     EXAMPLE 2.5             Express the Boolean function F = xy + xz as a product of maxterms. First, convert             the function into OR terms by using the distributive law:                                              F = xy + xz = (xy + x)(xy + z)                                                  = (x + x)(y + x)(x + z)(y + z)                                                  = (x + y)(x + z)(y + z)             The function has three variables: x, y, and z. Each OR term is missing one variable;             therefore,                                   x + y = x + y + zz = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)                                     x + z = x + z + yy = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)                                     y + z = y + z + xx = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)             Combining all the terms and removing those which appear more than once, we finally             obtain                                 F = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z)                                    = M0M2M4M5                                                      Section 2.6 Canonical and Standard Forms 55             A convenient way to express this function is as follows:                                                      F(x, y, z) = (0, 2, 4, 5)             The product symbol, , denotes the ANDing of maxterms; the numbers are the indices             of the maxterms of the function.                                                                                                                             Conversion between Canonical Forms             The complement of a function expressed as the sum of minterms equals the sum of min-             terms missing from the original function. This is because the original function is expressed             by those minterms which make the function equal to 1, whereas its complement is a 1 for             those minterms for which the function is a 0. As an example, consider the function                                                   F(A, B, C) = (1, 4, 5, 6, 7)             This function has a complement that can be expressed as                                         F(A, B, C) = (0, 2, 3) = m0 + m2 + m3             Now, if we take the complement of F by DeMorgans theorem, we obtain F in a differ-             ent form:                   F = (m0 + m2 + m3) = m0= # m2= # m3= = M0M2M3 = (0, 2, 3)             The last conversion follows from the definition of minterms and maxterms as shown in             Table 2.3. From the table, it is clear that the following relation holds:                                                                mj= = Mj             That is, the maxterm with subscript j is a complement of the minterm with the same             subscript j and vice versa.                 The last example demonstrates the conversion between a function expressed in sum\\\\             of\\\\minterms form and its equivalent in product\\\\of\\\\maxterms form. A similar argument             will show that the conversion between the product of maxterms and the sum of minterms             is similar. We now state a general conversion procedure: To convert from one canonical             form to another, interchange the symbols  and  and list those numbers missing from             the original form. In order to find the missing terms, one must realize that the total number             of minterms or maxterms is 2n, where n is the number of binary variables in the function.                 A Boolean function can be converted from an algebraic expression to a product of             maxterms by means of a truth table and the canonical conversion procedure. Consider,             for example, the Boolean expression                                                            F = xy + xz             First, we derive the truth table of the function, as shown in Table 2.6. The 1s under F in             the table are determined from the combination of the variables for which xy = 11 or             xz = 01. The minterms of the function are read from the truth table to be 1, 3, 6, and 7.             The function expressed as a sum of minterms is                                                      F(x, y, z) = (1, 3, 6, 7) Table 2.6 Truth Table for F  xy  xz x  y  z                    F 0  0  0                    0                  Minterms                                               Maxterms 0  0  1                    1 0  1  0                    0 0  1  1                    1 1  0  0                    0 1  0  1                    0 1  1  0                    1 1  1  1                    1             Since there is a total of eight minterms or maxterms in a function of three variables, we             determine the missing terms to be 0, 2, 4, and 5. The function expressed as a product of             maxterms is                                                      F(x, y, z) = (0, 2, 4, 5)             the same answer as obtained in Example 2.5. Standard Forms             The two canonical forms of Boolean algebra are basic forms that one obtains from read-             ing a given function from the truth table. These forms are very seldom the ones with the             least number of literals, because each minterm or maxterm must contain, by definition,             all the variables, either complemented or uncomplemented.                 Another way to express Boolean functions is in standard form. In this configuration,             the terms that form the function may contain one, two, or any number of literals. There             are two types of standard forms: the sum of products and products of sums.                 The sum of products is a Boolean expression containing AND terms, called product             terms, with one or more literals each. The sum denotes the ORing of these terms. An             example of a function expressed as a sum of products is                                                       F1 = y + xy + xyz             The expression has three product terms, with one, two, and three literals. Their sum is,             in effect, an OR operation.                 The logic diagram of a sum\\\\of\\\\products expression consists of a group of AND gates             followed by a single OR gate. This configuration pattern is shown in Fig. 2.3(a). Each             product term requires an AND gate, except for a term with a single literal. The logic sum             is formed with an OR gate whose inputs are the outputs of the AND gates and the             single literal. It is assumed that the input variables are directly available in their comple-             ments, so inverters are not included in the diagram. This circuit configuration is referred             to as a two\\\\level implementation.

Each term may have any number of literals. The product denotes the ANDing of these    terms. An example of a function expressed as a product of sums is                                         F2 = x(y + z)(x + y + z)    This expression has three sum terms, with one, two, and three literals. The product is an    AND operation. The use of the words product and sum stems from the similarity of the    AND operation to the arithmetic product (multiplication) and the similarity of the OR    operation to the arithmetic sum (addition). The gate structure of the product\\\\of\\\\sums    expression consists of a group of OR gates for the sum terms (except for a single literal),    followed by an AND gate, as shown in Fig. 2.3(b). This standard type of expression    results in a two\\\\level structure of gates.       A Boolean function may be expressed in a nonstandard form. For example, the function                                             F3 = AB + C(D + E)    is neither in sum\\\\of\\\\products nor in product\\\\of\\\\sums form. The implementation of this    expression is shown in Fig. 2.4(a) and requires two AND gates and two OR gates. There    are three levels of gating in this circuit. It can be changed to a standard form by using    the distributive law to remove the parentheses:                               F3 = AB + C(D + E) = AB + CD + CE             The sum\\\\of\\\\products expression is implemented in Fig. 2.4(b). In general, a two\\\\level             implementation is preferred because it produces the least amount of delay through the             gates when the signal propagates from the inputs to the output. However, the number             of inputs to a given gate might not be practical. 2.7  OTHER LOGIC OPERATIONS       When the binary operators AND and OR are placed between two variables, x and y,      they form two Boolean functions, x # y and x + y, respectively. Previously we stated that       there are 22n functions for n binary variables. Thus, for two variables, n = 2, and the       number of possible Boolean functions is 16. Therefore, the AND and OR functions       are only 2 of a total of 16 possible functions formed with two binary variables. It would       be instructive to find the other 14 functions and investigate their properties.          The truth tables for the 16 functions formed with two binary variables are listed in       Table 2.7. Each of the 16 columns, F0 to F15, represents a truth table of one possible func-       tion for the two variables, x and y. Note that the functions are determined from the       16 binary combinations that can be assigned to F. The 16 functions can be expressed       algebraically by means of Boolean functions, as is shown in the first column of Table 2.8.       The Boolean expressions listed are simplified to their minimum number of literals.          Although each function can be expressed in terms of the Boolean operators AND,       OR, and NOT, there is no reason one cannot assign special operator symbols for express-       ing the other functions. Such operator symbols are listed in the second column of       Table 2.8. However, of all the new symbols shown, only the exclusive\\\\OR symbol, ,       is in common use by digital designers.          Each of the functions in Table 2.8 is listed with an accompanying name and a com-       ment that explains the function in some way.1 The 16 functions listed can be subdivided       into three categories:          1. Two functions that produce a constant 0 or 1.          2. Four functions with unary operations: complement and transfer.          3. Ten functions with binary operators that define eight different operations: AND,              OR, NAND, NOR, exclusive\\\\OR, equivalence, inhibition, and implication.

The symbol for the AND function is      sometimes omitted from the product of two variables, e.g., xy.

The complement function produces the complement of each of the binary variables. A function that is equal to an input variable has been given the name transfer, because the variable x or y is transferred through the gate that forms the function without changing its value. Of the eight binary operators, two (inhibition and implication) are used by logicians, but are seldom used in computer logic. The AND and OR operators have been mentioned in conjunction with Boolean algebra. The other four functions are used extensively in the design of digital systems.    The NOR function is the complement of the OR function, and its name is an abbreviation of not\\\\OR. Similarly, NAND is the complement of AND and is an abbreviation of not\\\\AND. The exclusive\\\\OR, abbreviated XOR, is similar to OR, but excludes the combination of both x and y being equal to 1; it holds only when x and y differ in value. (It is sometimes referred to as the binary difference operator.) Equiv- alence is a function that is 1 when the two binary variables are equal (i.e., when both are 0 or both are 1). The exclusive\\\\OR and equivalence functions are the comple- ments of each other. This can be easily verified by inspecting Table 2.7: The truth table for exclusive\\\\OR is F6 and for equivalence is F9, and these two functions are the complements of each other. For this reason, the equivalence function is called exclusive\\\\NOR, abbreviated XNOR.                 Boolean algebra, as defined in Section 2.2, has two binary operators, which we have             called AND and OR, and a unary operator, NOT (complement). From the definitions,             we have deduced a number of properties of these operators and now have defined other             binary operators in terms of them. There is nothing unique about this procedure. We             could have just as well started with the operator NOR ( T ), for example, and later             defined AND, OR, and NOT in terms of it. There are, nevertheless, good reasons for             introducing Boolean algebra in the way it has been introduced. The concepts of and,             or, and not are familiar and are used by people to express everyday logical ideas.             Moreover, the Huntington postulates reflect the dual nature of the algebra, emphasizing         the symmetry of + and # with respect to each other. 2.8  DIGITAL LOGIC GATES       Since Boolean functions are expressed in terms of AND, OR, and NOT operations, it is       easier to implement a Boolean function with these type of gates. Still, the possibility of       constructing gates for the other logic operations is of practical interest. Factors to be       weighed in considering the construction of other types of logic gates are (1) the feasibil-       ity and economy of producing the gate with physical components, (2) the possibility of       extending the gate to more than two inputs, (3) the basic properties of the binary oper-       ator, such as commutativity and associativity, and (4) the ability of the gate to implement       Boolean functions alone or in conjunction with other gates.          Of the 16 functions defined in Table 2.8, two are equal to a constant and four are       repeated. There are only 10 functions left to be considered as candidates for logic gates.       Twoinhibition and implicationare not commutative or associative and thus are       impractical to use as standard logic gates. The other eightcomplement, transfer, AND,       OR, NAND, NOR, exclusive\\\\OR, and equivalenceare used as standard gates in       digital design.          The graphic symbols and truth tables of the eight gates are shown in Fig. 2.5. Each       gate has one or two binary input variables, designated by x and y, and one binary output       variable, designated by F. The AND, OR, and inverter circuits were defined in Fig. 1.6.       The inverter circuit inverts the logic sense of a binary variable, producing the NOT, or       complement, function. The small circle in the output of the graphic symbol of an inverter       (referred to as a bubble) designates the logic complement. The triangle symbol by itself       designates a buffer circuit. A buffer produces the transfer function, but does not produce       a logic operation, since the binary value of the output is equal to the binary value of the       input. This circuit is used for power amplification of the signal and is equivalent to two       inverters connected in cascade.          The NAND function is the complement of the AND function, as indicated by a       graphic symbol that consists of an AND graphic symbol followed by a small circle. The       NOR function is the complement of the OR function and uses an OR graphic symbol       followed by a small circle. NAND and NOR gates are used extensively as standard logic       gates and are in fact far more popular than the AND and OR gates. This is because       NAND and NOR gates are easily constructed with transistor circuits and because digital       circuits can be easily implemented with them.

The equivalence, or exclusive\\\\NOR, gate             is the complement of the exclusive\\\\OR, as indicated by the small circle on the output             side of the graphic symbol. Extension to Multiple Inputs             The gates shown in Fig. 2.5except for the inverter and buffercan be extended to             have more than two inputs. A gate can be extended to have multiple inputs if the binary             operation it represents is commutative and associative. The AND and OR operations,             defined in Boolean algebra, possess these two properties. For the OR function, we have                                                x + y = y + x (commutative)             and                                (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) = x + y + z (associative)             which indicates that the gate inputs can be interchanged and that the OR function can             be extended to three or more variables.                 The NAND and NOR functions are commutative, and their gates can be extended             to have more than two inputs, provided that the definition of the operation is modified             slightly. The difficulty is that the NAND and NOR operators are not associative             (i.e., (x T y) T z  x T (y T z)), as shown in Fig. 2.6 and the following equations:                                 (x T y) T z = [(x + y) + z] = (x + y)z = xz + yz                                 x T (y T z) = [x + (y + z)] = x(y + z) = xy + xz             To overcome this difficulty, we define the multiple NOR (or NAND) gate as a             complemented OR (or AND) gate. Thus, by definition, we have                                                     x T y T z = (x + y + z)                                                   x c y c z = (xyz)             The graphic symbols for the three\\\\input gates are shown in Fig. 2.7. In writing cascaded             NOR and NAND operations, one must use the correct parentheses to signify the proper             sequence of the gates. To demonstrate this principle, consider the circuit of Fig. 2.7(c).             The Boolean function for the circuit must be written as                                             F = [(ABC)(DE)] = ABC + DE             The second expression is obtained from one of DeMorgans theorems. It also shows that             an expression in sum\\\\of\\\\products form can be implemented with NAND gates. (NAND             and NOR gates are discussed further in Section 3.7.)                 The exclusive\\\\OR and equivalence gates are both commutative and associative and             can be extended to more than two inputs. However, multiple\\\\input exclusive\\\\OR gates             are uncommon from the hardware standpoint. In fact, even a two\\\\input function is usu-             ally constructed with other types of gates. Moreover, the definition of the function must             be modified when extended to more than two variables. Exclusive\\\\OR is an odd function             (i.e., it is equal to 1 if the input variables have an odd number of 1s).

This function is normally             implemented by cascading two\\\\input gates, as shown in (a). Graphically, it can be             represented with a single three\\\\input gate, as shown in (b). The truth table in (c) clearly             indicates that the output F is equal to 1 if only one input is equal to 1 or if all three inputs             are equal to 1 (i.e., when the total number of 1s in the input variables is odd). (Exclusive\\\\             OR gates are discussed further in Section 3.9.) Positive and Negative Logic             The binary signal at the inputs and outputs of any gate has one of two values, except             during transition. One signal value represents logic 1 and the other logic 0. Since two             signal values are assigned to two logic values, there exist two different assignments of x                                                         xyz                F y                                                 Fxyz      000                0 z             (a) Using 2-input gates                       001                1                                                           010                1                                                           011                0                                                           100                1                                                           101                0                       x                                   110                0                       y                       z                      Fxyz         111                1                            (b) 3-input gate               (c) Truth table FIGURE 2.8 Three\\\\input exclusive\\\\OR gate Logic                      Signal                  Logic  Signal value                      value                   value  value   1                          H                       0      H 0                                            L     1                      L        (a) Positive logic                             (b) Negative logic FIGURE 2.9 Signal assignment and logic polarity signal level to logic value, as shown in Fig. 2.9. The higher signal level is designated by H and the lower signal level by L. Choosing the high\\\\level H to represent logic 1 defines a positive logic system. Choosing the low\\\\level L to represent logic 1 defines a negative logic system. The terms positive and negative are somewhat misleading, since both sig- nals may be positive or both may be negative. It is not the actual values of the signals that determine the type of logic, but rather the assignment of logic values to the relative amplitudes of the two signal levels.    Hardware digital gates are defined in terms of signal values such as H and L. It is up to the user to decide on a positive or negative logic polarity. Consider, for example, the electronic gate shown in Fig. 2.10(b). The truth table for this gate is listed in Fig. 2.10(a). It specifies the physical behavior of the gate when H is 3 V and L is 0 V. The truth table of Fig. 2.10(c) assumes a positive logic assignment, with H = 1 and L = 0. This truth table is the same as the one for the AND operation. The graphic symbol for a positive logic AND gate is shown in Fig. 2.10(d).    Now consider the negative logic assignment for the same physical gate with L = 1 and H = 0. The result is the truth table of Fig. 2.10(e). This table represents the OR operation, even though the entries are reversed. The graphic symbol for the negative\\\\ logic OR gate is shown in Fig. 2.10(f).

Thus, the same physical gate can operate either as a positive\\\\logic AND gate or as a negative\\\\logic OR gate.    The conversion from positive logic to negative logic and vice versa is essentially an operation that changes 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s in both the inputs and the output of a gate. Since this operation produces the dual of a function, the change of all ter- minals from one polarity to the other results in taking the dual of the function. The upshot is that all AND operations are converted to OR operations (or graphic sym- bols) and vice versa. In addition, one must not forget to include the polarity\\\\indicator triangle in the graphic symbols when negative logic is assumed. In this book, we will not use negative logic gates and will assume that all gates operate with a positive logic assignment. 2.9 INTEGRATED CIRCUITS             An integrated circuit (IC) is fabricated on a die of a silicon semiconductor crystal, called             a chip, containing the electronic components for constructing digital gates. The complex             chemical and physical processes used to form a semiconductor circuit are not a subject             of this book. The various gates are interconnected inside the chip to form the required             circuit. The chip is mounted in a ceramic or plastic container, and connections are welded             to external pins to form the integrated circuit. The number of pins may range from 14             on a small IC package to several thousand on a larger package. Each IC has a numeric             designation printed on the surface of the package for identification. Vendors provide             data books, catalogs, and Internet websites that contain descriptions and information             about the ICs that they manufacture. Levels of Integration             Digital ICs are often categorized according to the complexity of their circuits, as mea-             sured by the number of logic gates in a single package. The differentiation between those             chips which have a few internal gates and those having hundreds of thousands of gates             is made by customary reference to a package as being either a small\\\\, medium\\\\, large\\\\,             or very large\\\\scale integration device.                 Small\\\\scale integration (SSI) devices contain several independent gates in a single             package. The inputs and outputs of the gates are connected directly to the pins in the             package. The number of gates is usually fewer than 10 and is limited by the number of             pins available in the IC.                 Medium\\\\scale integration (MSI) devices have a complexity of approximately 10 to             1,000 gates in a single package. They usually perform specific elementary digital opera-             tions. MSI digital functions are introduced in Chapter 4 as decoders, adders, and multi-             plexers and in Chapter 6 as registers and counters.                 Large\\\\scale integration (LSI) devices contain thousands of gates in a single package.             They include digital systems such as processors, memory chips, and programmable logic             devices. Some LSI components are presented in Chapter 7.                 Very large\\\\scale integration (VLSI) devices now contain millions of gates within a             single package. Examples are large memory arrays and complex microcomputer chips.             Because of their small size and low cost, VLSI devices have revolutionized the computer             system design technology, giving the designer the capability to create structures that             were previously uneconomical to build. Digital Logic Families             Digital integrated circuits are classified not only by their complexity or logical operation,             but also by the specific circuit technology to which they belong. The circuit technology             is referred to as a digital logic family. Each logic family has its own basic electronic             circuit upon which more complex digital circuits and components are developed. The             basic circuit in each technology is a NAND, NOR, or inverter gate. The electronic                                                          Section 2.9 Integrated Circuits 67 components employed in the construction of the basic circuit are usually used to name the technology. Many different logic families of digital integrated circuits have been introduced commercially. The following are the most popular: TTL   transistorCtransistor logic; ECL   emitter\\\\coupled logic; MOS   metal\\\\oxide semiconductor; CMOS  complementary metal\\\\oxide semiconductor.    TTL is a logic family that has been in use for 50 years and is considered to be stan- dard. ECL has an advantage in systems requiring high\\\\speed operation. MOS is suitable for circuits that need high component density, and CMOS is preferable in systems requiring low power consumption, such as digital cameras, personal media players, and other handheld portable devices. Low power consumption is essential for VLSI design; therefore, CMOS has become the dominant logic family, while TTL and ECL continue to decline in use. The most important parameters distinguishing logic families are listed below; CMOS integrated circuits are discussed briefly in the appendix.    Fan\\\\out specifies the number of standard loads that the output of a typical gate can drive without impairing its normal operation. A standard load is usually defined as the amount of current needed by an input of another similar gate in the same family.    Fan\\\\in is the number of inputs available in a gate.    Power dissipation is the power consumed by the gate that must be available from the power supply.    Propagation delay is the average transition delay time for a signal to propagate from input to output. For example, if the input of an inverter switches from 0 to 1, the output will switch from 1 to 0, but after a time determined by the propagation delay of the device. The operating speed is inversely proportional to the propagation delay.    Noise margin is the maximum external noise voltage added to an input signal that does not cause an undesirable change in the circuit output. Computer\\\\Aided Design of VLSI Circuits             Integrated circuits having submicron geometric features are manufactured by optically             projecting patterns of light onto silicon wafers. Prior to exposure, the wafers are coated             with a photoresistive material that either hardens or softens when exposed to light.             Removing extraneous photoresist leaves patterns of exposed silicon. The exposed             regions are then implanted with dopant atoms to create a semiconductor material hav-             ing the electrical properties of transistors and the logical properties of gates. The design             process translates a functional specification or description of the circuit (i.e., what it must             do) into a physical specification or description (how it must be implemented in silicon).                 The design of digital systems with VLSI circuits containing millions of transistors and             gates is an enormous and formidable task. Systems of this complexity are usually impos-             sible to develop and verify without the assistance of computer\\\\aided design (CAD)             tools, which consist of software programs that support computer\\\\based representations             of circuits and aid in the development of digital hardware by automating the design             process. Electronic design automation (EDA) covers all phases of the design of inte-             grated circuits. A typical design flow for creating VLSI circuits consists of a sequence of             steps beginning with design entry (e.g., entering a schematic) and culminating with the             generation of the database that contains the photomask used to fabricate the IC. There             are a variety of options available for creating the physical realization of a digital circuit             in silicon. The designer can choose between an application\\\\specific integrated circuit             (ASIC), a field\\\\programmable gate array (FPGA), a programmable logic device (PLD),             and a full\\\\custom IC. With each of these devices comes a set of CAD tools that provide             the necessary software to facilitate the hardware fabrication of the unit. Each of these             technologies has a market niche determined by the size of the market and the unit cost             of the devices that are required to implement a design.                 Some CAD systems include an editing program for creating and modifying schematic             diagrams on a computer screen. This process is called schematic capture or schematic             entry. With the aid of menus, keyboard commands, and a mouse, a schematic editor can             draw circuit diagrams of digital circuits on the computer screen. Components can be             placed on the screen from a list in an internal library and can then be connected with             lines that represent wires. The schematic entry software creates and manages a database             containing the information produced with the schematic. Primitive gates and functional             blocks have associated models that allow the functionality (i.e., logical behavior) and             timing of the circuit to be verified. Verification is performed by applying inputs to the             circuit and using a logic simulator to determine and display the outputs in text or wave-             form format.                 An important development in the design of digital systems is the use of a hardware             description language (HDL). Such a language resembles a computer programming             language, but is specifically oriented to describing digital hardware. It represents logic             diagrams and other digital information in textual form to describe the functionality             and structure of a circuit. Moreover, the HDL description of a circuits functionality             can be abstract, without reference to specific hardware, thereby freeing a designer to             devote attention to higher level functional detail (e.g., under certain conditions the             circuit must detect a particular pattern of 1s and 0s in a serial bit stream of data) rather             than transistor\\\\level detail. HDL\\\\based models of a circuit or system are simulated to             check and verify its functionality before it is submitted to fabrication, thereby reducing             the risk and waste of manufacturing a circuit that fails to operate correctly. In tandem             with the emergence of HDL\\\\based design languages, tools have been developed to             automatically and optimally synthesize the logic described by an HDL model of a             circuit. These two advances in technology have led to an almost total reliance by indus-             try on HDL\\\\based synthesis tools and methodologies for the design of the circuits of             complex digital systems. Two HDLsVerilog and VHDLhave been approved as             standards by the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers (IEEE) and are in             use by design teams worldwide. The Verilog HDL is introduced in Section 3.10, and             because of its importance, we include several exercises and design problems based on             Verilog throughout the book.

This task is well understood,       but is difficult to execute by manual methods when the logic has more than a few inputs.       Fortunately, computer-based logic synthesis tools can minimize a large set of Boolean       equations efficiently and quickly. Nevertheless, it is important that a designer understand       the underlying mathematical description and solution of the problem. This chapter serves       as a foundation for your understanding of that important topic and will enable you to       execute a manual design of simple circuits, preparing you for skilled use of modern       design tools. The chapter will also introduce a hardware description language that is used       by modern design tools. 3.2  THE MAP METHOD       The complexity of the digital logic gates that implement a Boolean function is directly       related to the complexity of the algebraic expression from which the function is imple-       mented. Although the truth table representation of a function is unique, when it is expressed       algebraically it can appear in many different, but equivalent, forms. Boolean expressions may       be simplified by algebraic means as discussed in Section 2.4. However, this procedure of       minimization is awkward because it lacks specific rules to predict each succeeding step in       the manipulative process. The map method presented here provides a simple, straightforward       procedure for minimizing Boolean functions. This method may be regarded as a pictorial       form of a truth table.The map method is also known as the Karnaugh map or K-map.                                                                                                                    73                 A K-map is a diagram made up of squares, with each square representing one minterm             of the function that is to be minimized. Since any Boolean function can be expressed as a             sum of minterms, it follows that a Boolean function is recognized graphically in the map             from the area enclosed by those squares whose minterms are included in the function. In             fact, the map presents a visual diagram of all possible ways a function may be expressed             in standard form. By recognizing various patterns, the user can derive alternative algebraic             expressions for the same function, from which the simplest can be selected.                 The simplified expressions produced by the map are always in one of the two standard             forms: sum of products or product of sums. It will be assumed that the simplest algebraic             expression is an algebraic expression with a minimum number of terms and with the             smallest possible number of literals in each term. This expression produces a circuit             diagram with a minimum number of gates and the minimum number of inputs to each             gate. We will see subsequently that the simplest expression is not unique: It is sometimes             possible to find two or more expressions that satisfy the minimization criteria. In that             case, either solution is satisfactory. Two-Variable K-Map             The two-variable map is shown in Fig. 3.1(a). There are four minterms for two variables;             hence, the map consists of four squares, one for each minterm. The map is redrawn in             (b) to show the relationship between the squares and the two variables x and y. The 0             and 1 marked in each row and column designate the values of variables. Variable x             appears primed in row 0 and unprimed in row 1. Similarly, y appears primed in column             0 and unprimed in column 1.                 If we mark the squares whose minterms belong to a given function, the two-variable             map becomes another useful way to represent any one of the 16 Boolean functions of             two variables. As an example, the function xy is shown in Fig. 3.2(a). Since xy is equal to             m3, a 1 is placed inside the square that belongs to m3. Similarly, the function x + y is             represented in the map of Fig. 3.2(b) by three squares marked with 1s. These squares             are found from the minterms of the function:                                         m1 + m2 + m3 = xy + xy + xy = x + y                                  x  y      0     y                                        m0        1                     m0       m1     0 xy      m1                                                 xy                                        m2     m3                     m2       m3  x 1 xy xy                         (a)                   (b) FIGURE 3.1 Two-variable K-map                                                 Section 3.2 The Map Method 75                                            y                           y                                            1     x   y                                       x  y                                         m1                                     0                     0            1                                         m3            m0                                         m0           m1           y                                            1         0                                          0                   1               m2                                           m2      m3     x1                                          x1 1                  1                                         (a) xy  x                                                          (b) x  y FIGURE 3.2 Representation of functions in the map The three squares could also have been determined from the intersection of variable x in the second row and variable y in the second column, which encloses the area belonging to x or y. In each example, the minterms at which the function is asserted are marked with a 1. Three-Variable K-Map             A three-variable K-map is shown in Fig. 3.3. There are eight minterms for three binary             variables; therefore, the map consists of eight squares. Note that the minterms are             arranged, not in a binary sequence, but in a sequence similar to the Gray code (Table 1.6).             The characteristic of this sequence is that only one bit changes in value from one adjacent             column to the next. The map drawn in part (b) is marked with numbers in each row and             each column to show the relationship between the squares and the three variables. For             example, the square assigned to m5 corresponds to row 1 and column 01.When these two             numbers are concatenated, they give the binary number 101, whose decimal equivalent             is 5. Each cell of the map corresponds to a unique minterm, so another way of looking at             square m5 = xyz is to consider it to be in the row marked x and the column belonging             to yz (column 01). Note that there are four squares in which each variable is equal to 1             and four in which each is equal to 0. The variable appears unprimed in the former four                                                       yz                            y                                                    x           00        01    11     10                                                           m0           m1    m3     m2 m0  m1                              m3  m2            0 xyz             xyz   xyz    xyz                                                           m4           m5    m7     m6 m4  m5                              m7  m6      x 1 xyz xyz                    xyz   xyz                                (a)                                          z                                                                            (b) FIGURE 3.3 Three-variable K-map             squares and primed in the latter. For convenience, we write the variable with its letter             symbol under the four squares in which it is unprimed.                 To understand the usefulness of the map in simplifying Boolean functions, we must             recognize the basic property possessed by adjacent squares: Any two adjacent squares             in the map differ by only one variable, which is primed in one square and unprimed in             the other. For example, m5 and m7 lie in two adjacent squares. Variable y is primed in             m5 and unprimed in m7, whereas the other two variables are the same in both squares.             From the postulates of Boolean algebra, it follows that the sum of two minterms in             adjacent squares can be simplified to a single product term consisting of only two liter-             als. To clarify this concept, consider the sum of two adjacent squares such as m5 and m7:                                         m5 + m7 = xyz + xyz = xz(y + y) = xz             Here, the two squares differ by the variable y, which can be removed when the sum of             the two minterms is formed. Thus, any two minterms in adjacent squares (vertically or             horizontally, but not diagonally, adjacent) that are ORed together will cause a removal             of the dissimilar variable. The next four examples explain the procedure for minimizing             a Boolean function with a K-map. EXAMPLE 3.1        Simplify the Boolean function                                                F (x, y, z) = (2, 3, 4, 5)        First, a 1 is marked in each minterm square that represents the function. This is shown        in Fig. 3.4, in which the squares for minterms 010, 011, 100, and 101 are marked with 1s.        The next step is to find possible adjacent squares. These are indicated in the map by two        shaded rectangles, each enclosing two 1s. The upper right rectangle represents the area        enclosed by xy. This area is determined by observing that the two-square area is in row        0, corresponding to x, and the last two columns, corresponding to y. Similarly, the lower        left rectangle represents the product term xy. (The second row represents x and the        two left columns represent y.) The sum of four minterms can be replaced by a sum of    yz                    y         xy x          00 01 11 10        m0  m1     m3        m2    0                  1         1        m4  m5     m7        m6 x1 1           1    xy             z FIGURE 3.4 Map for Example 3.1, F (x, y, z) = (2, 3, 4, 5) = xy + xy                                                            Section 3.2 The Map Method 77 only two product terms. The logical sum of these two product terms gives the simplified expression                                               F = xy + xy                                                                                                                   In certain cases, two squares in the map are considered to be adjacent even though they do not touch each other. In Fig. 3.3(b), m0 is adjacent to m2 and m4 is adjacent to m6 because their minterms differ by one variable. This difference can be readily verified algebraically:                      m0 + m2 = xyz + xyz = xz(y + y) = xz                      m4 + m6 = xyz + xyz = xz + ( y + y) = xz Consequently, we must modify the definition of adjacent squares to include this and other similar cases. We do so by considering the map as being drawn on a surface in which the right and left edges touch each other to form adjacent squares. EXAMPLE 3.2        Simplify the Boolean function                                               F (x, y, z) = (3, 4, 6, 7)        The map for this function is shown in Fig. 3.5. There are four squares marked with 1s,        one for each minterm of the function. Two adjacent squares are combined in the third        column to give a two-literal term yz. The remaining two squares with 1s are also adja-        cent by the new definition. These two squares, when combined, give the two-literal term        xz. The simplified function then becomes                                                       F = yz + xz                yz                     y             x           00 01 11 10                     m0  m1     m3        m2    yz                  0                 1                     m4  m5     m7        m6             x1 1                  1         1             xyz             z                  xyz                         Note: xyz  xyz  xz FIGURE 3.5 Map for Example 3.2, F (x, y, z) = (3, 4, 6, 7) = yz + xz                   Consider now any combination of four adjacent squares in the three-variable map.             Any such combination represents the logical sum of four minterms and results in an             expression with only one literal. As an example, the logical sum of the four adjacent             minterms 0, 2, 4, and 6 reduces to the single literal term z:                                 m0 + m2 + m4 + m6 = xyz + xyz + xyz + xyz                                                              = xz(y + y) + xz(y + y)                                                              = xz + xz = z(x + x) = z                 The number of adjacent squares that may be combined must always represent a             number that is a power of two, such as 1, 2, 4, and 8. As more adjacent squares are com-             bined, we obtain a product term with fewer literals.                     One square represents one minterm, giving a term with three literals.                     Two adjacent squares represent a term with two literals.                     Four adjacent squares represent a term with one literal.                     Eight adjacent squares encompass the entire map and produce a function that is                     always equal to 1. EXAMPLE 3.3 Simplify the Boolean function              F (x, y, z) = (0, 2, 4, 5, 6) The map for F is shown in Fig. 3.6. First, we combine the four adjacent squares in the first and last columns to give the single literal term z. The remaining single square, representing minterm 5, is combined with an adjacent square that has already been used once. This is not only permissible, but rather desirable, because the two adjacent squares give the two-literal term xy and the single square represents the three-literal minterm xyz. The simplified function is                                    F = z + xy                                               y              yz              yz x m 00 m 01 m 11 m 10 yz01   3      2              01                                        1                                m4  m5        m7     m6              x1 1                      1               1              xy                           z                                    Note: yz  yz  z FIGURE 3.6 Map for Example 3.3, F (x, y, z) = (0, 2, 4, 5, 6) = z + xy                                                                                                                                                                       Section 3.2 The Map Method 79    If a function is not expressed in sum-of-minterms form, it is possible to use the map to obtain the minterms of the function and then simplify the function to an expression with a minimum number of terms. It is necessary, however, to make sure that the algebraic expres- sion is in sum-of-products form. Each product term can be plotted in the map in one, two, or more squares. The minterms of the function are then read directly from the map. EXAMPLE 3.4        For the Boolean function                                           F = AC + AB + ABC + BC           (a) Express this function as a sum of minterms.           (b) Find the minimal sum-of-products expression.        Note that F is a sum of products. Three product terms in the expression have two literals        and are represented in a three-variable map by two squares each. The two squares cor-        responding to the first term, AC, are found in Fig. 3.7 from the coincidence of A (first        row) and C (two middle columns) to give squares 001 and 011. Note that, in marking        1s in the squares, it is possible to find a 1 already placed there from a preceding term.        This happens with the second term, AB, which has 1s in squares 011 and 010. Square        011 is common with the first term, AC, though, so only one 1 is marked in it. Continu-        ing in this fashion, we determine that the term ABC belongs in square 101, correspond-        ing to minterm 5, and the term BC has two 1s in squares 011 and 111. The function has        a total of five minterms, as indicated by the five 1s in the map of Fig. 3.7. The minterms        are read directly from the map to be 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. The function can be expressed in        sum-of-minterms form as                                              F (A, B, C ) = (1, 2, 3, 5, 7)        The sum-of-products expression, as originally given, has too many terms. It can be        simplified, as shown in the map, to an expression with only two terms:                                                       F = C + AB                            B     BC          01    11     10  AB  A 00               m1    m3     m2           m0                  1     1      1     0               m5    m7     m6           m4                  1      1 A1                                                                 C                                                                                   C FIGURE 3.7 Map of Example 3.4, AC  AB  ABC  BC  C  AB                                                                                                            3.3 FOUR-VARIABLE K-MAP             The map for Boolean functions of four binary variables (w, x, y, z) is shown in Fig. 3.8.             In Fig. 3.8(a) are listed the 16 minterms and the squares assigned to each. In Fig. 3.8(b),             the map is redrawn to show the relationship between the squares and the four variables.             The rows and columns are numbered in a Gray code sequence, with only one digit             changing value between two adjacent rows or columns. The minterm corresponding to             each square can be obtained from the concatenation of the row number with the column             number. For example, the numbers of the third row (11) and the second column (01),             when concatenated, give the binary number 1101, the binary equivalent of decimal 13.             Thus, the square in the third row and second column represents minterm m13.                 The map minimization of four-variable Boolean functions is similar to the method             used to minimize three-variable functions. Adjacent squares are defined to be squares             next to each other. In addition, the map is considered to lie on a surface with the top             and bottom edges, as well as the right and left edges, touching each other to form adja-             cent squares. For example, m0 and m2 form adjacent squares, as do m3 and m11. The             combination of adjacent squares that is useful during the simplification process is easily             determined from inspection of the four-variable map:                    One square represents one minterm, giving a term with four literals.                    Two adjacent squares represent a term with three literals.                    Four adjacent squares represent a term with two literals.                    Eight adjacent squares represent a term with one literal.                    Sixteen adjacent squares produce a function that is always equal to 1.                 No other combination of squares can simplify the function. The next two examples             show the procedure used to simplify four-variable Boolean functions.                                  yz                           y                              wx          00     01        11        10                                      m0      m1        m3        m2 m0   m1            m3   m2       00 wxyz     wxyz      wxyz      wxyz                                      m4      m5        m7        m6 m4   m5            m7   m6       01 wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz                                      x m12                                              m13       m15       m14 m12  m13           m15  m14      11 wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz                              w m8            m9        m11       m10 m8   m9            m11  m10      10 wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz                                                     z           (a)                                     (b) FIGURE 3.8 Four-variable map                                                 Section 3.3 Four-Variable K-Map 81 EXAMPLE 3.5        Simplify the Boolean function                                  F (w, x, y, z) = (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14)        Since the function has four variables, a four-variable map must be used. The minterms        listed in the sum are marked by 1s in the map of Fig. 3.9. Eight adjacent squares marked        with 1s can be combined to form the one literal term y. The remaining three 1s on the        right cannot be combined to give a simplified term; they must be combined as two or        four adjacent squares. The larger the number of squares combined, the smaller is the        number of literals in the term. In this example, the top two 1s on the right are combined        with the top two 1s on the left to give the term wz. Note that it is permissible to use        the same square more than once. We are now left with a square marked by 1 in the third        row and fourth column (square 1110). Instead of taking this square alone (which will        give a term with four literals), we combine it with squares already used to form an area        of four adjacent squares. These squares make up the two middle rows and the two end        columns, giving the term xz. The simplified function is                                                  F = y + wz + xz                      yz                                  y                  wx          00             01       11       10             wyz          m0               m1       m3       m2                     00 1                     1                 1                            m4             m5       m7       m6           wyz                     01 1                     1                  1  x                                                                          xyz                                      m12  m13      m15      m14                          11 1                1                  1             xyz                                           m9       m11      m10                     w m8                          10 1                1                  y                              z                          Note: wyz  wyz  wz                                           xyz  xyz  xz FIGURE 3.9 Map for Example 3.5, F(w, x, y, z)  (0,1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14)  y  wz  xz                                                                      EXAMPLE 3.6        Simplify the Boolean function                                   F = ABC + BCD + ABCD + ABC        The area in the map covered by this function consists of the squares marked with 1s in        Fig. 3.10.

Each term with three literals is repre- sented in the map by two squares. For example, ABC is represented in squares 0000 and 0001. The function can be simplified in the map by taking the 1s in the four corners to give the term BD. This is possible because these four squares are adjacent when the map is drawn in a surface with top and bottom edges, as well as left and right edges, touching one another. The two left-hand 1s in the top row are combined with the two 1s in the bottom row to give the term BC. The remaining 1 may be combined in a two- square area to give the term ACD. The simplified function is                                      F = BD + BC + ACD                                                                                                                Prime Implicants             In choosing adjacent squares in a map, we must ensure that (1) all the minterms of the             function are covered when we combine the squares, (2) the number of terms in the             expression is minimized, and (3) there are no redundant terms (i.e., minterms already             covered by other terms). Sometimes there may be two or more expressions that satisfy             the simplification criteria. The procedure for combining squares in the map may be made             more systematic if we understand the meaning of two special types of terms. A prime             implicant is a product term obtained by combining the maximum possible number of             adjacent squares in the map. If a minterm in a square is covered by only one prime             implicant, that prime implicant is said to be essential.                                                              Section 3.3 Four-Variable K-Map 83          The prime implicants of a function can be obtained from the map by combining all       possible maximum numbers of squares. This means that a single 1 on a map represents       a prime implicant if it is not adjacent to any other 1s. Two adjacent 1s form a prime       implicant, provided that they are not within a group of four adjacent squares. Four       adjacent 1s form a prime implicant if they are not within a group of eight adjacent       squares, and so on. The essential prime implicants are found by looking at each square       marked with a 1 and checking the number of prime implicants that cover it. The prime       implicant is essential if it is the only prime implicant that covers the minterm.          Consider the following four-variable Boolean function:                              F( A, B, C, D) = (0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15)       The minterms of the function are marked with 1s in the maps of Fig. 3.11. The partial       map (Fig. 3.11(a)) shows two essential prime implicants, each formed by collapsing four       cells into a term having only two literals. One term is essential because there is only one       way to include minterm m0 within four adjacent squares. These four squares define the       term BD. Similarly, there is only one way that minterm m5 can be combined with four       adjacent squares, and this gives the second term BD. The two essential prime implicants       cover eight minterms. The three minterms that were omitted from the partial map       (m3, m9, and m11) must be considered next.          Figure 3.11(b) shows all possible ways that the three minterms can be covered with       prime implicants. Minterm m3 can be covered with either prime implicant CD or prime       implicant BC. Minterm m9 can be covered with either AD or AB. Minterm m11 is       covered with any one of the four prime implicants. The simplified expression is obtained       from the logical sum of the two essential prime implicants and any two prime implicants                                  C                               CD                              C       AB  CD  00    01     11      10                        AB            00    01         11       10           m0      m1     m3      m2       ABCD                         m0      m1         m3       m2       00 1                          1                            00 1          m5            1       1 ABCD      m4      m5     m7      m6                    CD              m4         1       m7     m6                                                          AD BD 01                 1       1                                  01            m13            1           B m12                                                        m12        1       m15    m14     B BC                   m13    m15     m14                                                                  11            m9       11              1       1                                                               1                                                                                   1       A m8        m9     m11     m10                         A   m                        m11    m10                                                                      8                       1      1       10 1                            1                          10 1 ABCD                                             ABCD                                  D                          D                                       AB       Note: ABCD  ABCD  ABD              ABCD  ABCD  ABD              ABD  ABD  BD           (a) Essential prime implicants                         (b) Prime implicants CD, BC,               BD and BD                                              AD, and AB       FIGURE 3.11       Simplification using prime implicants             that cover minterms m3, m9, and m11. There are four possible ways that the function can             be expressed with four product terms of two literals each:                                                  F = BD + BD + CD + AD                                                     = BD + BD + CD + AB                                                     = BD + BD + BC + AD                                                     = BD + BD + BC + AB             The previous example has demonstrated that the identification of the prime implicants in             the map helps in determining the alternatives that are available for obtaining a simplified             expression.                 The procedure for finding the simplified expression from the map requires that we             first determine all the essential prime implicants. The simplified expression is obtained             from the logical sum of all the essential prime implicants, plus other prime implicants             that may be needed to cover any remaining minterms not covered by the essential prime             implicants. Occasionally, there may be more than one way of combining squares, and             each combination may produce an equally simplified expression. Five-Variable Map             Maps for more than four variables are not as simple to use as maps for four or fewer             variables. A five-variable map needs 32 squares and a six-variable map needs 64 squares.             When the number of variables becomes large, the number of squares becomes excessive             and the geometry for combining adjacent squares becomes more involved.                 Maps for more than four variables are difficult to use and will not be considered here. 3.4  PRODUCT-OF-SUMS SIMPLIFICATION       The minimized Boolean functions derived from the map in all previous examples were       expressed in sum-of-products form. With a minor modification, the product-of-sums       form can be obtained.          The procedure for obtaining a minimized function in product-of-sums form follows       from the basic properties of Boolean functions. The 1s placed in the squares of the       map represent the minterms of the function. The minterms not included in the standard       sum-of-products form of a function denote the complement of the function. From this       observation, we see that the complement of a function is represented in the map by       the squares not marked by 1s. If we mark the empty squares by 0s and combine them       into valid adjacent squares, we obtain a simplified sum-of-products expression of the       complement of the function (i.e., of F). The complement of F gives us back the func-       tion F in product-of-sums form (a consequence of DeMorgans theorem). Because of       the generalized DeMorgans theorem, the function so obtained is automatically in       product-of-sums form. The best way to show this is by example.      Section 3.4 Product-of-Sums Simplification 85 EXAMPLE 3.7        Simplify the following Boolean function into (a) sum-of-products form and        (b) product-of-sums form:                                        F (A, B, C, D) = (0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10)        The 1s marked in the map of Fig. 3.12 represent all the minterms of the function. The        squares marked with 0s represent the minterms not included in F and therefore denote        the complement of F. Combining the squares with 1s gives the simplified function in        sum-of-products form:           (a) F = BD + BC + ACD                 If the squares marked with 0s are combined, as shown in the diagram, we obtain                 the simplified complemented function:                                                  F = AB + CD + BD          Applying DeMorgans theorem (by taking the dual and complementing each          literal as described in Section 2.4), we obtain the simplified function in product-          of-sums form:   (b) F = (A + B) (C + D) (B + D)                                                                                                                   The gate-level implementation of the simplified expressions obtained in Example 3.7 is shown in Fig. 3.13. The sum-of-products expression is implemented in (a) with a group of AND gates, one for each AND term. The outputs of the AND gates are connected to the inputs of a single OR gate. The same function is implemented in (b) in its product-of-sums                                     C       AB CD 00            01    11    10       CD                                           BCD                    m0   m1    m3    m2                                           B           00 1             1     0     1                                                AB BCD                m4   m5    m7    m6           01 0             1     0     0                    m12  m13   m15   m14           11 0             0     0     0      A m8                         m9    m11   m10           10 1                            1     0     1                                                                      D                                                     Note: BCD  BCD  BD FIGURE 3.12 Map for Example 3.7, F (A, B, C, D) = (0,1, 2, 5, 8, 9,10) = BD + BC + ACD = (A + B)(C + D)(B + D) B                                        A D                                        B                                 F        C                                       F C                                        D A                                        D                                                     (b) F  (A  B) (C  D) (B  D) D          (a) F  BD  BC  ACD    FIGURE 3.13    Gate implementations of the function of Example 3.7                              Table 3.1                              Truth Table of Function F                              x        y     z           F                              0        0     0           0                              0        0     1           1                              0        1     0           0                              0        1     1           1                              1        0     0           1                              1        0     1           0                              1        1     0           1                              1        1     1           0    form with a group of OR gates, one for each OR term. The outputs of the OR gates are    connected to the inputs of a single AND gate. In each case, it is assumed that the input    variables are directly available in their complement, so inverters are not needed. The con-    figuration pattern established in Fig. 3.13 is the general form by which any Boolean function    is implemented when expressed in one of the standard forms. AND gates are connected    to a single OR gate when in sum-of-products form; OR gates are connected to a single    AND gate when in product-of-sums form. Either configuration forms two levels of gates.    Thus, the implementation of a function in a standard form is said to be a two-level imple-    mentation. The two-level implementation may not be practical, depending on the number    of inputs to the gates.       Example 3.7 showed the procedure for obtaining the product-of-sums simplifica-    tion when the function is originally expressed in the sum-of-minterms canonical form.    The procedure is also valid when the function is originally expressed in the product-    of-maxterms canonical form. Consider, for example, the truth table that defines the    function F in Table 3.1. In sum-of-minterms form, this function is expressed as                                            F (x, y, z) = (1, 3, 4, 6)        Section 3.4 Product-of-Sums Simplification 87    yz                                                                y x          00 01 11 10        m0       m1        m3                                         m2     xz    00               1                                             1      0             m4  m5        m7                                         m6 x1 1               0         0                                          1                        z                                                               xz FIGURE 3.14 Map for the function of Table 3.1 In product-of-maxterms form, it is expressed as                                         F (x, y, z) = (0, 2, 5, 7) In other words, the 1s of the function represent the minterms and the 0s represent the maxterms. The map for this function is shown in Fig. 3.14. One can start simplify- ing the function by first marking the 1s for each minterm that the function is a 1. The remaining squares are marked by 0s. If, instead, the product of maxterms is initially given, one can start marking 0s in those squares listed in the function; the remaining squares are then marked by 1s. Once the 1s and 0s are marked, the function can be simplified in either one of the standard forms. For the sum of products, we combine the 1s to obtain                                               F = xz + xz For the product of sums, we combine the 0s to obtain the simplified complemented function                                               F = xz + xz which shows that the exclusive-OR function is the complement of the equivalence func- tion (Section 2.6). Taking the complement of F, we obtain the simplified function in product-of-sums form:                                           F = (x + z)(x + z) To enter a function expressed in product-of-sums form into the map, use the comple- ment of the function to find the squares that are to be marked by 0s. For example, the function                                     F = (A + B + C)(B + D) can be entered into the map by first taking its complement, namely,                                            F = ABC + BD             and then marking 0s in the squares representing the minterms of F. The remaining             squares are marked with 1s. 3.5  DONT-CARE CONDITIONS       The logical sum of the minterms associated with a Boolean function specifies the con-       ditions under which the function is equal to 1. The function is equal to 0 for the rest of       the minterms. This pair of conditions assumes that all the combinations of the values       for the variables of the function are valid. In practice, in some applications the function       is not specified for certain combinations of the variables. As an example, the four-bit       binary code for the decimal digits has six combinations that are not used and conse-       quently are considered to be unspecified. Functions that have unspecified outputs for       some input combinations are called incompletely specified functions. In most applica-       tions, we simply dont care what value is assumed by the function for the unspecified       minterms. For this reason, it is customary to call the unspecified minterms of a function       dont-care conditions. These dont-care conditions can be used on a map to provide       further simplification of the Boolean expression.          A dont-care minterm is a combination of variables whose logical value is not speci-       fied. Such a minterm cannot be marked with a 1 in the map, because it would require       that the function always be a 1 for such a combination. Likewise, putting a 0 on the       square requires the function to be 0. To distinguish the dont-care condition from 1s and       0s, an X is used. Thus, an X inside a square in the map indicates that we dont care       whether the value of 0 or 1 is assigned to F for the particular minterm.          In choosing adjacent squares to simplify the function in a map, the dont-care min-       terms may be assumed to be either 0 or 1. When simplifying the function, we can choose       to include each dont-care minterm with either the 1s or the 0s, depending on which       combination gives the simplest expression. EXAMPLE 3.8        Simplify the Boolean function                                           F (w, x, y, z) = (1, 3, 7, 11, 15)        which has the dont-care conditions                                            d (w, x, y, z) = (0, 2, 5)        The minterms of F are the variable combinations that make the function equal to 1. The        minterms of d are the dont-care minterms that may be assigned either 0 or 1. The map        simplification is shown in Fig. 3.15. The minterms of F are marked by 1s, those of d are        marked by Xs, and the remaining squares are filled with 0s. To get the simplified expres-        sion in sum-of-products form, we must include all five 1s in the map, but we may or may        not include any of the Xs, depending on the way the function is simplified. The term yz        covers the four minterms in the third column.The remaining minterm, m1, can be combined                                                          Section 3.5 Dont-Care Conditions 89     yz                           y                               yz                          y wx          00     01      11      10                        wx          00    01      11      10         m0       m1      m3      m2                                  m0      m1      m3      m2            00 X     1       1       X                            00 X           1       1       X wx                  m5                                      wz         m4               m7      m6                                  m4      m5      m7      m6                     X     01 0                    1       0                            01 0            X        1       0         x m12                                                        x m12                  m13     m15     m14                                         m13     m15     m14     11 0              0       1       0                          11 0             0      1        0 w m8             m9      m11     m10                         w m8            m9      m11     m10      10 0                                                         10 0                     0       1       0                                           0       1       0                                 z                                                      z                                                      yz                                                      yz                  (a) F  yz  wx                                           (b) F  yz  wz FIGURE 3.15 Example with dont-care conditions with minterm m3 to give the three-literal term wxz. However, by including one or two adjacent Xs we can combine four adjacent squares to give a two-literal term. In Fig. 3.15(a), dont-care minterms 0 and 2 are included with the 1s, resulting in the simpli- fied function                                               F = yz + wx In Fig. 3.15(b), dont-care minterm 5 is included with the 1s, and the simplified func- tion is now                                               F = yz + wz Either one of the preceding two expressions satisfies the conditions stated for this example.                                                                                                                   The previous example has shown that the dont-care minterms in the map are ini- tially marked with Xs and are considered as being either 0 or 1. The choice between 0 and 1 is made depending on the way the incompletely specified function is simplified. Once the choice is made, the simplified function obtained will consist of a sum of min- terms that includes those minterms which were initially unspecified and have been chosen to be included with the 1s. Consider the two simplified expressions obtained in Example 3.8:                      F (w, x, y, z) = yz + wx = (0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 15)                      F (w, x, y, z) = yz + wz = (1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15) Both expressions include minterms 1, 3, 7, 11, and 15 that make the function F equal to 1. The dont-care minterms 0, 2, and 5 are treated differently in each expression.             The first expression includes minterms 0 and 2 with the 1s and leaves minterm 5 with             the 0s. The second expression includes minterm 5 with the 1s and leaves minterms 0             and 2 with the 0s. The two expressions represent two functions that are not algebra-             ically equal. Both cover the specified minterms of the function, but each covers dif-             ferent dont-care minterms. As far as the incompletely specified function is concerned,             either expression is acceptable because the only difference is in the value of F for the             dont-care minterms.                 It is also possible to obtain a simplified product-of-sums expression for the function             of Fig. 3.15. In this case, the only way to combine the 0s is to include dont-care minterms             0 and 2 with the 0s to give a simplified complemented function:                                                            F = z + wy             Taking the complement of F gives the simplified expression in product-of-sums form:                                      F (w, x, y, z) = z(w + y) = (1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15)             In this case, we include minterms 0 and 2 with the 0s and minterm 5 with the 1s. 3.6  NAND AND NOR IMPLEMENTATION       Digital circuits are frequently constructed with NAND or NOR gates rather than with       AND and OR gates. NAND and NOR gates are easier to fabricate with electronic       components and are the basic gates used in all IC digital logic families. Because of the       prominence of NAND and NOR gates in the design of digital circuits, rules and proce-       dures have been developed for the conversion from Boolean functions given in terms       of AND, OR, and NOT into equivalent NAND and NOR logic diagrams. NAND Circuits             The NAND gate is said to be a universal gate because any logic circuit can be imple-             mented with it. To show that any Boolean function can be implemented with NAND             gates, we need only show that the logical operations of AND, OR, and complement can             be obtained with NAND gates alone. This is indeed shown in Fig. 3.16. The complement             operation is obtained from a one-input NAND gate that behaves exactly like an inverter.             The AND operation requires two NAND gates. The first produces the NAND operation             and the second inverts the logical sense of the signal. The OR operation is achieved             through a NAND gate with additional inverters in each input.                 A convenient way to implement a Boolean function with NAND gates is to obtain             the simplified Boolean function in terms of Boolean operators and then convert the             function to NAND logic. The conversion of an algebraic expression from AND, OR, and             complement to NAND can be done by simple circuit manipulation techniques that             change ANDCOR diagrams to NAND diagrams.                 To facilitate the conversion to NAND logic, it is convenient to define an alternative             graphic symbol for the gate. Two equivalent graphic symbols for the NAND gate are             shown in Fig. 3.17. The AND-invert symbol has been defined previously and consists                    Section 3.6 NAND and NOR Implementation 91    Inverter x                                             x    x                                                      xy    AND y                                      x                    (xy)  x  y                               OR                                      y FIGURE 3.16 Logic operations with NAND gates x                  (xyz)                x                     x  y  z  (xyz) y                                       y z                                       z    (a) AND-invert                          (b) Invert-OR FIGURE 3.17 Two graphic symbols for a three-input NAND gate             of an AND graphic symbol followed by a small circle negation indicator referred to as             a bubble. Alternatively, it is possible to represent a NAND gate by an OR graphic             symbol that is preceded by a bubble in each input. The invert-OR symbol for the             NAND gate follows DeMorgans theorem and the convention that the negation indica-             tor (bubble) denotes complementation. The two graphic symbols representations are             useful in the analysis and design of NAND circuits. When both symbols are mixed in             the same diagram, the circuit is said to be in mixed notation. Two-Level Implementation             The implementation of Boolean functions with NAND gates requires that the functions             be in sum-of-products form. To see the relationship between a sum-of-products expres-             sion and its equivalent NAND implementation, consider the logic diagrams drawn in             Fig. 3.18. All three diagrams are equivalent and implement the function                                                           F = AB + CD             The function is implemented in Fig. 3.18(a) with AND and OR gates. In Fig. 3.18(b), the             AND gates are replaced by NAND gates and the OR gate is replaced by a NAND gate             with an OR-invert graphic symbol. Remember that a bubble denotes complementation             and two bubbles along the same line represent double complementation, so both can be             removed. Removing the bubbles on the gates of (b) produces the circuit of (a). Therefore,             the two diagrams implement the same function and are equivalent.         A         B                                                                F         C         D                                  (a) A                                        A B                                        B                                       F                                F C                                        C D                                        D    (b)                                                            (c) FIGURE 3.18 Three ways to implement F = AB + CD            In Fig. 3.18(c), the output NAND gate is redrawn with the AND-invert graphic symbol.        In drawing NAND logic diagrams, the circuit shown in either Fig. 3.18(b) or (c) is accept-        able. The one in Fig. 3.18(b) is in mixed notation and represents a more direct relationship        to the Boolean expression it implements. The NAND implementation in Fig. 3.18(c) can        be verified algebraically. The function it implements can easily be converted to sum-of-        products form by DeMorgans theorem:                                          F = ((AB)(CD)) = AB + CD EXAMPLE 3.9        Implement the following Boolean function with NAND gates:                                              F (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7)        The first step is to simplify the function into sum-of-products form. This is done by        means of the map of Fig. 3.19(a), from which the simplified function is obtained:                                                    F = xy + xy + z        The two-level NAND implementation is shown in Fig. 3.19(b) in mixed notation. Note        that input z must have a one-input NAND gate (an inverter) to compensate for the        bubble in the second-level gate. An alternative way of drawing the logic diagram is given        in Fig. 3.19(c). Here, all the NAND gates are drawn with the same graphic symbol. The        inverter with input z has been removed, but the input variable is complemented and        denoted by z.

The procedure for obtaining the logic diagram from a Boolean function is as follows:    1. Simplify the function and express it in sum-of-products form.    2. Draw a NAND gate for each product term of the expression that has at least two        literals. The inputs to each NAND gate are the literals of the term. This procedure        produces a group of first-level gates.    3. Draw a single gate using the AND-invert or the invert-OR graphic symbol in the        second level, with inputs coming from outputs of first-level gates.    4. A term with a single literal requires an inverter in the first level. However, if the        single literal is complemented, it can be connected directly to an input of the second-        level NAND gate. Multilevel NAND Circuits             The standard form of expressing Boolean functions results in a two-level implementation.             There are occasions, however, when the design of digital systems results in gating structures             with three or more levels. The most common procedure in the design of multilevel circuits             is to express the Boolean function in terms of AND, OR, and complement operations. The             function can then be implemented with AND and OR gates. After that, if necessary, it can             be converted into an all-NAND circuit. Consider, for example, the Boolean function                                                     F = A (CD + B) + BC                   C                   D                   B                   A                                                                                                                                                         F                   B                   C                                                                          (a) ANDCOR gates                   C                   D                   B                   A                                                                                                                                                         F                   B                   C                                                                            (b) NAND gates                   FIGURE 3.20                   Implementing F = A(CD + B) + BC             Although it is possible to remove the parentheses and reduce the expression into a standard             sum-of-products form, we choose to implement it as a multilevel circuit for illustration. The             ANDCOR implementation is shown in Fig. 3.20(a). There are four levels of gating in the             circuit. The first level has two AND gates. The second level has an OR gate followed by an             AND gate in the third level and an OR gate in the fourth level. A logic diagram with a pat-             tern of alternating levels of AND and OR gates can easily be converted into a NAND circuit             with the use of mixed notation, shown in Fig. 3.20(b).The procedure is to change every AND             gate to an AND-invert graphic symbol and every OR gate to an invert-OR graphic symbol.             The NAND circuit performs the same logic as the ANDCOR diagram as long as there are             two bubbles along the same line. The bubble associated with input B causes an extra comple-             mentation, which must be compensated for by changing the input literal to B.                 The general procedure for converting a multilevel ANDCOR diagram into an all-NAND             diagram using mixed notation is as follows:                 1. Convert all AND gates to NAND gates with AND-invert graphic symbols.                 2. Convert all OR gates to NAND gates with invert-OR graphic symbols.                 3. Check all the bubbles in the diagram. For every bubble that is not compensated                     by another small circle along the same line, insert an inverter (a one-input NAND                     gate) or complement the input literal.                 As another example, consider the multilevel Boolean function                                                   F = (AB + AB)(C + D)    Section 3.6 NAND and NOR Implementation 95 A B A B                                                             F C D                                        (a) ANDCOR gates A B A B                                                                F       C       D                                               (b) NAND gates FIGURE 3.21 Implementing F = (AB + AB) (C + D) The ANDCOR implementation of this function is shown in Fig. 3.21(a) with three levels of gating. The conversion to NAND with mixed notation is presented in Fig. 3.21(b) of the diagram. The two additional bubbles associated with inputs C and D cause these two literals to be complemented to C and D. The bubble in the output NAND gate complements the output value, so we need to insert an inverter gate at the output in order to complement the signal again and get the original value back. NOR Implementation             The NOR operation is the dual of the NAND operation. Therefore, all procedures and             rules for NOR logic are the duals of the corresponding procedures and rules developed             for NAND logic. The NOR gate is another universal gate that can be used to implement             any Boolean function. The implementation of the complement, OR, and AND operations             with NOR gates is shown in Fig. 3.22. The complement operation is obtained from a one-             input NOR gate that behaves exactly like an inverter. The OR operation requires two NOR             gates, and the AND operation is obtained with a NOR gate that has inverters in each input.                 The two graphic symbols for the mixed notation are shown in Fig. 3.23.The OR-invert             symbol defines the NOR operation as an OR followed by a complement. The invert-AND             symbol complements each input and then performs an AND operation. The two symbols             designate the same NOR operation and are logically identical because of DeMorgans             theorem.

Remember that the simplified product-of-sums expression is obtained from the map by combining the 0s and complementing. A product-of-sums expression is implemented with a first level of OR gates that produce the sum terms followed by a second-level AND gate to produce the product. The transformation from the ORCAND diagram to a NOR diagram is achieved by changing the OR gates to NOR gates with OR-invert graphic symbols and the AND gate to a NOR gate with an invert-AND graphic symbol. A single literal term going into the second-level gate must be complemented. Figure 3.24 shows the NOR implementation of a function expressed as a product of sums:                                         F = (A + B)(C + D)E The ORCAND pattern can easily be detected by the removal of the bubbles along the same line. Variable E is complemented to compensate for the third bubble at the input of the second-level gate.    The procedure for converting a multilevel ANDCOR diagram to an all-NOR diagram is similar to the one presented for NAND gates. For the NOR case, we must convert each OR gate to an OR-invert symbol and each AND gate to an invert-AND symbol. Any bubble that is not compensated by another bubble along the same line needs an inverter, or the complementation of the input literal.    The transformation of the ANDCOR diagram of Fig. 3.21(a) into a NOR diagram is shown in Fig. 3.25. The Boolean function for this circuit is                                      F = (AB + AB)(C + D)                                         Section 3.7 Other Two-Level Implementations 97                                         A                                         B                                         C                                                                                                             F                                         D                                         E          FIGURE 3.24          Implementing F = (A + B)(C + D)E                           A                           B                                                                                                                           F                           A                           B                           C                           D          FIGURE 3.25          Implementing F = (AB + AB)(C + D) with NOR gates      The equivalent ANDCOR diagram can be recognized from the NOR diagram by remov-      ing all the bubbles. To compensate for the bubbles in four inputs, it is necessary to      complement the corresponding input literals. 3.7  OTHER TWO-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATIONS       The types of gates most often found in integrated circuits are NAND and NOR gates.       For this reason, NAND and NOR logic implementations are the most important from       a practical point of view. Some (but not all) NAND or NOR gates allow the possibility       of a wire connection between the outputs of two gates to provide a specific logic func-       tion. This type of logic is called wired logic. For example, open-collector TTL NAND       gates, when tied together, perform wired-AND logic. The wired-AND logic performed       with two NAND gates is depicted in Fig. 3.26(a). The AND gate is drawn with the lines       going through the center of the gate to distinguish it from a conventional gate. The       wired-AND gate is not a physical gate, but only a symbol to designate the function       obtained from the indicated wired connection. The logic function implemented by the       circuit of Fig. 3.26(a) is                     F = (AB) c (CD) = (AB + CD) = (A + B)(C + D)       and is called an ANDCORCINVERT function. A                                               A B                                               B                                    F  (AB  CD)                                  F  [(A  B) (C  D)] C                                               C D                                               D   (a) Wired-AND in open-collector                    (b) Wired-OR in ECL gates             TTL NAND gates.

The logic function implemented by the circuit of Fig. 3.26(b) is                        F = (A + B) + (C + D) = 3(A + B)(C + D) 4    and is called an ORCANDCINVERT function.       A wired-logic gate does not produce a physical second-level gate, since it is just a wire    connection. Nevertheless, for discussion purposes, we will consider the circuits of Fig. 3.26    as two-level implementations. The first level consists of NAND (or NOR) gates and the    second level has a single AND (or OR) gate. The wired connection in the graphic symbol    will be omitted in subsequent discussions. Nondegenerate Forms             It will be instructive from a theoretical point of view to find out how many two-level com-             binations of gates are possible. We consider four types of gates: AND, OR, NAND, and             NOR. If we assign one type of gate for the first level and one type for the second level, we             find that there are 16 possible combinations of two-level forms. (The same type of gate can             be in the first and second levels, as in a NANDCNAND implementation.) Eight of these             combinations are said to be degenerate forms because they degenerate to a single opera-             tion. This can be seen from a circuit with AND gates in the first level and an AND gate in             the second level. The output of the circuit is merely the AND function of all input variables.             The remaining eight nondegenerate forms produce an implementation in sum-of-products             form or product-of-sums form. The eight nondegenerate forms are as follows:                                    ANDCOR         ORCAND                                    NANDCNAND      NORCNOR                                    NORCOR         NANDCAND                                    ORCNAND        ANDCNOR                                                 Section 3.7 Other Two-Level Implementations 99             The first gate listed in each of the forms constitutes a first level in the implementation.             The second gate listed is a single gate placed in the second level. Note that any two forms             listed on the same line are duals of each other.                 The ANDCOR and ORCAND forms are the basic two-level forms discussed in             Section 3.4. The NANDCNAND and NORCNOR forms were presented in Section 3.5.             The remaining four forms are investigated in this section. ANDCORCINVERT Implementation             The two forms, NANDCAND and ANDCNOR, are equivalent and can be treated             together. Both perform the ANDCORCINVERT function, as shown in Fig. 3.27. The             ANDCNOR form resembles the ANDCOR form, but with an inversion done by the             bubble in the output of the NOR gate. It implements the function                                                      F = (AB + CD + E)                 By using the alternative graphic symbol for the NOR gate, we obtain the diagram of             Fig. 3.27(b). Note that the single variable E is not complemented, because the only             change made is in the graphic symbol of the NOR gate. Now we move the bubble from             the input terminal of the second-level gate to the output terminals of the first-level gates.             An inverter is needed for the single variable in order to compensate for the bubble.             Alternatively, the inverter can be removed, provided that input E is complemented. The             circuit of Fig. 3.27(c) is a NANDCAND form and was shown in Fig. 3.26 to implement             the ANDCORCINVERT function.                 An ANDCOR implementation requires an expression in sum-of-products form. The             ANDCORCINVERT implementation is similar, except for the inversion. Therefore, if the             complement of the function is simplified into sum-of-products form (by combining the 0s             in the map), it will be possible to implement F with the ANDCOR part of the function.             When F passes through the always present output inversion (the INVERT part), it will A                   A                               A B                   B                               B C                   C                               C                  F  D                            F  D                 F D E                   E                               E    (a) ANDCNOR        (b) ANDCNOR                    (c) NANDCAND    FIGURE 3.27    ANDCORCINVERT circuits, F = (AB + CD + E )             generate the output F of the function. An example for the ANDCORCINVERT imple-             mentation will be shown subsequently. ORCANDCINVERT Implementation             The ORCNAND and NORCOR forms perform the ORCANDCINVERT function, as             shown in Fig. 3.28. The ORCNAND form resembles the ORCAND form, except for the             inversion done by the bubble in the NAND gate. It implements the function                                               F = 3(A + B)(C + D)E4                 By using the alternative graphic symbol for the NAND gate, we obtain the diagram             of Fig. 3.28(b).The circuit in Fig. 3.28(c) is obtained by moving the small circles from the             inputs of the second-level gate to the outputs of the first-level gates. The circuit of Fig.             3.28(c) is a NORCOR form and was shown in Fig. 3.26 to implement the ORCANDC             INVERT function.                 The ORCANDCINVERT implementation requires an expression in product-of-sums             form. If the complement of the function is simplified into that form, we can implement             F with the ORCAND part of the function. When F passes through the INVERT part,             we obtain the complement of F, or F, in the output. Tabular Summary and Example             Table 3.2 summarizes the procedures for implementing a Boolean function in any one             of the four 2-level forms. Because of the INVERT part in each case, it is convenient to             use the simplification of F (the complement) of the function. When F is implemented             in one of these forms, we obtain the complement of the function in the ANDCOR or             ORCAND form. The four 2-level forms invert this function, giving an output that is the             complement of F. This is the normal output F.

EXAMPLE 3.10        Implement the function of Fig. 3.29(a) with the four 2-level forms listed in Table 3.2.        The complement of the function is simplified into sum-of-products form by combining        the 0s in the map:                                                   F = xy + xy + z        The normal output for this function can be expressed as                                                  F = (xy + xy + z)        which is in the ANDCORCINVERT form. The ANDCNOR and NANDCAND imple-        mentations are shown in Fig. 3.29(b). Note that a one-input NAND, or inverter, gate is        needed in the NANDCAND implementation, but not in the ANDCNOR case. The        inverter can be removed if we apply the input variable z instead of z.            The ORCANDCINVERT forms require a simplified expression of the complement        of the function in product-of-sums form. To obtain this expression, we first combine the        1s in the map:                                                    F = xyz + xyz        Then we take the complement of the function:                                            F = (x + y + z)(x + y + z) 102  Chapter 3 Gate-Level Minimization            yz                                      y         x                          00    01    11    10                m0                      m1    m3    m2         F = xyz + xyz                                                               F = xy + xy + z            01                             0     0     0                                                          xyz         xyz                            m5    m7    m6                                m4         0     0     1         x1 0                                 z                (a) Map simplification in sum of products      x                                                x      y                                                y      x                                                x      y                                       F        y                        F      z                                                z         ANDCNOR                       (b) F  (xy  xy  z) NANDCAND      x                                                x      y                                                y      z                                                z                                              F                                 F      x                                                x      y                                                y      z                                                z         ORCNAND                                         NORCOR                                    (c) F  [(x  y  z) (x  y  z)]      FIGURE 3.29      Other two-level implementations      The normal output F can now be expressed in the form                                    F = 3(x + y + z)(x + y + z) 4      which is the ORCANDCINVERT form. From this expression, we can implement the      function in the ORCNAND and NORCOR forms, as shown in Fig. 3.29(c).                                                                                                                     3.8                                                      Section 3.8 Exclusive-OR Function 103      EXCLUSIVE-OR FUNCTION       The exclusive-OR (XOR), denoted by the symbol {, is a logical operation that performs       the following Boolean operation:                                                  x { y = xy + xy       The exclusive-OR is equal to 1 if only x is equal to 1 or if only y is equal to 1 (i.e., x and y       differ in value), but not when both are equal to 1 or when both are equal to 0. The exclusive-       NOR, also known as equivalence, performs the following Boolean operation:                                                 (x { y) = xy + xy       The exclusive-NOR is equal to 1 if both x and y are equal to 1 or if both are equal to 0.       The exclusive-NOR can be shown to be the complement of the exclusive-OR by means       of a truth table or by algebraic manipulation:                         (x { y) = (xy + xy) = (x + y)(x + y) = xy + xy          The following identities apply to the exclusive-OR operation:                                                       x{0 = x                                                       x { 1 = x                                                       x{x = 0                                                       x { x = 1                                                       x { y = x { y = (x { y)       Any of these identities can be proven with a truth table or by replacing the { operation       by its equivalent Boolean expression. Also, it can be shown that the exclusive-OR oper-       ation is both commutative and associative; that is,                                                    A{B = B{A       and                                (A { B) { C = A { (B { C) = A { B { C       This means that the two inputs to an exclusive-OR gate can be interchanged without       affecting the operation. It also means that we can evaluate a three-variable exclusive-OR       operation in any order, and for this reason, three or more variables can be expressed       without parentheses. This would imply the possibility of using exclusive-OR gates with       three or more inputs. However, multiple-input exclusive-OR gates are difficult to fabri-       cate with hardware. In fact, even a two-input function is usually constructed with other       types of gates. A two-input exclusive-OR function is constructed with conventional gates       using two inverters, two AND gates, and an OR gate, as shown in Fig. 3.30(a). Figure 3.30(b)       shows the implementation of the exclusive-OR with four NAND gates. The first NAND       gate performs the operation (xy) = (x + y). The other two-level NAND circuit       produces the sum of products of its inputs:                                (x + y)x + (x + y)y = xy + xy = x { y                                     x                                                                                                                                 xy                                     y                                                        (a) Exclusive-OR with ANDCORCNOT gates                                     x                                                                                                                                 xy                                     y                                                               (b) Exclusive-OR with NAND gates                   FIGURE 3.30                   Exclusive-OR implementations                 Only a limited number of Boolean functions can be expressed in terms of exclusive-OR             operations. Nevertheless, this function emerges quite often during the design of digital             systems. It is particularly useful in arithmetic operations and error detection and correc-             tion circuits. Odd Function             The exclusive-OR operation with three or more variables can be converted into an             ordinary Boolean function by replacing the { symbol with its equivalent Boolean             expression. In particular, the three-variable case can be converted to a Boolean expres-             sion as follows:                                      A { B { C = (AB + AB)C + (AB + AB)C                                                     = ABC + ABC + ABC + ABC                                                     = (1, 2, 4, 7)             The Boolean expression clearly indicates that the three-variable exclusive-OR function is             equal to 1 if only one variable is equal to 1 or if all three variables are equal to 1. Contrary             to the two-variable case, in which only one variable must be equal to 1, in the case of three             or more variables the requirement is that an odd number of variables be equal to 1. As a             consequence, the multiple-variable exclusive-OR operation is defined as an odd function.                                                    Section 3.8 Exclusive-OR Function 105    The Boolean function derived from the three-variable exclusive-OR operation is expressed as the logical sum of four minterms whose binary numerical values are 001, 010, 100, and 111. Each of these binary numbers has an odd number of 1s.The remaining four minterms not included in the function are 000, 011, 101, and 110, and they have an even number of 1s in their binary numerical values. In general, an n-variable exclusive-OR function is an odd function defined as the logical sum of the 2n>2 minterms whose binary numerical values have an odd number of 1s.    The definition of an odd function can be clarified by plotting it in a map. Figure 3.31(a) shows the map for the three-variable exclusive-OR function. The four minterms of the function are a unit distance apart from each other. The odd function is identified from the four minterms whose binary values have an odd number of 1s. The complement of an odd function is an even function. As shown in Fig. 3.31(b), the three-variable even function is equal to 1 when an even number of its variables is equal to 1 (including the condition that none of the variables is equal to 1).    The three-input odd function is implemented by means of two-input exclusive-OR gates, as shown in Fig. 3.32(a).The complement of an odd function is obtained by replac- ing the output gate with an exclusive-NOR gate, as shown in Fig. 3.32(b).    Consider now the four-variable exclusive-OR operation. By algebraic manipulation, we can obtain the sum of minterms for this function:        A { B { C { D = (AB + AB) { (CD + CD)                              = (AB + AB)(CD + CD) + (AB + AB)(CD + CD)                              = (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14)       BC                            B           BC                       B    A          00     01    11         10  A              00    01    11    10           m0       m1    m3         m2              m0       m1    m3    m2       0               1                1        01           m5      1                m4  m5    m7         m6               m4         1  m7    m6    A1 1                      1            A1                                 1                           C                                            C       (a) Odd function F  A  B  C               (b) Even function F  (A  B  C) FIGURE 3.31 Map for a three-variable exclusive-OR function A                                               A B                                               B C                                               C           (a) 3-input odd function                        (b) 3-input even function FIGURE 3.32 Logic diagram of odd and even functions 106  Chapter 3 Gate-Level Minimization             CD                       C                  CD                            C         AB      00       01     11        10        AB            00    01      11      10                    m0  m1     m3        m2                  m0        m1      m3      m2             00            1                1            00 1                     1                 m4     m5     m7        m6                    m4      m5      m7      m6             01 1                  1                     01                 1             1                 B m12                                       B m12                        m13    m15    m14                              m13     m15     m14             11             1                1           11 1                       1      A          m8     m9     m11       m10         A       m         m9      m11     m10                                                              8                           1             10 1                  1                     10                 1                                   D                                              D           (a) Odd function F  A  B  C  D               (b) Even function F  (A  B  C  D)      FIGURE 3.33      Map for a four-variable exclusive-OR function                 There are 16 minterms for a four-variable Boolean function. Half of the minterms             have binary numerical values with an odd number of 1s; the other half of the minterms             have binary numerical values with an even number of 1s. In plotting the function in the             map, the binary numerical value for a minterm is determined from the row and column             numbers of the square that represents the minterm. The map of Fig. 3.33(a) is a plot of             the four-variable exclusive-OR function. This is an odd function because the binary             values of all the minterms have an odd number of 1s. The complement of an odd func-             tion is an even function.As shown in Fig. 3.33(b), the four-variable even function is equal             to 1 when an even number of its variables is equal to 1. Parity Generation and Checking             Exclusive-OR functions are very useful in systems requiring error detection and cor-             rection codes. As discussed in Section 1.6, a parity bit is used for the purpose of             detecting errors during the transmission of binary information. A parity bit is an extra             bit included with a binary message to make the number of 1s either odd or even. The             message, including the parity bit, is transmitted and then checked at the receiving end             for errors. An error is detected if the checked parity does not correspond with the             one transmitted. The circuit that generates the parity bit in the transmitter is called             a parity generator. The circuit that checks the parity in the receiver is called a parity             checker.                 As an example, consider a three-bit message to be transmitted together with an             even-parity bit. Table 3.3 shows the truth table for the parity generator. The three             bitsx, y, and zconstitute the message and are the inputs to the circuit. The parity             bit P is the output. For even parity, the bit P must be generated to make the total             number of 1s (including P) even. From the truth table, we see that P constitutes an                                             Section 3.8 Exclusive-OR Function 107    Table 3.3    Even-Parity-Generator Truth Table    Three-Bit Message                              Parity Bit    x  y                                     z     P    0  0                                     0     0    0  0                                     1     1    0  1                                     0     1    0  1                                     1     0    1  0                                     0     1    1  0                                     1     0    1  1                                     0     0    1  1                                     1     1                                                x x                                              y y                                        P                                              C                                                z z                                              P         (a) 3-bit even parity generator                  (b) 4-bit even parity checker FIGURE 3.34 Logic diagram of a parity generator and checker odd function because it is equal to 1 for those minterms whose numerical values have an odd number of 1s. Therefore, P can be expressed as a three-variable exclusive-OR function:                                      P = x{y{z The logic diagram for the parity generator is shown in Fig. 3.34(a).    The three bits in the message, together with the parity bit, are transmitted to their destination, where they are applied to a parity-checker circuit to check for possible errors in the transmission. Since the information was transmitted with even parity, the four bits received must have an even number of 1s. An error occurs during the trans- mission if the four bits received have an odd number of 1s, indicating that one bit has changed in value during transmission. The output of the parity checker, denoted by C, will be equal to 1 if an error occursthat is, if the four bits received have an odd number of 1s. Table 3.4 is the truth table for the even-parity checker. From it, we see that the function C consists of the eight minterms with binary numerical values hav- ing an odd number of 1s.

The parity checker can be implemented with exclusive-      OR gates:                                                C = x{y{z{P      The logic diagram of the parity checker is shown in Fig. 3.34(b).         It is worth noting that the parity generator can be implemented with the circuit of      Fig. 3.34(b) if the input P is connected to logic 0 and the output is marked with P. This is      because z { 0 = z, causing the value of z to pass through the gate unchanged.The advan-      tage of this strategy is that the same circuit can be used for both parity generation and      checking.         It is obvious from the foregoing example that parity generation and checking circuits      always have an output function that includes half of the minterms whose numerical values      have either an odd or even number of 1s. As a consequence, they can be implemented      with exclusive-OR gates. A function with an even number of 1s is the complement of an      odd function. It is implemented with exclusive-OR gates, except that the gate associated      with the output must be an exclusive-NOR to provide the required complementation. 3.9  HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE       Manual methods for designing logic circuits are feasible only when the circuit is small.       For anything else (i.e., a practical circuit), designers use computer-based design tools.       Coupled with the correct-by-construction methodology, computer-based design tools                                     Section 3.9 Hardware Description Language 109 leverage the creativity and the effort of a designer and reduce the risk of producing a flawed design. Prototype integrated circuits are too expensive and time consuming to build, so all modern design tools rely on a hardware description language to describe, design, and test a circuit in software before it is ever manufactured.    A hardware description language (HDL) is a computer-based language that describes the hardware of digital systems in a textual form. It resembles an ordinary computer programming language, such as C, but is specifically oriented to describing hardware structures and the behavior of logic circuits. It can be used to represent logic diagrams, truth tables, Boolean expressions, and complex abstractions of the behavior of a digital system. One way to view an HDL is to observe that it describes a relationship between signals that are the inputs to a circuit and the signals that are the outputs of the circuit. For example, an HDL description of an AND gate describes how the logic value of the gates output is determined by the logic values of its inputs.    As a documentation language, an HDL is used to represent and document digital systems in a form that can be read by both humans and computers and is suitable as an exchange language between designers. The language content can be stored, retrieved, edited, and transmitted easily and processed by computer software in an efficient manner.    HDLs are used in several major steps in the design flow of an integrated circuit: design entry, functional simulation or verification, logic synthesis, timing verification, and fault simulation.    Design entry creates an HDL-based description of the functionality that is to be implemented in hardware. Depending on the HDL, the description can be in a variety of forms: Boolean logic equations, truth tables, a netlist of interconnected gates, or an abstract behavioral model. The HDL model may also represent a partition of a larger circuit into smaller interconnected and interacting functional units.    Logic simulation displays the behavior of a digital system through the use of a com- puter. A simulator interprets the HDL description and either produces readable output, such as a time-ordered sequence of input and output signal values, or displays wave- forms of the signals. The simulation of a circuit predicts how the hardware will behave before it is actually fabricated. Simulation detects functional errors in a design without having to physically create and operate the circuit. Errors that are detected during a simulation can be corrected by modifying the appropriate HDL statements. The stimu- lus (i.e., the logic values of the inputs to a circuit) that tests the functionality of the design is called a test bench. Thus, to simulate a digital system, the design is first described in an HDL and then verified by simulating the design and checking it with a test bench, which is also written in the HDL. An alternative and more complex approach relies on formal mathematical methods to prove that a circuit is functionally correct. We will focus exclusively on simulation.    Logic synthesis is the process of deriving a list of physical components and their interconnections (called a netlist) from the model of a digital system described in an HDL. The netlist can be used to fabricate an integrated circuit or to lay out a printed circuit board with the hardware counterparts of the gates in the list. Logic synthesis is similar to compiling a program in a conventional high-level language. The difference is             that, instead of producing an object code, logic synthesis produces a database describing             the elements and structure of a circuit. The database specifies how to fabricate a physi-             cal integrated circuit that implements in silicon the functionality described by statements             made in an HDL. Logic synthesis is based on formal exact procedures that implement             digital circuits and addresses that part of a digital design which can be automated with             computer software. The design of todays large, complex circuits is made possible by             logic synthesis software.                 Timing verification confirms that the fabricated, integrated circuit will operate at a             specified speed. Because each logic gate in a circuit has a propagation delay, a signal             transition at the input of a circuit cannot immediately cause a change in the logic value             of the output of a circuit. Propagation delays ultimately limit the speed at which             a circuit can operate. Timing verification checks each signal path to verify that it is             not compromised by propagation delay. This step is done after logic synthesis specifies             the actual devices that will compose a circuit and before the circuit is released for             production.                 In VLSI circuit design, fault simulation compares the behavior of an ideal circuit with             the behavior of a circuit that contains a process-induced flaw. Dust and other particu-             lates in the atmosphere of the clean room can cause a circuit to be fabricated with a             fault. A circuit with a fault will not exhibit the same functionality as a fault-free circuit.             Fault simulation is used to identify input stimuli that can be used to reveal the difference             between the faulty circuit and the fault-free circuit. These test patterns will be used to             test fabricated devices to ensure that only good devices are shipped to the customer.             Test generation and fault simulation may occur at different steps in the design process,             but they are always done before production in order to avoid the disaster of producing             a circuit whose internal logic cannot be tested.                 Companies that design integrated circuits use proprietary and public HDLs. In the             public domain, there are two standard HDLs that are supported by the IEEE: VHDL             and Verilog. VHDL is a Department of DefenseCmandated language. (The V in VHDL             stands for the first letter in VHSIC, an acronym for very high-speed integrated circuit.)             Verilog began as a proprietary HDL of Cadence Design Systems, but Cadence trans-             ferred control of Verilog to a consortium of companies and universities known as Open             Verilog International (OVI) as a step leading to its adoption as an IEEE standard.             VHDL is more difficult to learn than Verilog. Because Verilog is an easier language than             VHDL to describe, learn, and use, we have chosen it for this book. However, the Verilog             HDL descriptions listed throughout the book are not just about Verilog, but also serve             to introduce a design methodology based on the concept of computer-aided modeling             of digital systems by means of a typical hardware description language. Our emphasis             will be on the modeling, verification, and synthesis (both manual and automated) of             Verilog models of circuits having specified behavior. The Verilog HDL was initially             approved as a standard HDL in 1995; revised and enhanced versions of the language             were approved in 2001 and 2005. We will address only those features of Verilog, includ-             ing the latest standard, that support our discussion of HDL-based design methodology             for integrated circuits.                                                  Section 3.9 Hardware Description Language 111 Module Declaration             The language reference manual for the Verilog HDL presents a syntax that describes             precisely the constructs that can be used in the language. In particular, a Verilog             model is composed of text using keywords, of which there are about 100. Keywords             are predefined lowercase identifiers that define the language constructs. Examples of             keywords are module, endmodule, input, output, wire, and, or, and not. For clarity,             keywords will be displayed in boldface in the text in all examples of code and wher-             ever it is appropriate to call attention to their use. Any text between two forward             slashes (// ) and the end of the line is interpreted as a comment and will have no effect             on a simulation using the model. Multiline comments begin with /* and terminate             with */. Blank spaces are ignored, but they may not appear within the text of a key-             word, a user-specified identifier, an operator, or the representation of a number. Ver-             ilog is case sensitive, which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are             distinguishable (e.g., not is not the same as NOT). The term module refers to the text             enclosed by the keyword pair module . . . endmodule. A module is the fundamental             descriptive unit in the Verilog language. It is declared by the keyword module and             must always be terminated by the keyword endmodule.                 Combinational logic can be described by a schematic connection of gates, by a set of             Boolean equations, or by a truth table. Each type of description can be developed in             Verilog. We will demonstrate each style, beginning with a simple example of a Verilog             gate-level description to illustrate some aspects of the language.                 The HDL description of the circuit of Fig. 3.35 is shown in HDL Example 3.1. The             first line of text is a comment (optional) providing useful information to the reader. The             second line begins with the keyword module and starts the declaration (description) of             the module; the last line completes the declaration with the keyword endmodule. The             keyword module is followed by a name and a list of ports. The name (Simple_Circuit in             this example) is an identifier. Identifiers are names given to modules, variables (e.g., a             signal), and other elements of the language so that they can be referenced in the design.             In general, we choose meaningful names for modules. Identifiers are composed of alpha-             numeric characters and the underscore (_), and are case sensitive. Identifiers must start             with an alphabetic character or an underscore, but they cannot start with a number.

IEEE 1364C1995 Syntax module Simple_Circuit (A, B, C, D, E); output     D, E; input      A, B, C; wire       w1;  and       G1 (w1, A, B); // Optional gate instance name  not       G2 (E, C);  or        G3 (D, w1, E); endmodule    The port list of a module is the interface between the module and its environment. In this example, the ports are the inputs and outputs of the circuit. The logic values of the inputs to a circuit are determined by the environment; the logic values of the outputs are determined within the circuit and result from the action of the inputs on the circuit. The port list is enclosed in parentheses, and commas are used to separate elements of the list. The statement is terminated with a semicolon (;). In our examples, all keywords (which must be in lowercase) are printed in bold for clarity, but that is not a requirement of the language. Next, the keywords input and output specify which of the ports are inputs and which are outputs. Internal connections are declared as wires. The circuit in this example has one internal connection, at terminal w1, and is declared with the key- word wire. The structure of the circuit is specified by a list of (predefined) primitive gates, each identified by a descriptive keyword (and, not, or). The elements of the list are referred to as instantiations of a gate, each of which is referred to as a gate instance. Each gate instantiation consists of an optional name (such as G1, G2, etc.) followed by the gate output and inputs separated by commas and enclosed within parentheses. The output of a primitive gate is always listed first, followed by the inputs. For example, the OR gate of the schematic is represented by the or primitive, is named G3, and has out- put D and inputs w1 and E. (Note: The output of a primitive must be listed first, but the inputs and outputs of a module may be listed in any order.) The module description ends with the keyword endmodule. Each statement must be terminated with a semicolon, but there is no semicolon after endmodule.    It is important to understand the distinction between the terms declaration and instan- tiation.A Verilog module is declared. Its declaration specifies the inputCoutput behavior of the hardware that it represents. Predefined primitives are not declared, because their definition is specified by the language and is not subject to change by the user. Primitives are used (i.e., instantiated), just as gates are used to populate a printed circuit board. Well see that once a module has been declared, it may be used (instantiated) within a design. Note that Simple_Circuit is not a computational model like those developed in an ordinary programming language: The sequential ordering of the statements instanti- ating gates in the model has no significance and does not specify a sequence of compu- tations. A Verilog model is a descriptive model. Simple_Circuit describes what primitives form a circuit and how they are connected. The inputCoutput behavior of the circuit is          Section 3.9 Hardware Description Language 113 Table 3.5 Output of Gates after Delay          Time Units          Input  Output               (ns)            ABC                                     E w1 D Initial                    0 0 0                              1 1 1  1 01 Change                     1 1 1  1 01                              1 1 1  0 01          10                  1 1 1  0 01                              1 1 1  0 10          20                  1 1 1  0 10                                     0 11          30          40          50             implicitly specified by the description because the behavior of each logic gate is defined.             Thus, an HDL-based model can be used to simulate the circuit that it represents. Gate Delays             All physical circuits exhibit a propagation delay between the transition of an input and a             resulting transition of an output. When an HDL model of a circuit is simulated, it is some-             times necessary to specify the amount of delay from the input to the output of its gates.             In Verilog, the propagation delay of a gate is specified in terms of time units and by the             symbol #. The numbers associated with time delays in Verilog are dimensionless. The             association of a time unit with physical time is made with the timescale compiler direc-             tive. (Compiler directives start with the () back quote, or grave accent, symbol.) Such a             directive is specified before the declaration of a module and applies to all numerical             values of time in the code that follows. An example of a timescale directive is                                                       timescale 1ns/100ps             The first number specifies the unit of measurement for time delays. The second number             specifies the precision for which the delays are rounded off, in this case to 0.1 ns. If no             timescale is specified, a simulator may display dimensionless values or default to a certain             time unit, usually 1 ns ( =10-9 s). Our examples will use only the default time unit.                 HDL Example 3.2 repeats the description of the simple circuit of Example 3.1, but             with propagation delays specified for each gate. The and, or, and not gates have a time             delay of 30, 20, and 10 ns, respectively. If the circuit is simulated and the inputs change             from A, B, C = 0 to A, B, C = 1, the outputs change as shown in Table 3.5 (calculated             by hand or generated by a simulator). The output of the inverter at E changes from 1 to             0 after a 10-ns delay. The output of the AND gate at w1 changes from 0 to 1 after a 30-ns             delay.The output of the OR gate at D changes from 1 to 0 at t = 30 ns and then changes             back to 1 at t = 50 ns. In both cases, the change in the output of the OR gate results             from a change in its inputs 20 ns earlier. It is clear from this result that although output             D eventually returns to a final value of 1 after the input changes, the gate delays produce             a negative spike that lasts 20 ns before the final value is reached.

An HDL description that provides the stimulus to a design is called a test bench. The writing of test benches is explained in more detail at the end of Section 4.12. Here, we demonstrate the procedure with a simple example without dwelling on too many details. HDL Example 3.3 shows a test bench for simulating the circuit with delay. (Note the distinguishing name Simple_Circuit_prop_ delay.) In its simplest form, a test bench is a module containing a signal generator and an instantiation of the model that is to be verified. Note that the test bench (t_Simple_ Circuit_prop_delay) has no input or output ports, because it does not interact with its environment. In general, we prefer to name the test bench with the prefix t_ concatenated with the name of the module that is to be tested by the test bench, but that choice is left to the designer. Within the test bench, the inputs to the circuit are declared with keyword reg and the outputs are declared with the keyword wire. The module Simple_Circuit_ prop_delay is instantiated with the instance name M1. Every instantiation of a module must include a unique instance name. Note that using a test bench is similar to testing actual hardware by attaching signal generators to the inputs of a circuit and attaching          HDL Example 3.3 (Test Bench)          // Test bench for Simple_Circuit_prop_delay          module t_Simple_Circuit_prop_delay;            wire D, E;            reg A, B, C;          Simple_Circuit_prop_delay M1 (A, B, C, D, E); // Instance name required          initial            begin              A = 1\\'b0; B = 1\\'b0; C = 1\\'b0;              #100 A = 1\\'b1; B = 1\\'b1; C = 1\\'b1;            end            initial #200 $finish;          endmodule                 Section 3.9 Hardware Description Language 115    Name 0.0 ns  58.0 ns               116.0 ns  174.0 ns A B C D E FIGURE 3.36 Simulation output of HDL Example 3.3             probes (wires) to the outputs of the circuit. (The interaction between the signal genera-             tors of the stimulus module and the instantiated circuit module is illustrated in Fig. 4.36.)                 Hardware signal generators are not used to verify an HDL model: The entire simula-             tion exercise is done with software models executing on a digital computer under the             direction of an HDL simulator. The waveforms of the input signals are abstractly modeled             (generated) by Verilog statements specifying waveform values and transitions. The initial             keyword is used with a set of statements that begin executing when the simulation is ini-             tialized; the signal activity associated with initial terminates execution when the last state-             ment has finished executing. The initial statements are commonly used to describe             waveforms in a test bench. The set of statements to be executed is called a block statement             and consists of several statements enclosed by the keywords begin and end. The action             specified by the statements begins when the simulation is launched, and the statements             are executed in sequence, left to right, from top to bottom, by a simulator in order to             provide the input to the circuit. Initially, A, B, C = 0. (A, B, and C are each set to 1b0,             which signifies one binary digit with a value of 0.) After 100 ns, the inputs change to             A, B, C = 1. After another 100 ns, the simulation terminates at time 200 ns. A second             initial statement uses the $finish system task to specify termination of the simulation. If a             statement is preceded by a delay value (e.g., #100), the simulator postpones executing the             statement until the specified time delay has elapsed. The timing diagram of waveforms             that result from the simulation is shown in Figure 3.36. The total simulation generates             waveforms over an interval of 200 ns.The inputs A, B, and C change from 0 to 1 after 100             ns. Output E is unknown for the first 10 ns (denoted by shading), and output D is unknown             for the first 30 ns. Output E goes from 1 to 0 at 110 ns. Output D goes from 1 to 0 at 130             ns and back to 1 at 150 ns, just as we predicted in Table 3.5. Boolean Expressions             Boolean equations describing combinational logic are specified in Verilog with a con-             tinuous assignment statement consisting of the keyword assign followed by a Boolean             expression. To distinguish arithmetic operators from logical operators, Verilog uses the             symbols (&), (/), and (&) for AND, OR, and NOT (complement), respectively. Thus, to             describe the simple circuit of Fig. 3.35 with a Boolean expression, we use the statement                                                  assign D = (A && B)   (!C);             HDL Example 3.4 describes a circuit that is specified with the following two Boolean             expressions:                                                       E = A + BC + BD                                                       F = BC + BCD             The equations specify how the logic values E and F are determined by the values of             A, B, C, and D. HDL Example 3.4 (Combinational Logic Modeled with Boolean Equations) // Verilog model: Circuit with Boolean expressions module Circuit_Boolean_CA (E, F, A, B, C, D); output  E, F; input   A, B, C, D;  assign E  A || (B && C) || ((!B) && D);  assign F  ((!B) && C) || (B && (!C) && (!D)); endmodule                 The circuit has two outputs E and F and four inputs A, B, C, and D. The two assign             statements describe the Boolean equations. The values of E and F during simulation are             determined dynamically by the values of A, B, C, and D.The simulator detects when the             test bench changes a value of one or more of the inputs. When this happens, the simula-             tor updates the values of E and F. The continuous assignment mechanism is so named             because the relationship between the assigned value and the variables is permanent. The             mechanism acts just like combinational logic, has a gate-level equivalent circuit, and is             referred to as implicit combinational logic.                 We have shown that a digital circuit can be described with HDL statements, just as             it can be drawn in a circuit diagram or specified with a Boolean expression. A third             alternative is to describe combinational logic with a truth table. User-Defined Primitives             The logic gates used in Verilog descriptions with keywords and, or, etc., are defined by             the system and are referred to as system primitives. (Caution: Other languages may use             these words differently.) The user can create additional primitives by defining them in             tabular form. These types of circuits are referred to as user-defined primitives (UDPs).             One way of specifying a digital circuit in tabular form is by means of a truth table. UDP             descriptions do not use the keyword pair module . . . endmodule. Instead, they are             declared with the keyword pair primitive . . . endprimitive. The best way to demonstrate             a UDP declaration is by means of an example.                                     Section 3.9 Hardware Description Language 117    HDL Example 3.5 defines a UDP with a truth table. It proceeds according to the following general rules:     It is declared with the keyword primitive, followed by a name and port list.     There can be only one output, and it must be listed rst in the port list and declared       with keyword output.     There can be any number of inputs. The order in which they are listed in the input       declaration must conform to the order in which they are given values in the table that       follows.     The truth table is enclosed within the keywords table and endtable.     The values of the inputs are listed in order, ending with a colon (:). The output is al-       ways the last entry in a row and is followed by a semicolon (;).     The declaration of a UDP ends with the keyword endprimitive.

The system recognizes the variables by the order in which they are listed in the input declaration. A user-defined primitive can be instantiated in the construction of other modules (digital circuits), just as the system primitives are used. For example, the declaration                            Circuit _with _UDP_ 02467 (E, F, A, B, C, D); will produce a circuit that implements the hardware shown in Figure 3.37.    Although Verilog HDL uses this kind of description for UDPs only, other HDLs and computer-aided design (CAD) systems use other procedures to specify digital circuits in tabular form. The tables can be processed by CAD software to derive an efficient gate structure of the design. None of Verilogs predefined primitives describes sequential logic. The model of a sequential UDP requires that its output be declared as a reg data type, and that a column be added to the truth table to describe the next state. So the columns are organized as inputs : state : next state.    In this section, we introduced the Verilog HDL and presented simple examples to illustrate alternatives for modeling combinational logic. A more detailed presentation of Verilog HDL can be found in the next chapter. The reader familiar with combina- tional circuits can go directly to Section 4.12 to continue with this subject.

A combinational       circuit consists of logic gates whose outputs at any time are determined from only the       present combination of inputs. A combinational circuit performs an operation that can       be specified logically by a set of Boolean functions. In contrast, sequential circuits       employ storage elements in addition to logic gates. Their outputs are a function of the       inputs and the state of the storage elements. Because the state of the storage elements       is a function of previous inputs, the outputs of a sequential circuit depend not only on       present values of inputs, but also on past inputs, and the circuit behavior must be speci-       fied by a time sequence of inputs and internal states. Sequential circuits are the building       blocks of digital systems and are discussed in Chapters 5 and 8. 4.2  COMBINATIONAL CIRCUITS       A combinational circuit consists of an interconnection of logic gates. Combinational       logic gates react to the values of the signals at their inputs and produce the value of the       output signal, transforming binary information from the given input data to a required       output data. A block diagram of a combinational circuit is shown in Fig. 4.1. The n input       binary variables come from an external source; the m output variables are produced by       the internal combinational logic circuit and go to an external destination. Each input       and output variable exists physically as an analog signal whose values are interpreted       to be a binary signal that represents logic 1 and logic 0. (Note: Logic simulators show       only 0s and 1s, not the actual analog signals.) In many applications, the source and                      125      n inputs ڧڧ               Combinational  ڧڧ m outputs                                         circuit      FIGURE 4.1      Block diagram of combinational circuit      destination are storage registers. If the registers are included with the combinational      gates, then the total circuit must be considered to be a sequential circuit.         For n input variables, there are 2n possible combinations of the binary inputs. For each      possible input combination, there is one possible value for each output variable. Thus, a      combinational circuit can be specified with a truth table that lists the output values for      each combination of input variables. A combinational circuit also can be described by      m Boolean functions, one for each output variable. Each output function is expressed      in terms of the n input variables.         In Chapter 1, we learned about binary numbers and binary codes that represent discrete      quantities of information. The binary variables are represented physically by electric volt-      ages or some other type of signal. The signals can be manipulated in digital logic gates to      perform required functions. In Chapter 2, we introduced Boolean algebra as a way to      express logic functions algebraically. In Chapter 3, we learned how to simplify Boolean      functions to achieve economical (simpler) gate implementations. The purpose of the cur-      rent chapter is to use the knowledge acquired in previous chapters to formulate systematic      analysis and design procedures for combinational circuits. The solution of some typical      examples will provide a useful catalog of elementary functions that are important for the      understanding of digital systems. Well address three tasks: (1) Analyze the behavior of a      given logic circuit, (2) synthesize a circuit that will have a given behavior, and (3) write      hardware description language (HDL) models for some common circuits.         There are several combinational circuits that are employed extensively in the design      of digital systems. These circuits are available in integrated circuits and are classified as      standard components. They perform specific digital functions commonly needed in the      design of digital systems. In this chapter, we introduce the most important standard      combinational circuits, such as adders, subtractors, comparators, decoders, encoders, and      multiplexers. These components are available in integrated circuits as medium-scale      integration (MSI) circuits. They are also used as standard cells in complex very large-      scale integrated (VLSI) circuits such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).      The standard cell functions are interconnected within the VLSI circuit in the same way      that they are used in multiple-IC MSI design. 4.3  ANALYSIS PROCEDURE       The analysis of a combinational circuit requires that we determine the function that the       circuit implements. This task starts with a given logic diagram and culminates with a set       of Boolean functions, a truth table, or, possibly, an explanation of the circuit operation.                                                         Section 4.3 Analysis Procedure 127 If the logic diagram to be analyzed is accompanied by a function name or an explanation of what it is assumed to accomplish, then the analysis problem reduces to a verification of the stated function. The analysis can be performed manually by finding the Boolean functions or truth table or by using a computer simulation program.    The first step in the analysis is to make sure that the given circuit is combinational and not sequential. The diagram of a combinational circuit has logic gates with no feedback paths or memory elements. A feedback path is a connection from the output of one gate to the input of a second gate whose output forms part of the input to the first gate. Feedback paths in a digital circuit define a sequential circuit and must be analyzed by special methods and will not be considered here.    Once the logic diagram is verified to be that of a combinational circuit, one can proceed to obtain the output Boolean functions or the truth table. If the function of the circuit is under investigation, then it is necessary to interpret the operation of the circuit from the derived Boolean functions or truth table. The success of such an investigation is enhanced if one has previous experience and familiarity with a wide variety of digital circuits.    To obtain the output Boolean functions from a logic diagram, we proceed as follows:    1. Label all gate outputs that are a function of input variables with arbitrary symbols        but with meaningful names. Determine the Boolean functions for each gate output.    2. Label the gates that are a function of input variables and previously labeled gates        with other arbitrary symbols. Find the Boolean functions for these gates.    3. Repeat the process outlined in step 2 until the outputs of the circuit are obtained.    4. By repeated substitution of previously defined functions, obtain the output        Boolean functions in terms of input variables.    The analysis of the combinational circuit of Fig. 4.2 illustrates the proposed proce- dure. We note that the circuit has three binary inputsA, B, and Cand two binary outputsF1 and F2. The outputs of various gates are labeled with intermediate symbols. The outputs of gates that are a function only of input variables are T1 and T2. Output F2 can easily be derived from the input variables. The Boolean functions for these three outputs are                                          F2 = AB + AC + BC                                          T1 = A + B + C                                          T2 = ABC Next, we consider outputs of gates that are a function of already defined symbols:                                                T3 = F2T1                                                F1 = T3 + T2 To obtain F1 as a function of A, B, and C, we form a series of substitutions as follows:     F1 = T3 + T2 = F2T1 + ABC = 1AB + AC + BC2  1A + B + C2 + ABC         = 1A + B2 1A + C2 1B + C2 1A + B + C2 + ABC         = 1A + BC2 1AB + AC + BC + BC2 + ABC         = ABC + ABC + ABC + ABC A  T2 B                                                                                                 F1                                                                       T3 C                                                                                                   F2 A  T1 B C                                                                   F2    A    B    A    C    B    C FIGURE 4.2 Logic diagram for analysis example    If we want to pursue the investigation and determine the information transformation task achieved by this circuit, we can draw the circuit from the derived Boolean expres- sions and try to recognize a familiar operation. The Boolean functions for F1 and F2 implement a circuit discussed in Section 4.5. Merely finding a Boolean representation of a circuit doesnt provide insight into its behavior, but in this example we will observe that the Boolean equations and truth table for F1 and F2 match those describing the functionality of what we call a full adder.    The derivation of the truth table for a circuit is a straightforward process once the output Boolean functions are known. To obtain the truth table directly from the logic diagram without going through the derivations of the Boolean functions, we proceed as follows:    1. Determine the number of input variables in the circuit. For n inputs, form the 2n        possible input combinations and list the binary numbers from 0 to (2n - 1) in a        table.    2. Label the outputs of selected gates with arbitrary symbols.    3. Obtain the truth table for the outputs of those gates which are a function of the        input variables only.    4. Proceed to obtain the truth table for the outputs of those gates which are a func-        tion of previously defined values until the columns for all outputs are determined.                 Section 4.4 Design Procedure 129      Table 4.1      Truth Table for the Logic Diagram of Fig. 4.2        A B C F2 F2 T1 T2 T3 F1      0 00 0  1  0 0  0  0      0 01 0  1  1 0  1  1      0 10 0  1  1 0  1  1      0 11 1  0  1 0  0  0      1 00 0  1  1 0  1  1      1 01 1  0  1 0  0  0      1 10 1  0  1 0  0  0      1 11 1  0  1 1  0  1         This process is illustrated with the circuit of Fig. 4.2. In Table 4.1, we form the      eight possible combinations for the three input variables. The truth table for F2 is      determined directly from the values of A, B, and C, with F2 equal to 1 for any com-      bination that has two or three inputs equal to 1. The truth table for F2 is the comple-      ment of F2. The truth tables for T1 and T2 are the OR and AND functions of the      input variables, respectively. The values for T3 are derived from T1 and F2:T3 is equal      to 1 when both T1 and F2 are equal to 1, and T3 is equal to 0 otherwise. Finally, F1 is      equal to 1 for those combinations in which either T2 or T3 or both are equal to 1.      Inspection of the truth table combinations for A, B, C, F1, and F2 shows that it is      identical to the truth table of the full adder given in Section 4.5 for x, y, z, S, and C,      respectively.         Another way of analyzing a combinational circuit is by means of logic simulation.      This is not practical, however, because the number of input patterns that might be      needed to generate meaningful outputs could be very large. But simulation has a very      practical application in verifying that the functionality of a circuit actually matches its      specification. In Section 4.12, we demonstrate the logic simulation and verification of      the circuit of Fig. 4.2, using Verilog HDL. 4.4  DESIGN PROCEDURE       The design of combinational circuits starts from the specification of the design objective       and culminates in a logic circuit diagram or a set of Boolean functions from which the       logic diagram can be obtained. The procedure involves the following steps:          1. From the specifications of the circuit, determine the required number of inputs              and outputs and assign a symbol to each.          2. Derive the truth table that defines the required relationship between inputs and              outputs.                 3. Obtain the simplified Boolean functions for each output as a function of the input                     variables.                 4. Draw the logic diagram and verify the correctness of the design (manually or by                     simulation).                 A truth table for a combinational circuit consists of input columns and output             columns. The input columns are obtained from the 2n binary numbers for the n input             variables. The binary values for the outputs are determined from the stated specifica-             tions. The output functions specified in the truth table give the exact definition of the             combinational circuit. It is important that the verbal specifications be interpreted             correctly in the truth table, as they are often incomplete, and any wrong interpretation             may result in an incorrect truth table.                 The output binary functions listed in the truth table are simplified by any available             method, such as algebraic manipulation, the map method, or a computer-based sim-             plification program. Frequently, there is a variety of simplified expressions from             which to choose. In a particular application, certain criteria will serve as a guide in             the process of choosing an implementation. A practical design must consider such             constraints as the number of gates, number of inputs to a gate, propagation time of             the signal through the gates, number of interconnections, limitations of the driving             capability of each gate (i.e., the number of gates to which the output of the circuit             may be connected), and various other criteria that must be taken into consideration             when designing integrated circuits. Since the importance of each constraint is dictated             by the particular application, it is difficult to make a general statement about what             constitutes an acceptable implementation. In most cases, the simplification begins by             satisfying an elementary objective, such as producing the simplified Boolean func-             tions in a standard form. Then the simplification proceeds with further steps to meet             other performance criteria. Code Conversion Example             The availability of a large variety of codes for the same discrete elements of information             results in the use of different codes by different digital systems. It is sometimes necessary             to use the output of one system as the input to another. A conversion circuit must be             inserted between the two systems if each uses different codes for the same information.             Thus, a code converter is a circuit that makes the two systems compatible even though             each uses a different binary code.                 To convert from binary code A to binary code B, the input lines must supply the             bit combination of elements as specified by code A and the output lines must gener-             ate the corresponding bit combination of code B. A combinational circuit performs             this transformation by means of logic gates. The design procedure will be illustrated             by an example that converts binary coded decimal (BCD) to the excess-3 code for the             decimal digits.                 The bit combinations assigned to the BCD and excess-3 codes are listed in Table 1.5             (Section 1.7). Since each code uses four bits to represent a decimal digit, there must            Section 4.4 Design Procedure 131 Table 4.2 Truth Table for Code Conversion Example Input BCD  Output Excess-3 Code A B CD     wx y                          z 0 0 00     0 0 1                         1 0 0 01 0 0 10     0 1 0                         0 0 0 11 0 1 00     0 1 0                         1 0 1 01 0 1 10     0 1 1                         0 0 1 11 1 0 00     0 1 1                         1 1 0 01            1 0 0                         0            1 0 0                         1            1 0 1                         0            1 0 1                         1            1 1 0                         0 be four input variables and four output variables. We designate the four input binary variables by the symbols A, B, C, and D, and the four output variables by w, x, y, and z. The truth table relating the input and output variables is shown in Table 4.2. The bit combinations for the inputs and their corresponding outputs are obtained directly from Section 1.7. Note that four binary variables may have 16 bit combinations, but only 10 are listed in the truth table. The six bit combinations not listed for the input variables are dont-care combinations. These values have no meaning in BCD and we assume that they will never occur in actual operation of the circuit. Therefore, we are at liberty to assign to the output variables either a 1 or a 0, whichever gives a simpler circuit.    The maps in Fig. 4.3 are plotted to obtain simplified Boolean functions for the outputs. Each one of the four maps represents one of the four outputs of the circuit as a function of the four input variables. The 1s marked inside the squares are obtained from the minterms that make the output equal to 1. The 1s are obtained from the truth table by going over the output columns one at a time. For example, the column under output z has five 1s; therefore, the map for z has five 1s, each being in a square corresponding to the minterm that makes z equal to 1. The six dont-care minterms 10 through 15 are marked with an X. One possible way to sim- plify the functions into sum-of-products form is listed under the map of each variable. (See Chapter 3.)    A two-level logic diagram for each output may be obtained directly from the Boolean expressions derived from the maps. There are various other possibilities for a logic diagram that implements this circuit. The expressions obtained in Fig. 4.3 may be manipulated algebraically for the purpose of using common gates for two or more outputs.

Not counting input inverters, the implementation in sum-of-products form requires seven AND gates and three OR gates.

Thus, the three-level logic      circuit requires fewer gates, all of which in turn require no more than two inputs. 4.5  BINARY ADDERCSUBTRACTOR       Digital computers perform a variety of information-processing tasks. Among the func-       tions encountered are the various arithmetic operations. The most basic arithmetic       operation is the addition of two binary digits. This simple addition consists of four pos-       sible elementary operations: 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 0 = 1, and 1 + 1 = 10. The       first three operations produce a sum of one digit, but when both augend and addend       bits are equal to 1, the binary sum consists of two digits. The higher significant bit of this       result is called a carry. When the augend and addend numbers contain more significant       digits, the carry obtained from the addition of two bits is added to the next higher order       pair of significant bits. A combinational circuit that performs the addition of two bits is       called a half adder. One that performs the addition of three bits (two significant bits and       a previous carry) is a full adder. The names of the circuits stem from the fact that two       half adders can be employed to implement a full adder.                 A binary adderCsubtractor is a combinational circuit that performs the arithmetic             operations of addition and subtraction with binary numbers. We will develop this             circuit by means of a hierarchical design. The half adder design is carried out first, from             which we develop the full adder. Connecting n full adders in cascade produces a binary             adder for two n-bit numbers. The subtraction circuit is included in a complementing             circuit. Half Adder             From the verbal explanation of a half adder, we find that this circuit needs two binary             inputs and two binary outputs. The input variables designate the augend and addend             bits; the output variables produce the sum and carry. We assign symbols x and y to the             two inputs and S (for sum) and C (for carry) to the outputs. The truth table for the half             adder is listed in Table 4.3. The C output is 1 only when both inputs are 1. The S output             represents the least significant bit of the sum.                 The simplified Boolean functions for the two outputs can be obtained directly from             the truth table. The simplified sum-of-products expressions are                                                            S = xy + xy                                                           C = xy                 The logic diagram of the half adder implemented in sum of products is shown in             Fig. 4.5(a). It can be also implemented with an exclusive-OR and an AND gate as shown             in Fig. 4.5(b). This form is used to show that two half adders can be used to construct a             full adder.

After             the least significant bit, addition at each position adds not only the respective bits of the             words, but must also consider a possible carry bit from addition at the previous position.                 A full adder is a combinational circuit that forms the arithmetic sum of three bits. It             consists of three inputs and two outputs. Two of the input variables, denoted by x and y,             represent the two significant bits to be added.The third input, z, represents the carry from             the previous lower significant position. Two outputs are necessary because the arithmetic             sum of three binary digits ranges in value from 0 to 3, and binary representation of 2 or 3             needs two bits. The two outputs are designated by the symbols S for sum and C for carry.             The binary variable S gives the value of the least significant bit of the sum. The binary             variable C gives the output carry formed by adding the input carry and the bits of the             words.The truth table of the full adder is listed in Table 4.4.The eight rows under the input             variables designate all possible combinations of the three variables. The output variables             are determined from the arithmetic sum of the input bits. When all input bits are 0, the             output is 0. The S output is equal to 1 when only one input is equal to 1 or when all three             inputs are equal to 1. The C output has a carry of 1 if two or three inputs are equal to 1.                 The input and output bits of the combinational circuit have different interpretations             at various stages of the problem. On the one hand, physically, the binary signals of the             inputs are considered binary digits to be added arithmetically to form a two-digit sum             at the output. On the other hand, the same binary values are considered as variables of             Boolean functions when expressed in the truth table or when the circuit is implemented             with logic gates. The maps for the outputs of the full adder are shown in Fig. 4.6.

It can be constructed with full adders connected in cascade, with the output carry             from each full adder connected to the input carry of the next full adder in the chain.

In the former case, the input carry to the least significant position is fixed at 0. Figure 4.9 shows the interconnection of four full-adder (FA) circuits to provide a four-bit binary ripple carry adder. The augend bits of A and the addend bits of B are designated by subscript numbers from right to left, with subscript 0 denoting the least significant bit. The carries are connected in a chain through the full adders. The input carry to the adder is C0, and it ripples through the full adders to the output carry C4. The S outputs generate the required sum bits. An n-bit adder requires n full adders, with each output carry connected to the input carry of the next higher order full adder.    To demonstrate with a specific example, consider the two binary numbers A = 1011 and B = 0011. Their sum S = 1110 is formed with the four-bit adder as follows:    Subscript i:  3  2  1  0    Input carry   0  1  1  0       Ci    Augend    Addend        1  0  1  1       Ai    Sum           0  0  1  1       Bi    Output carry                  1  1  1  0       Si                  0  0  1  1       Ci + 1 The bits are added with full adders, starting from the least significant position (subscript 0), to form the sum bit and carry bit. The input carry C0 in the least significant position must be 0. The value of Ci+1 in a given significant position is the output carry of the full adder. This value is transferred into the input carry of the full adder that adds the bits one higher significant position to the left. The sum bits are thus generated starting from the rightmost position and are available as soon as the corresponding previous carry bit is generated. All the carries must be generated for the correct sum bits to appear at the outputs.    The four-bit adder is a typical example of a standard component. It can be used in many applications involving arithmetic operations. Observe that the design of this circuit     B3 A3           B2 A2              B1 A1      B0 A0     FA          C3  FA             C2  FA     C1  FA     C0 C4  S3              S2                 S1         S0 FIGURE 4.9 Four-bit adder             by the classical method would require a truth table with 29 = 512 entries, since there             are nine inputs to the circuit. By using an iterative method of cascading a standard func-             tion, it is possible to obtain a simple and straightforward implementation. Carry Propagation             The addition of two binary numbers in parallel implies that all the bits of the augend             and addend are available for computation at the same time. As in any combinational             circuit, the signal must propagate through the gates before the correct output sum is             available in the output terminals. The total propagation time is equal to the propagation             delay of a typical gate, times the number of gate levels in the circuit. The longest propa-             gation delay time in an adder is the time it takes the carry to propagate through the full             adders. Since each bit of the sum output depends on the value of the input carry, the             value of Si at any given stage in the adder will be in its steady-state final value only after             the input carry to that stage has been propagated. In this regard, consider output S3 in             Fig. 4.9. Inputs A3 and B3 are available as soon as input signals are applied to the adder.             However, input carry C3 does not settle to its final value until C2 is available from the             previous stage. Similarly, C2 has to wait for C1 and so on down to C0. Thus, only after             the carry propagates and ripples through all stages will the last output S3 and carry C4             settle to their final correct value.                 The number of gate levels for the carry propagation can be found from the circuit             of the full adder. The circuit is redrawn with different labels in Fig. 4.10 for convenience.             The input and output variables use the subscript i to denote a typical stage of the adder.             The signals at Pi and Gi settle to their steady-state values after they propagate through             their respective gates. These two signals are common to all half adders and depend on             only the input augend and addend bits. The signal from the input carry Ci to the output             carry Ci + 1 propagates through an AND gate and an OR gate, which constitute two gate             levels. If there are four full adders in the adder, the output carry C4 would have             2 * 4 = 8 gate levels from C0 to C4. For an n-bit adder, there are 2n gate levels for the             carry to propagate from input to output.

Although the adderor, for that matter, any combinational circuitwill always have some value at its output terminals, the outputs will not be correct unless the signals are given enough time to propagate through the gates connected from the inputs to the outputs. Since all other arithmetic operations are implemented by successive additions, the time consumed during the addition process is critical. An obvious solution for reducing the carry propagation delay time is to employ faster gates with reduced delays. However, physical circuits have a limit to their capability. Another solution is to increase the complexity of the equipment in such a way that the carry delay time is reduced. There are several techniques for reducing the carry propagation time in a parallel adder. The most widely used technique employs the principle of carry lookahead logic.    Consider the circuit of the full adder shown in Fig. 4.10. If we define two new binary variables                                                 Pi = Ai { Bi                                                Gi = AiBi the output sum and carry can respectively be expressed as                                                 Si = Pi { Ci                                             Ci + 1 = Gi + PiCi Gi is called a carry generate, and it produces a carry of 1 when both Ai and Bi are 1, regardless of the input carry Ci. Pi is called a carry propagate, because it determines whether a carry into stage i will propagate into stage i + 1 (i.e., whether an assertion of Ci will propagate to an assertion of Ci+1).    We now write the Boolean functions for the carry outputs of each stage and substitute the value of each Ci from the previous equations:                                              C0 = input carry                                              C1 = G0 + P0C0                         C2 = G1 + P1C1 = G1 + P1 1G0 + P0C02 = G1 + P1G0 + P1P0C0                         C3 = G2 + P2C2 = G2 + P2G1 + P2P1G0 = P2P1P0C0             Since the Boolean function for each output carry is expressed in sum-of-products form,             each function can be implemented with one level of AND gates followed by an OR gate             (or by a two-level NAND). The three Boolean functions for C1, C2, and C3 are imple-             mented in the carry lookahead generator shown in Fig. 4.11. Note that this circuit can             add in less time because C3 does not have to wait for C2 and C1 to propagate; in fact, C3             is propagated at the same time as C1 and C2. This gain in speed of operation is achieved             at the expense of additional complexity (hardware).                 The construction of a four-bit adder with a carry lookahead scheme is shown in Fig. 4.12.             Each sum output requires two exclusive-OR gates. The output of the first exclusive-OR             gate generates the Pi variable, and the AND gate generates the Gi variable. The carries             are propagated through the carry lookahead generator (similar to that in Fig. 4.11) and             applied as inputs to the second exclusive-OR gate. All output carries are generated after                                                                                                             C3 P2 G2                                                                                                             C2 P1 G1 P0                                          C1          G0           C0 FIGURE 4.11 Logic diagram of carry lookahead generator     Section 4.5 Binary AdderCSubtractor 141                                      C4  C4 B3 A3 P3 P3                                                                                                               S3                                                                       C3                                            G3 B2 A2 P2 P2                                                                                                               S2                                                                       C2                                            G2                                                       Carry                                                    Lookahead                                                    Generator B1 A1 P1 P1                                                                                                               S1                                                                       C1                                            G1 B0 A0 P0 P0                                                                                                               S0                                            G0 C0  C0 FIGURE 4.12 Four-bit adder with carry lookahead a delay through two levels of gates.

Binary Subtractor             The subtraction of unsigned binary numbers can be done most conveniently by means             of complements, as discussed in Section 1.5. Remember that the subtraction A - B can             be done by taking the 2s complement of B and adding it to A. The 2s complement can             be obtained by taking the 1s complement and adding 1 to the least significant pair of             bits. The 1s complement can be implemented with inverters, and a 1 can be added to             the sum through the input carry.

The input carry C0 must    be equal to 1 when subtraction is performed.The operation thus performed becomes A,    plus the 1s complement of B, plus 1. This is equal to A plus the 2s complement of B.    For unsigned numbers, that gives A - B if A  B or the 2s complement of 1B - A2    if A 6 B. For signed numbers, the result is A - B, provided that there is no overflow.    (See Section 1.6.)       The addition and subtraction operations can be combined into one circuit with one    common binary adder by including an exclusive-OR gate with each full adder. A four-bit    adderCsubtractor circuit is shown in Fig. 4.13. The mode input M controls the operation.    When M = 0, the circuit is an adder, and when M = 1, the circuit becomes a subtractor.    Each exclusive-OR gate receives input M and one of the inputs of B. When M = 0, we    have B { 0 = B. The full adders receive the value of B, the input carry is 0, and the    circuit performs A plus B.When M = 1, we have B { 1 = B and C0 = 1. The B inputs    are all complemented and a 1 is added through the input carry. The circuit performs the    operation A plus the 2s complement of B. (The exclusive-OR with output V is for    detecting an overflow.)       It is worth noting that binary numbers in the signed-complement system are added    and subtracted by the same basic addition and subtraction rules as are unsigned num-    bers. Therefore, computers need only one common hardware circuit to handle both types    of arithmetic. The user or programmer must interpret the results of such addition or    subtraction differently, depending on whether it is assumed that the numbers are signed    or unsigned.           Section 4.5 Binary AdderCSubtractor 143 Overflow             When two numbers with n digits each are added and the sum is a number occupying             n + 1 digits, we say that an overflow occurred. This is true for binary or decimal num-             bers, signed or unsigned. When the addition is performed with paper and pencil, an             overflow is not a problem, since there is no limit by the width of the page to write down             the sum. Overflow is a problem in digital computers because the number of bits that             hold the number is finite and a result that contains n + 1 bits cannot be accommodated             by an n-bit word. For this reason, many computers detect the occurrence of an overflow,             and when it occurs, a corresponding flip-flop is set that can then be checked by the user.                 The detection of an overflow after the addition of two binary numbers depends on             whether the numbers are considered to be signed or unsigned. When two unsigned             numbers are added, an overflow is detected from the end carry out of the most signifi-             cant position. In the case of signed numbers, two details are important: the leftmost bit             always represents the sign, and negative numbers are in 2s-complement form. When             two signed numbers are added, the sign bit is treated as part of the number and the end             carry does not indicate an overflow.                 An overflow cannot occur after an addition if one number is positive and the other             is negative, since adding a positive number to a negative number produces a result             whose magnitude is smaller than the larger of the two original numbers. An overflow             may occur if the two numbers added are both positive or both negative. To see how this             can happen, consider the following example: Two signed binary numbers, +70 and +80,             are stored in two eight-bit registers. The range of numbers that each register can accom-             modate is from binary +127 to binary -128. Since the sum of the two numbers is +150,             it exceeds the capacity of an eight-bit register. This is also true for -70 and -80. The two             additions in binary are shown next, together with the last two carries: carries:  0 1           carries:  1 0    + 70      0 1000110     - 70      1 0111010    + 80      0 1010000     - 80      1 0110000   + 150      1 0010110    - 150      0 1101010 Note that the eight-bit result that should have been positive has a negative sign bit (i.e., the eighth bit) and the eight-bit result that should have been negative has a positive sign bit. If, however, the carry out of the sign bit position is taken as the sign bit of the result, then the nine-bit answer so obtained will be correct. But since the answer cannot be accommodated within eight bits, we say that an overflow has occurred.    An overflow condition can be detected by observing the carry into the sign bit position and the carry out of the sign bit position. If these two carries are not equal, an overflow has occurred. This is indicated in the examples in which the two carries are explicitly shown. If the two carries are applied to an exclusive-OR gate, an overflow is detected when the output of the gate is equal to 1. For this method to work correctly, the 2s comple- ment of a negative number must be computed by taking the 1s complement and adding 1. This takes care of the condition when the maximum negative number is complemented.                 The binary adderCsubtractor circuit with outputs C and V is shown in Fig. 4.13. If the             two binary numbers are considered to be unsigned, then the C bit detects a carry after             addition or a borrow after subtraction. If the numbers are considered to be signed, then             the V bit detects an overflow. If V = 0 after an addition or subtraction, then no overflow             occurred and the n-bit result is correct. If V = 1, then the result of the operation contains             n + 1 bits, but only the rightmost n bits of the number fit in the space available, so an             overflow has occurred. The 1n + 12 th bit is the actual sign and has been shifted out of             position. 4.6  DECIMAL ADDER       Computers or calculators that perform arithmetic operations directly in the decimal       number system represent decimal numbers in binary coded form. An adder for such       a computer must employ arithmetic circuits that accept coded decimal numbers and       present results in the same code. For binary addition, it is sufficient to consider a       pair of significant bits together with a previous carry. A decimal adder requires a       minimum of nine inputs and five outputs, since four bits are required to code each       decimal digit and the circuit must have an input and output carry. There is a wide       variety of possible decimal adder circuits, depending upon the code used to repre-       sent the decimal digits. Here we examine a decimal adder for the BCD code. (See       Section 1.7.) BCD Adder             Consider the arithmetic addition of two decimal digits in BCD, together with an input             carry from a previous stage. Since each input digit does not exceed 9, the output sum             cannot be greater than 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, the 1 in the sum being an input carry. Sup-             pose we apply two BCD digits to a four-bit binary adder. The adder will form the sum             in binary and produce a result that ranges from 0 through 19. These binary numbers             are listed in Table 4.5 and are labeled by symbols K, Z8, Z4, Z2, and Z1. K is the carry,             and the subscripts under the letter Z represent the weights 8, 4, 2, and 1 that can be             assigned to the four bits in the BCD code. The columns under the binary sum list the             binary value that appears in the outputs of the four-bit binary adder. The output sum             of two decimal digits must be represented in BCD and should appear in the form             listed in the columns under BCD Sum. The problem is to find a rule by which the             binary sum is converted to the correct BCD digit representation of the number in the             BCD sum.                 In examining the contents of the table, it becomes apparent that when the binary sum             is equal to or less than 1001, the corresponding BCD number is identical, and therefore             no conversion is needed.When the binary sum is greater than 1001, we obtain an invalid             BCD representation. The addition of binary 6 (0110) to the binary sum converts it to             the correct BCD representation and also produces an output carry as required.

It is obvious that a correction is needed when the binary sum has an output carry K = 1. The other six combinations from 1010 through 1111 that need a correction have a 1 in position Z8. To distinguish them from binary 1000 and 1001, which also have a 1 in position Z8, we specify further that either Z4 or Z2 must have a 1. The condition for a correction and an output carry can be expressed by the Bool- ean function                                         C = K + Z8Z4 + Z8Z2 When C = 1, it is necessary to add 0110 to the binary sum and provide an output carry for the next stage.    A BCD adder that adds two BCD digits and produces a sum digit in BCD is shown in Fig. 4.14. The two decimal digits, together with the input carry, are first added in the top four-bit adder to produce the binary sum. When the output carry is equal to 0, noth- ing is added to the binary sum. When it is equal to 1, binary 0110 is added to the binary sum through the bottom four-bit adder. The output carry generated from the bottom                                                                                Addend              Carry                 K   4-bit binary adder                                      Carry                                       Z8 Z4 Z2 Z1                                                in              out      Output       carry              0                                          4-bit binary adder                                       S8 S4 S2 S1      FIGURE 4.14      Block diagram of a BCD adder      adder can be ignored, since it supplies information already available at the output carry      terminal. A decimal parallel adder that adds n decimal digits needs n BCD adder stages.      The output carry from one stage must be connected to the input carry of the next higher      order stage. 4.7  BINARY MULTIPLIER       Multiplication of binary numbers is performed in the same way as multiplication of       decimal numbers. The multiplicand is multiplied by each bit of the multiplier, starting       from the least significant bit. Each such multiplication forms a partial product. Succes-       sive partial products are shifted one position to the left. The final product is obtained       from the sum of the partial products.          To see how a binary multiplier can be implemented with a combinational circuit,       consider the multiplication of two 2-bit numbers as shown in Fig. 4.15. The multiplicand                                           Section 4.7 Binary Multiplier 147            B1    B0                   A0             B1  B0            A1    A0     A1B1  A0B1  A0B0 C3  C2    A1B0   C0                   A1  B1     B0             C1                                           HA     HA                                           C3 C2  C1      C0 FIGURE 4.15 Two-bit by two-bit binary multiplier bits are B1 and B0, the multiplier bits are A1 and A0, and the product is C3C2C1C0. The first partial product is formed by multiplying B1B0 by A0. The multiplication of two bits such as A0 and B0 produces a 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it produces a 0. This is iden- tical to an AND operation. Therefore, the partial product can be implemented with AND gates as shown in the diagram. The second partial product is formed by multiply- ing B1B0 by A1 and shifting one position to the left. The two partial products are added with two half-adder (HA) circuits. Usually, there are more bits in the partial products and it is necessary to use full adders to produce the sum of the partial products. Note that the least significant bit of the product does not have to go through an adder, since it is formed by the output of the first AND gate.    A combinational circuit binary multiplier with more bits can be constructed in a similar fashion. A bit of the multiplier is ANDed with each bit of the multiplicand in as many levels as there are bits in the multiplier. The binary output in each level of AND gates is added with the partial product of the previous level to form a new partial prod- uct. The last level produces the product. For J multiplier bits and K multiplicand bits, we need 1J * K2 AND gates and 1J - 12 K-bit adders to produce a product of (J + K) bits.    As a second example, consider a multiplier circuit that multiplies a binary number represented by four bits by a number represented by three bits. Let the multiplicand be represented by B3B2B1B0 and the multiplier by A2A1A0. Since K = 4 and J = 3, we need 12 AND gates and two 4-bit adders to produce a product of seven bits. The logic diagram of the multiplier is shown in Fig. 4.16.

A magnitude comparator is a       combinational circuit that compares two numbers A and B and determines their relative       magnitudes. The outcome of the comparison is specified by three binary variables that       indicate whether A 7 B, A = B, or A 6 B.          On the one hand, the circuit for comparing two n-bit numbers has 22n entries in the       truth table and becomes too cumbersome, even with n = 3. On the other hand, as one                                                 Section 4.8 Magnitude Comparator 149 may suspect, a comparator circuit possesses a certain amount of regularity. Digital func- tions that possess an inherent well-defined regularity can usually be designed by means of an algorithma procedure which specifies a finite set of steps that, if followed, give the solution to a problem. We illustrate this method here by deriving an algorithm for the design of a four-bit magnitude comparator.    The algorithm is a direct application of the procedure a person uses to compare the relative magnitudes of two numbers. Consider two numbers, A and B, with four digits each. Write the coefficients of the numbers in descending order of significance:                                             A = A3 A2 A1 A0                                             B = B3 B2 B1 B0 Each subscripted letter represents one of the digits in the number. The two numbers are equal if all pairs of significant digits are equal: A3 = B3, A2 = B2, A1 = B1, and A0 = B0. When the numbers are binary, the digits are either 1 or 0, and the equality of each pair of bits can be expressed logically with an exclusive-NOR function as                                xi = AiBi + Ai Bi for i = 0, 1, 2, 3 where xi = 1 only if the pair of bits in position i are equal (i.e., if both are 1 or both are 0).    The equality of the two numbers A and B is displayed in a combinational circuit by an output binary variable that we designate by the symbol 1A = B2. This binary vari- able is equal to 1 if the input numbers, A and B, are equal, and is equal to 0 otherwise. For equality to exist, all xi variables must be equal to 1, a condition that dictates an AND operation of all variables:                                           1A = B2 = x3x2x1x0 The binary variable 1A = B2 is equal to 1 only if all pairs of digits of the two numbers are equal.    To determine whether A is greater or less than B, we inspect the relative magnitudes of pairs of significant digits, starting from the most significant position. If the two digits of a pair are equal, we compare the next lower significant pair of digits. The comparison continues until a pair of unequal digits is reached. If the corresponding digit of A is 1 and that of B is 0, we conclude that A 7 B. If the corresponding digit of A is 0 and that of B is 1, we have A 6 B. The sequential comparison can be expressed logically by the two Boolean functions                1A 7 B2 = A3B3 + x3A2B2 + x3x2A1B1 + x3x2x1A0B0                1A 6 B2 = A3B3 + x3A2B2 + x3x2A1B1 + x3x2x1An0B0 The symbols 1A 7 B2 and 1A 6 B2 are binary output variables that are equal to 1 when A 7 B and A 6 B, respectively.    The gate implementation of the three output variables just derived is simpler than it seems because it involves a certain amount of repetition. The unequal outputs can use the same gates that are needed to generate the equal output. The logic diagram of the four-bit magnitude comparator is shown in Fig. 4.17. The four x outputs are generated                         A3                                                                             x3                         B3      A2                                                                         (A  B)                                                         x2      B2      A1                                                         x1      B1      A0                                                                         (A  B)                                                         x0      B0                                                                                 (A  B)      FIGURE 4.17      Four-bit magnitude comparator      with exclusive-NOR circuits and are applied to an AND gate to give the output binary      variable 1A = B2. The other two outputs use the x variables to generate the Boolean      functions listed previously. This is a multilevel implementation and has a regular pattern.      The procedure for obtaining magnitude comparator circuits for binary numbers with      more than four bits is obvious from this example. 4.9  DECODERS       Discrete quantities of information are represented in digital systems by binary codes.       A binary code of n bits is capable of representing up to 2n distinct elements of coded       information. A decoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary information from                                                                      Section 4.9 Decoders 151 n input lines to a maximum of 2n unique output lines. If the n-bit coded information has unused combinations, the decoder may have fewer than 2n outputs.    The decoders presented here are called n-to-m-line decoders, where m  2n. Their purpose is to generate the 2n (or fewer) minterms of n input variables. Each combination of inputs will assert a unique output. The name decoder is also used in conjunction with other code converters, such as a BCD-to-seven-segment decoder.    As an example, consider the three-to-eight-line decoder circuit of Fig. 4.18. The three inputs are decoded into eight outputs, each representing one of the minterms of the three input variables. The three inverters provide the complement of the inputs, and each one of the eight AND gates generates one of the minterms. A particular application of this decoder is binary-to-octal conversion. The input variables represent a binary num- ber, and the outputs represent the eight digits of a number in the octal number system. However, a three-to-eight-line decoder can be used for decoding any three-bit code to provide eight outputs, one for each element of the code.

For each possible input combination, there are seven outputs that are equal to 0 and    only one that is equal to 1. The output whose value is equal to 1 represents the minterm    equivalent of the binary number currently available in the input lines.       Some decoders are constructed with NAND gates. Since a NAND gate produces the    AND operation with an inverted output, it becomes more economical to generate the    decoder minterms in their complemented form. Furthermore, decoders include one or    more enable inputs to control the circuit operation. A two-to-four-line decoder with an    enable input constructed with NAND gates is shown in Fig. 4.19. The circuit operates    with complemented outputs and a complement enable input. The decoder is enabled    when E is equal to 0 (i.e., active-low enable).

The output whose value is equal to 0 represents the minterm selected by inputs A and B.The circuit is disabled when E is equal to 1, regardless of the values of the other two inputs. When the circuit is disabled, none of the outputs are equal to 0 and none of the minterms are selected. In general, a decoder may operate with complemented or uncomplemented outputs. The enable input may be activated with a 0 or with a 1 signal. Some decoders have two or more enable inputs that must satisfy a given logic condition in order to enable the circuit.    A decoder with enable input can function as a demultiplexera circuit that receives information from a single line and directs it to one of 2n possible output lines. The selection of a specific output is controlled by the bit combination of n selection lines. The decoder of Fig. 4.19 can function as a one-to-four-line demultiplexer when E is taken as a data input line and A and B are taken as the selection inputs. The single input variable E has a path to all four outputs, but the input information is directed to only one of the output lines, as specified by the binary combination of the two selection lines A and B. This feature can be verified from the truth table of the circuit. For example, if the selection lines AB = 10, output D2 will be the same as the input value E, while all other outputs are maintained at 1. Because decoder and demultiplexer operations are obtained from the same circuit, a decoder with an enable input is referred to as a decoderCdemultiplexer.    Decoders with enable inputs can be connected together to form a larger decoder circuit. Figure 4.20 shows two 3-to-8-line decoders with enable inputs connected to form a 4-to-16-line decoder. When w  0, the top decoder is enabled and the other is disabled. The bottom decoder outputs are all 0s, and the top eight outputs generate minterms 0000 to 0111. When w  1, the enable conditions are reversed: The bottom decoder outputs generate minterms 1000 to 1111, while the outputs of the top decoder are all 0s. This example demonstrates the usefulness of enable inputs in decoders and other x y  38                                               D0 to D7    decoder z  E w     38                                              D8 to D15    decoder        E FIGURE 4.20 4 * 16 decoder constructed with two 3 * 8 decoders             combinational logic components. In general, enable inputs are a convenient feature for             interconnecting two or more standard components for the purpose of combining them             into a similar function with more inputs and outputs. Combinational Logic Implementation             A decoder provides the 2n minterms of n input variables. Each asserted output of the             decoder is associated with a unique pattern of input bits. Since any Boolean function             can be expressed in sum-of-minterms form, a decoder that generates the minterms of             the function, together with an external OR gate that forms their logical sum, provides             a hardware implementation of the function. In this way, any combinational circuit with             n inputs and m outputs can be implemented with an n-to-2n-line decoder and m OR             gates.                 The procedure for implementing a combinational circuit by means of a decoder and             OR gates requires that the Boolean function for the circuit be expressed as a sum of             minterms. A decoder is then chosen that generates all the minterms of the input vari-             ables. The inputs to each OR gate are selected from the decoder outputs according to             the list of minterms of each function. This procedure will be illustrated by an example             that implements a full-adder circuit.                 From the truth table of the full adder (see Table 4.4), we obtain the functions for the             combinational circuit in sum-of-minterms form:                                                     S(x, y, z) = (1, 2, 4, 7)                                                     C (x, y, z) = (3, 5, 6, 7)             Since there are three inputs and a total of eight minterms, we need a three-to-eight-line             decoder. The implementation is shown in Fig. 4.21. The decoder generates the eight             minterms for x, y, and z. The OR gate for output S forms the logical sum of minterms 1,             2, 4, and 7. The OR gate for output C forms the logical sum of minterms 3, 5, 6, and 7.             0             1                                                                   S x  22       2    21 3  8  3 y      decoder 4 z  20       5                                  C             6             7 FIGURE 4.21 Implementation of a full adder with a decoder                                                                                 Section 4.10 Encoders 155                 A function with a long list of minterms requires an OR gate with a large number of             inputs. A function having a list of k minterms can be expressed in its complemented form             F with 2n - k minterms. If the number of minterms in the function is greater than 2n>2,             then F can be expressed with fewer minterms. In such a case, it is advantageous to use             a NOR gate to sum the minterms of F. The output of the NOR gate complements this             sum and generates the normal output F. If NAND gates are used for the decoder, as in             Fig. 4.19, then the external gates must be NAND gates instead of OR gates. This is             because a two-level NAND gate circuit implements a sum-of-minterms function and is             equivalent to a two-level ANDCOR circuit. 4.10 ENCODERS             An encoder is a digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of a decoder. An             encoder has 2n (or fewer) input lines and n output lines. The output lines, as an aggregate,             generate the binary code corresponding to the input value. An example of an encoder             is the octal-to-binary encoder whose truth table is given in Table 4.7. It has eight inputs             (one for each of the octal digits) and three outputs that generate the corresponding             binary number. It is assumed that only one input has a value of 1 at any given time.                 The encoder can be implemented with OR gates whose inputs are determined             directly from the truth table. Output z is equal to 1 when the input octal digit is 1, 3, 5,             or 7. Output y is 1 for octal digits 2, 3, 6, or 7, and output x is 1 for digits 4, 5, 6, or 7. These             conditions can be expressed by the following Boolean output functions:                                                     z = D1 + D3 + D5 + D7                                                     y = D2 + D3 + D6 + D7                                                     x = D4 + D5 + D6 + D7             The encoder can be implemented with three OR gates.

If two inputs are active simultaneously, the output produces an unde-             fined combination. For example, if D3 and D6 are 1 simultaneously, the output of the             encoder will be 111 because all three outputs are equal to 1. The output 111 does not             represent either binary 3 or binary 6. To resolve this ambiguity, encoder circuits must             establish an input priority to ensure that only one input is encoded. If we establish a             higher priority for inputs with higher subscript numbers, and if both D3 and D6 are 1 at             the same time, the output will be 110 because D6 has higher priority than D3.                 Another ambiguity in the octal-to-binary encoder is that an output with all 0s is             generated when all the inputs are 0; but this output is the same as when D0 is equal to 1.             The discrepancy can be resolved by providing one more output to indicate whether at             least one input is equal to 1. Priority Encoder             A priority encoder is an encoder circuit that includes the priority function. The operation             of the priority encoder is such that if two or more inputs are equal to 1 at the same time,             the input having the highest priority will take precedence. The truth table of a four-input             priority encoder is given in Table 4.8. In addition to the two outputs x and y, the circuit             has a third output designated by V; this is a valid bit indicator that is set to 1 when one or             more inputs are equal to 1. If all inputs are 0, there is no valid input and V is equal to 0.             The other two outputs are not inspected when V equals 0 and are specified as dont-care             conditions. Note that whereas Xs in output columns represent dont-care conditions, the             Xs in the input columns are useful for representing a truth table in condensed form.             Instead of listing all 16 minterms of four variables, the truth table uses an X to represent             either 1 or 0. For example, X100 represents the two minterms 0100 and 1100.                 According to Table 4.8, the higher the subscript number, the higher the priority of             the input. Input D3 has the highest priority, so, regardless of the values of the other             inputs, when this input is 1, the output for xy is 11 (binary 3). D2 has the next priority             level. The output is 10 if D2 = 1, provided that D3 = 0, regardless of the values of the             other two lower priority inputs. The output for D1 is generated only if higher priority             inputs are 0, and so on down the priority levels.

The minterms for the two functions are derived from Table 4.8. Although the table has only five rows, when each X in a row is replaced first by 0 and then by 1, we obtain all 16 possible input com- binations. For example, the fourth row in the table, with inputs XX10, represents the four minterms 0010, 0110, 1010, and 1110.The simplified Boolean expressions for the priority encoder are obtained from the maps. The condition for output V is an OR function of all the input variables. The priority encoder is implemented in Fig. 4.23 according to the following Boolean functions:                                        x = D2 + D3                                        y = D3 + D1 D2                                       V = D0 + D1 + D2 + D3                  D3                  D2                                                      y                  D1                                                                          x                  D0                                                      V FIGURE 4.23 Four-input priority encoder 4.11 MULTIPLEXERS             A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects binary information from one of             many input lines and directs it to a single output line. The selection of a particular input             line is controlled by a set of selection lines. Normally, there are 2n input lines and n selec-             tion lines whose bit combinations determine which input is selected.                 A two-to-one-line multiplexer connects one of two 1-bit sources to a common desti-             nation, as shown in Fig. 4.24. The circuit has two data input lines, one output line, and             one selection line S. When S = 0, the upper AND gate is enabled and I0 has a path to             the output. When S = 1, the lower AND gate is enabled and I1 has a path to the output.             The multiplexer acts like an electronic switch that selects one of two sources. The block             diagram of a multiplexer is sometimes depicted by a wedge-shaped symbol, as shown in             Fig. 4.24(b). It suggests visually how a selected one of multiple data sources is directed             into a single destination. The multiplexer is often labeled MUX in block diagrams.                 A four-to-one-line multiplexer is shown in Fig. 4.25. Each of the four inputs, I0             through I3, is applied to one input of an AND gate. Selection lines S1 and S0 are decoded             to select a particular AND gate. The outputs of the AND gates are applied to a single             OR gate that provides the one-line output. The function table lists the input that is             passed to the output for each combination of the binary selection values. To demonstrate             the operation of the circuit, consider the case when S1S0 = 10. The AND gate associated             with input I2 has two of its inputs equal to 1 and the third input connected to I2. The             other three AND gates have at least one input equal to 0, which makes their outputs             equal to 0. The output of the OR gate is now equal to the value of I2, providing a path             from the selected input to the output. A multiplexer is also called a data selector, since             it selects one of many inputs and steers the binary information to the output line.                 The AND gates and inverters in the multiplexer resemble a decoder circuit, and indeed,             they decode the selection input lines. In general, a 2n-to-1-line multiplexer is constructed             from an n-to-2n decoder by adding 2n input lines to it, one to each AND gate.The outputs             of the AND gates are applied to a single OR gate.

The n selection lines are implied from the 2n data lines. As in decoders, multiplexers may have an enable input to control the operation of the unit. When the enable input is in the inactive state, the outputs are disabled, and when it is in the active state, the circuit functions as a normal multiplexer.    Multiplexer circuits can be combined with common selection inputs to provide multiple-bit selection logic. As an illustration, a quadruple 2-to-1-line multiplexer is shown in Fig. 4.26. The circuit has four multiplexers, each capable of selecting one of two input lines. Output Y0 can be selected to come from either input A0 or input B0. Similarly, output Y1 may have the value of A1 or B1, and so on. Input selection line S selects one of the lines in each of the four multiplexers. The enable input E must be active (i.e., asserted) for normal operation. Although the circuit contains four 2-to-1-line multiplexers, we are more likely to view it as a circuit that selects one of two 4-bit sets of data lines. As shown in the function table, the unit is enabled when E = 0. Then, if S = 0, the four A inputs have a path to the four outputs. If, by contrast, S = 1, the four B inputs are applied to the outputs. The outputs have all 0s when E = 1, regardless of the value of S. Boolean Function Implementation             In Section 4.9, it was shown that a decoder can be used to implement Boolean functions             by employing external OR gates. An examination of the logic diagram of a multiplexer             reveals that it is essentially a decoder that includes the OR gate within the unit.

The individual minterms can be selected by the data inputs, thereby             providing a method of implementing a Boolean function of n variables with a multi-             plexer that has n selection inputs and 2n data inputs, one for each minterm.                 We will now show a more efficient method for implementing a Boolean function of             n variables with a multiplexer that has n - 1 selection inputs. The first n - 1 variables             of the function are connected to the selection inputs of the multiplexer. The remaining             single variable of the function is used for the data inputs. If the single variable is denoted                                                                Section 4.11 Multiplexers 161 by z, each data input of the multiplexer will be z, z, 1, or 0. To demonstrate this proce- dure, consider the Boolean function                                         F (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 6, 7) This function of three variables can be implemented with a four-to-one-line multiplexer as shown in Fig. 4.27. The two variables x and y are applied to the selection lines in that order; x is connected to the S1 input and y to the S0 input. The values for the data input lines are determined from the truth table of the function. When xy = 00, output F is equal to z because F = 0 when z = 0 and F = 1 when z = 1. This requires that variable z be applied to data input 0.The operation of the multiplexer is such that when xy = 00, data input 0 has a path to the output, and that makes F equal to z. In a similar fashion, we can determine the required input to data lines 1, 2, and 3 from the value of F when xy = 01, 10, and 11, respectively. This particular example shows all four possibilities that can be obtained for the data inputs.    The general procedure for implementing any Boolean function of n variables with a multiplexer with n - 1 selection inputs and 2n-1 data inputs follows from the previous example. To begin with, Boolean function is listed in a truth table. Then first n - 1 vari- ables in the table are applied to the selection inputs of the multiplexer. For each com- bination of the selection variables, we evaluate the output as a function of the last variable. This function can be 0, 1, the variable, or the complement of the variable. These values are then applied to the data inputs in the proper order.    As a second example, consider the implementation of the Boolean function                            F (A, B, C, D) = (1, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) This function is implemented with a multiplexer with three selection inputs as shown in Fig. 4.28. Note that the first variable A must be connected to selection input S2 so that A, B, and C correspond to selection inputs S2, S1, and S0, respectively.

The corresponding data line number is determined from the binary combination of ABC. For example, the table shows that when ABC = 101, F = D, so the input variable D is applied to data input 5. The binary constants 0 and 1 correspond to two fixed signal values. When inte- grated circuits are used, logic 0 corresponds to signal ground and logic 1 is equivalent to the power signal, depending on the technology (e.g., 3 V). Three-State Gates             A multiplexer can be constructed with three-state gatesdigital circuits that exhibit             three states. Two of the states are signals equivalent to logic 1 and logic 0 as in a conven-             tional gate. The third state is a high-impedance state in which (1) the logic behaves like             an open circuit, which means that the output appears to be disconnected, (2) the circuit             has no logic significance, and (3) the circuit connected to the output of the three-state             gate is not affected by the inputs to the gate. Three-state gates may perform any con-             ventional logic, such as AND or NAND. However, the one most commonly used is the             buffer gate.                 The graphic symbol for a three-state buffer gate is shown in Fig. 4.29. It is distinguished             from a normal buffer by an input control line entering the bottom of the symbol. The             buffer has a normal input, an output, and a control input that determines the state of the             output. When the control input is equal to 1, the output is enabled and the gate behaves             like a conventional buffer, with the output equal to the normal input. When the control                                                                    Section 4.11 Multiplexers 163                                   Normal input A                      Output Y  A if C  1                                                                    High-impedance if C  0                                   Control input C         FIGURE 4.29         Graphic symbol for a three-state buffer         input is 0, the output is disabled and the gate goes to a high-impedance state, regardless         of the value in the normal input. The high-impedance state of a three-state gate provides         a special feature not available in other gates. Because of this feature, a large number of         three-state gate outputs can be connected with wires to form a common line without         endangering loading effects.            The construction of multiplexers with three-state buffers is demonstrated in Fig. 4.30.         Figure 4.30(a) shows the construction of a two-to-one-line multiplexer with 2 three-state         buffers and an inverter. The two outputs are connected together to form a single output         line. (Note that this type of connection cannot be made with gates that do not have         three-state outputs.) When the select input is 0, the upper buffer is enabled by its control         input and the lower buffer is disabled. Output Y is then equal to input A.When the select         input is 1, the lower buffer is enabled and Y is equal to B.            The construction of a four-to-one-line multiplexer is shown in Fig. 4.30(b). The out-         puts of 4 three-state buffers are connected together to form a single output line. The         control inputs to the buffers determine which one of the four normal inputs I0 through            I0                                                                              Y            I1            I2      A  Y  I3      B                                                                 0 Select                                                        Select  S1      1                                                       Enable       24                                                                S0 decoder 2         (a) 2-to-1-line mux                                    EN           FIGURE 4.30           Multiplexers with three-state gates                          3                                                                    (b) 4-to-1-line mux             I3 will be connected to the output line. No more than one buffer may be in the active             state at any given time. The connected buffers must be controlled so that only 1 three-             state buffer has access to the output while all other buffers are maintained in a high-             impedance state. One way to ensure that no more than one control input is active at any             given time is to use a decoder, as shown in the diagram. When the enable input of the             decoder is 0, all of its four outputs are 0 and the bus line is in a high-impedance state             because all four buffers are disabled. When the enable input is active, one of the three-             state buffers will be active, depending on the binary value in the select inputs of the             decoder. Careful investigation reveals that this circuit is another way of constructing a             four-to-one-line multiplexer. 4.12  HDL MODELS OF COMBINATIONAL       CIRCUITS       The Verilog HDL was introduced in Section 3.10. In the current section, we introduce       additional features of Verilog, present more elaborate examples, and compare alternative       descriptions of combinational circuits in Verilog. Sequential circuits are presented in       Chapter 5. As mentioned previously, the module is the basic building block for modeling       hardware with the Verilog HDL. The logic of a module can be described in any one (or a       combination) of the following modeling styles:            Gate-level modeling using instantiations of predefined and user-defined primitive              gates.            Dataflow modeling using continuous assignment statements with the keyword              assign.            Behavioral modeling using procedural assignment statements with the keyword              always.       Gate-level (structural) modeling describes a circuit by specifying its gates and how they       are connected with each other. Dataflow modeling is used mostly for describing the       Boolean equations of combinational logic. Well also consider here behavioral modeling       that is used to describe combinational and sequential circuits at a higher level of abstrac-       tion. Combinational logic can be designed with truth tables, Boolean equations, and       schematics; Verilog has a construct corresponding to each of these classical approaches       to design: user-defined primitives, continuous assignments, and primitives, as shown in       Fig. 4.31.There is one other modeling style, called switch-level modeling. It is sometimes       used in the simulation of MOS transistor circuit models, but not in logic synthesis. We       will not consider switch-level modeling. Gate-Level Modeling             Gate-level modeling was introduced in Section 3.10 with a simple example. In this type             of representation, a circuit is specified by its logic gates and their interconnections. Gate-             level modeling provides a textual description of a schematic diagram. The Verilog HDL Section 4.12 HDL Models of Combinational Circuits 165                              Verilog model                         (combinational logic)              Continuous assignment              Boolean equation Truth table                         Schematic FIGURE 4.31 Relationship of Verilog constructs to truth tables, Boolean equations, and schematics includes 12 basic gates as predefined primitives. Four of these primitive gates are of the three-state type. The other eight are the same as the ones listed in Section 2.8. They are all declared with the lowercase keywords and, nand, or, nor, xor, xnor, not, and buf. Primitives such as and are n-input primitives.They can have any number of scalar inputs (e.g., a three-input and primitive). The buf and not primitives are n-output primitives. A single input can drive multiple output lines distinguished by their identifiers.    The Verilog language includes a functional description of each type of gate, too. The logic of each gate is based on a four-valued system. When the gates are simulated, the simulator assigns one value to the output of each gate at any instant. In addition to the two logic values of 0 and 1, there are two other values: unknown and high impedance. An unknown value is denoted by x and a high impedance by z. An unknown value is assigned during simulation when the logic value of a signal is ambiguousfor instance, if it cannot be determined whether its value is 0 or 1 (e.g., a flip-flop without a reset condition). A high-impedance condition occurs at the output of three-state gates that are not enabled or if a wire is inadvertently left unconnected. The four-valued logic truth tables for the and, or, xor, and not primitives are shown in Table 4.9. The truth table for the other four gates is the same, except that the outputs are complemented. Note that for the and gate, the output is 1 only when both inputs are 1 and the output is 0 if any input is 0. Otherwise, if one input is x or z, the output is x. The output of the or gate is 0 if both inputs are 0, is 1 if any input is 1, and is x otherwise.    When a primitive gate is listed in a module, we say that it is instantiated in the module. In general, component instantiations are statements that reference lower level compo- nents in the design, essentially creating unique copies (or instances) of those components in the higher level module. Thus, a module that uses a gate in its description is said to Table 4.9 Truth Table for Predefined Primitive Gates and 0 1 x z                        or 0 1 x z  0 0000                            0 01 xx  1 01xx                            1 11 11  x 0xxx                            x x1 xx  z 0xxx                            z x1 xx xor 0 1 x z                        not input    output  0 01xx                                      0     1  1 10xx                                      1     0  x xxxx                                      x     x  z xxxx                                      z     x instantiate the gate. Think of instantiation as the HDL counterpart of placing and connecting parts on a circuit board.    We now present two examples of gate-level modeling. Both examples use identifiers having multiple bit widths, called vectors. The syntax specifying a vector includes within square brackets two numbers separated with a colon. The following Verilog statements specify two vectors:    output [0: 3] D;    wire [7: 0] SUM; The first statement declares an output vector D with four bits, 0 through 3. The second declares a wire vector SUM with eight bits numbered 7 through 0. (Note: The first (left- most) number (array index) listed is always the most significant bit of the vector.) The individual bits are specified within square brackets, so D[2] specifies bit 2 of D. It is also possible to address parts (contiguous bits) of vectors. For example, SUM[2: 0] specifies the three least significant bits of vector SUM.    HDL Example 4.1 shows the gate-level description of a two-to-four-line decoder. (See Fig. 4.19.) This decoder has two data inputs A and B and an enable input E. The four outputs are specified with the vector D.The wire declaration is for internal connec- tions. Three not gates produce the complement of the inputs, and four nand gates provide the outputs for D. Remember that the output is always listed first in the port list of a primitive, followed by the inputs. This example describes the decoder of Fig. 4.19 and follows the procedures established in Section 3.10. Note that the keywords not and nand are written only once and do not have to be repeated for each gate, but commas must be inserted at the end of each of the gates in the series, except for the last statement, which must be terminated with a semicolon.        Section 4.12 HDL Models of Combinational Circuits 167 HDL Example 4.1 (Two-to-Four-Line Decoder) // Gate-level description of two-to-four-line decoder // Refer to Fig. 4.19 with symbol E replaced by enable, for clarity. module decoder_2x4_gates (D, A, B, enable); output  [0: 3]  D; input           A, B; input           enable; wire            A_not,B_not, enable_not;  not    G1 (A_not, A),    G2 (B_not, B),    G3 (enable_not, enable);  nand    G4 (D[0], A_not, B_not, enable_not),    G5 (D[1], A_not, B, enable_not),    G6 (D[2], A, B_not, enable_not),    G7 (D[3], A, B, enable_not); endmodule    Two or more modules can be combined to build a hierarchical description of a design. There are two basic types of design methodologies: top down and bottom up. In a top-down design, the top-level block is defined and then the subblocks necessary to build the top-level block are identified. In a bottom-up design, the building blocks are first identified and then combined to build the top-level block. Take, for example, the binary adder of Fig. 4.9. It can be considered as a top-block component built with four full-adder blocks, while each full adder is built with two half-adder blocks. In a top-down design, the four-bit adder is defined first, and then the two adders are described. In a bottom-up design, the half adder is defined, then each full adder is constructed, and then the four-bit adder is built from the full adders.    A bottom-up hierarchical description of a four-bit adder is shown in HDL Example 4.2. The half adder is defined by instantiating primitive gates. The next mod- ule describes the full adder by instantiating and connecting two half adders. The third module describes the four-bit adder by instantiating and connecting four full adders. Note that the first character of an identifier cannot be a number, but can be an under- score, so the module name _4bitadder is valid. An alternative name that is meaningful, but does not require a leading underscore, is adder_4_bit. The instantiation is done by using the name of the module that is instantiated together with a new (or the same) set of port names. For example, the half adder HA1 inside the full adder module is instantiated with ports S1, C1, x, and y. This produces a half adder with outputs S1 and C1 and inputs x and y.

The first version of the standard (1995) uses separate statements for these declarations.                                        Section 4.12 HDL Models of Combinational Circuits 169                 Note that modules can be instantiated (nested) within other modules, but module             declarations cannot be nested; that is, a module definition (declaration) cannot be placed             within another module declaration. In other words, a module definition cannot be             inserted into the text between the module and endmodule keywords of another module.             The only way one module definition can be incorporated into another module is by             instantiating it. Instantiating modules within other modules creates a hierarchical             decomposition of a design. A description of a module is said to be a structural descrip-             tion if it is composed of instantiations of other modules. Note also that instance names             must be specified when defined modules are instantiated (such as FA0 for the first full             adder in the third module), but using a name is optional when instantiating primitive             gates. Module ripple_carry_4_bit_adder is composed of instantiated and interconnected             full adders, each of which is itself composed of half adders and some glue logic. The top             level, or parent module, of the design hierarchy is the module ripple_carry_4_bit_adder.             Four copies of full_adder are its child modules, etc. C0 is an input of the cell forming the             least significant bit of the chain, and C4 is the output of the cell forming the most             significant bit. Three-State Gates             As mentioned in Section 4.11, a three-state gate has a control input that can place the             gate into a high-impedance state. The high-impedance state is symbolized by z in Verilog.             There are four types of three-state gates, as shown in Fig. 4.32. The bufif1 gate behaves             like a normal buffer if control = 1. The output goes to a high-impedance state z when             control = 0. The bufif0 gate behaves in a similar fashion, except that the high-impedance             state occurs when control = 1. The two notif gates operate in a similar manner, except             that the output is the complement of the input when the gate is not in a high-impedance             state. The gates are instantiated with the statement                                                gate name 1output, input, control2; in                                     out  in                   out control bufif1                              control bufif0 in                                     out  in                   out                       control  notif1       control                                                          notif0 FIGURE 4.32 Three-state gates The gate name can be that of any 1 of the 4 three-state gates. In simulation, the output can result in 0, 1, x, or z. Two examples of gate instantiation are bufif1 (OUT, A, control); notif0 (Y, B, enable); In the first example, input A is transferred to OUT when control = 1. OUT goes to z when control = 0. In the second example, output Y = z when enable = 1 and output Y = B when enable = 0.    The outputs of three-state gates can be connected together to form a common output line. To identify such a connection, Verilog HDL uses the keyword tri (for tristate) to indicate that the output has multiple drivers. As an example, consider the two-to-one- line multiplexer with three-state gates shown in Fig. 4.33.    The HDL description must use a tri data type for the output: // Mux with three-state output module mux_tri (m_out, A, B, select); output m_out; input A, B, select; tri  m_out;  bufif1 (m_out, A, select);  bufif0 (m_out, B, select); endmodule The 2 three-state buffers have the same output. In order to show that they have a com- mon connection, it is necessary to declare m_out with the keyword tri.    Keywords wire and tri are examples of a set of data types called nets, which represent connections between hardware elements. In simulation, their value is determined by a continuous assignment statement or by the device whose output they represent. The word net is not a keyword, but represents a class of data types, such as wire, wor, wand, tri, supply1, and supply0. The wire declaration is used most frequently. In fact, if an identifier is used, but not declared, the language specifies that it will be interpreted (by default) as a wire.The net wor models the hardware implementation of the wired-OR configuration (emitter-coupled logic). The wand models the wired-AND configuration (open-collector technology; see Fig. 3.26). The nets supply1 and supply0 represent power supply and ground, respectively. They are used to hardwire an input of a device to either 1 or 0.

Verilog HDL provides about 30 different operators.             Table 4.10 lists some of these operators, their symbols, and the operation that they per-             form. (A complete list of operators supported by Verilog 2001, 2005 can be found in             Table 8.1 in Section 8.2.) It is necessary to distinguish between arithmetic and logic             operations, so different symbols are used for each. The plus symbol 1+ 2 indicates the             arithmetic operation of addition; the bitwise logic AND operation (conjunction) uses             the symbol &. There are special symbols for bitwise logical OR (disjunction), NOT, and             XOR. The equality symbol uses two equals signs (without spaces between them) to             distinguish it from the equals sign used with the assign statement. The bitwise operators             operate bit by bit on a pair of vector operands to produce a vector result. The concat-             enation operator provides a mechanism for appending multiple operands. For example,             two operands with two bits each can be concatenated to form an operand with four bits.             The conditional operator acts like a multiplexer and is explained later, in conjunction             with HDL Example 4.6.                 It should be noted that a bitwise operator (e.g., &) and its corresponding logical             operator (e.g., ! ) may produce different results, depending on their operand. If the             operands are scalar the results will be identical; if the operands are vectors the result             will not necessarily match. For example, & (1010) is (0101), and !(1010) is 0. A binary             value is considered to be logically true if it is not 0. In general, use the bitwise opera-             tors to describe arithmetic operations and the logical operators to describe logical             operations.                 Dataflow modeling uses continuous assignments and the keyword assign. A continu-             ous assignment is a statement that assigns a value to a net. The data type family net is             used in Verilog HDL to represent a physical connection between circuit elements. A net Table 4.10 Some Verilog HDL Operators Symbol  Operation           Symbol  Operation         binary addition         binary subtraction &       bitwise AND         &&      logical AND         bitwise OR          ||      logical OR ^       bitwise XOR         bitwise NOT         !       logical NOT         equality         greater than         less than {}      concatenation ?:      conditional             is declared explicitly by a net keyword (e.g., wire) or by declaring an identifier to be an             input port. The logic value associated with a net is determined by what the net is con-             nected to. If the net is connected to an output of a gate, the net is said to be driven by             the gate, and the logic value of the net is determined by the logic values of the inputs to             the gate and the truth table of the gate. If the identifier of a net is the left-hand side of             a continuous assignment statement or a procedural assignment statement, the value             assigned to the net is specified by a Boolean expression that uses operands and opera-             tors. As an example, assuming that the variables were declared, a two-to-one-line mul-             tiplexer with scalar data inputs A and B, select input S, and output Y is described with             the continuous assignment                                                 assign Y  (A && S) || (B && S)             The relationship between Y, A, B, and S is declared by the keyword assign, followed by             the target output Y and an equals sign. Following the equals sign is a Boolean expres-             sion. In hardware terms, this assignment would be equivalent to connecting the output             of the OR gate to wire Y.                 The next two examples show the dataflow models of the two previous gate-level             examples. The dataflow description of a two-to-four-line decoder with active-low output             enable and inverted output is shown in HDL Example 4.3. The circuit is defined with             four continuous assignment statements using Boolean expressions, one for each output.             The dataflow description of the four-bit adder is shown in HDL Example 4.4. The addi-             tion logic is described by a single statement using the operators of addition and concat-             enation. The plus symbol () specifies the binary addition of the four bits of A with the             four bits of B and the one bit of C_in. The target output is the concatenation of the             output carry C_out and the four bits of Sum. Concatenation of operands is expressed             within braces and a comma separating the operands. Thus, {C_out, Sum} represents the             five-bit result of the addition operation.

To show how dataflow descriptions facilitate digital design, con- sider the 4-bit magnitude comparator described in HDL Example 4.5. The module specifies two 4-bit inputs A and B and three outputs. One output (A_lt_B) is logic 1 if A is less than B, a second output (A_gt_B) is logic 1 if A is greater than B, and a third output (A_eq_B) is logic 1 if A is equal to B. Note that equality (identity) is symbolized with two equals signs ( ) to distinguish the operation from that of the assignment operator (). A Verilog HDL synthesis compiler can accept this module description as input, execute synthesis algorithms, and provide an output netlist and a schematic of a circuit equivalent to the one in Fig. 4.17, all without manual intervention! The designer need not draw the schematic. HDL Example 4.5 (Dataflow: Four-Bit Comparator) // Dataflow description of a four-bit comparator //V2001, 2005 syntax module mag_compare ( output            A_lt_B, A_eq_B, A_gt_B, input [3: 0]        A, B ); assign A_lt_B  (A  B); assign A_gt_B  (A  B); assign A_eq_B  (A   B); endmodule    The next example uses the conditional operator ( ? : ). This operator takes three operands:                            condition ? true-expression : false-expression; The condition is evaluated. If the result is logic 1, the true expression is evaluated and used to assign a value to the left-hand side of an assignment statement. If the result is logic 0, the false expression is evaluated. The two conditions together are equivalent to an ifCelse condition. HDL Example 4.6 describes a two-to-one-line multiplexer using the conditional operator. The continuous assignment                                     assign OUT  select ? A : B; specifies the condition that OUT  A if select  1, else OUT  B if select  0.

A : B; endmodule Behavioral Modeling             Behavioral modeling represents digital circuits at a functional and algorithmic level. It             is used mostly to describe sequential circuits, but can also be used to describe combina-             tional circuits. Here, we give two simple combinational circuit examples to introduce the             subject. Behavioral modeling is presented in more detail in Section 5.6, after the study             of sequential circuits.                 Behavioral descriptions use the keyword always, followed by an optional event con-             trol expression and a list of procedural assignment statements. The event control expres-             sion specifies when the statements will execute. The target output of a procedural             assignment statement must be of the reg data type. Contrary to the wire data type,             whereby the target output of an assignment may be continuously updated, a reg data             type retains its value until a new value is assigned.                 HDL Example 4.7 shows the behavioral description of a two-to-one-line multiplexer.             (Compare it with HDL Example 4.6.) Since variable m_out is a target output, it must             be declared as reg data (in addition to the output declaration). The procedural assign-             ment statements inside the always block are executed every time there is a change in             any of the variables listed after the @ symbol. (Note that there is no semicolon (;) at the             end of the always statement.) In this case, these variables are the input variables A, B,             and select. The statements execute if A, B, or select changes value. Note that the keyword             or, instead of the bitwise logical OR operator |, is used between variables. The condi-             tional statement ifCelse provides a decision based upon the value of the select input. The             if statement can be written without the equality symbol:                                                        if (select) OUT  A;             The statement implies that select is checked for logic 1.              Section 4.12 HDL Models of Combinational Circuits 175     HDL Example 4.7 (Behavioral: Two-to-One Line Multiplexer)     // Behavioral description of two-to-one-line multiplexer     module mux_2x1_beh (m_out, A, B, select);     output               m_out;     input                A, B, select;     reg                  m_out;     always               @(A or B or select)            if (select  1) m_out  A;            else m_out 5 B;     endmodule    HDL Example 4.8 describes the function of a four-to-one-line multiplexer. The select input is defined as a two-bit vector, and output y is declared to have type reg.The always statement, in this example, has a sequential block enclosed between the keywords case and endcase.The block is executed whenever any of the inputs listed after the @ symbol changes in value. The case statement is a multiway conditional branch construct. When- ever in_0, in_1, in_2, in_3 or select change, the case expression (select) is evaluated and its value compared, from top to bottom, with the values in the list of statements that follow, the so-called case items. The statement associated with the first case item that matches the case expression is executed. In the absence of a match, no statement is executed. Since select is a two-bit number, it can be equal to 00, 01, 10, or 11. The case items have an implied priority because the list is evaluated from top to bottom.    The list is called a sensitivity list (Verilog 2001, 2005) and is equivalent to the event control expression (Verilog 1995) formed by ORing the signals. Combinational logic is reactivewhen an input changes an output may change.             HDL Example 4.8 (Behavioral: Four-to-One Line Multiplexer) // Behavioral description of four-to-one line multiplexer // Verilog 2001, 2005 port syntax module mux_4x1_beh ( output reg m_out,     input    in_0, in_1, in_2, in_3,     input [1: 0] select ); always @ (in_0, in_1, in_2, in_3, select)     // Verilog 2001, 2005 syntax     case (select)     2b00:        m_out  in_0;     2b01:        m_out  in_1;     2b10:        m_out  in_2;     2b11:        m_out  in_3;     endcase endmodule                 Binary numbers in Verilog are specified and interpreted with the letter b preceded             by a prime. The size of the number is written first and then its value. Thus, 2b01 speci-             fies a two-bit binary number whose value is 01. Numbers are stored as a bit pattern in             memory, but they can be referenced in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal formats with the             letters do, and h, respectively. For example, 4HA  4d10  4b1010 and have the             same internal representation in a simulator. If the base of the number is not specified,             its interpretation defaults to decimal. If the size of the number is not specified, the             system assumes that the size of the number is at least 32 bits; if a host simulator has a             larger word lengthsay, 64 bitsthe language will use that value to store unsized             numbers. The integer data type (keyword integer) is stored in a 32-bit representation.             The underscore (_) may be inserted in a number to improve readability of the code             (e.g., 16b0101_1110_0101_0011). It has no other effect.                 The case construct has two important variations: casex and casez. The first will treat             as dont-cares any bits of the case expression or the case item that have logic value x or             z. The casez construct treats as dont-cares only the logic value z, for the purpose of             detecting a match between the case expression and a case item.                 The list of case items need not be complete. If the list of case items does not include             all possible bit patterns of the case expression, no match can be detected. Unlisted case             items, i.e., bit patterns that are not explicitly decoded can be treated by using the default             keyword as the last item in the list of case items. The associated statement will execute             when no other match is found. This feature is useful, for example, when there are more             possible state codes in a sequential machine than are actually used. Having a default             case item lets the designer map all of the unused states to a desired next state without             having to elaborate each individual state, rather than allowing the synthesis tool to             arbitrarily assign the next state.                 The examples of behavioral descriptions of combinational circuits shown here are             simple ones. Behavioral modeling and procedural assignment statements require knowl-             edge of sequential circuits and are covered in more detail in Section 5.6. Writing a Simple Test Bench             A test bench is an HDL program used for describing and applying a stimulus to an HDL             model of a circuit in order to test it and observe its response during simulation. Test             benches can be quite complex and lengthy and may take longer to develop than the             design that is tested. The results of a test are only as good as the test bench that is used             to test a circuit. Care must be taken to write stimuli that will test a circuit thoroughly,             exercising all of the operating features that are specified. However, the test benches             considered here are relatively simple, since the circuits we want to test implement only             combinational logic. The examples are presented to demonstrate some basic features of             HDL stimulus modules. Chapter 8 considers test benches in greater depth.                 In addition to employing the always statement, test benches use the initial statement             to provide a stimulus to the circuit being tested. We use the term always statement             loosely. Actually, always is a Verilog language construct specifying how the associated             statement is to execute (subject to the event control expression). The always statement                           Section 4.12 HDL Models of Combinational Circuits 177 executes repeatedly in a loop. The initial statement executes only once, starting from simulation time 0, and may continue with any operations that are delayed by a given number of time units, as specified by the symbol #. For example, consider the initial block     initial       begin               A  0; B  0;          #10 A  1;          #20 A  0; B  1;       end The block is enclosed between the keywords begin and end. At time 0, A and B are set to 0. Ten time units later, A is changed to 1. Twenty time units after that (at t  30), A is changed to 0 and B to 1. Inputs specified by a three-bit truth table can be generated with the initial block:    initial      begin         D  3b000;         repeat (7)         #10 D  D  3b001;      end When the simulator runs, the three-bit vector D is initialized to 000 at time  0. The keyword repeat specifies a looping statement: D is incremented by 1 seven times, once every 10 time units. The result is a sequence of binary numbers from 000 to 111.    A stimulus module has the following form:      module test_module_name;         // Declare local reg and wire identifiers.         // Instantiate the design module under test.         // Specify a stopwatch, using $finish to terminate the simulation.         // Generate stimulus, using initial and always statements.         // Display the output response (text or graphics (or both)).      endmodule A test module is written like any other module, but it typically has no inputs or outputs. The signals that are applied as inputs to the design module for simulation are declared in the stimulus module as local reg data type. The outputs of the design module that are displayed for testing are declared in the stimulus module as local wire data type. The module under test is then instantiated, using the local identifiers in its port list. Figure 4.34 clarifies this relationship. The stimulus module generates inputs for the design module by declaring local identifiers t_A and t_B as reg type and checks the output of the design unit with the wire identifier t_C. The local identifiers are then used to instantiate the design module being tested. The simulator associates the (actual) local identifiers within the test bench, t_A, t_B, and t_C, with the formal identifiers of the module t_circuit;                  module circuit ( C , A, B )   reg t_A, t_B;   wire t_C;                                      input   A, B;   parameter stop_time  1000 ;                                                  output  C;  circuit M ( t_C, t_A, t_B );                                    // Description goes here // Stimulus generators for         endmodule // t_A and t_B go here   initial # stop_time $finish; endmodule FIGURE 4.34 Interaction between stimulus and design modules module (A, B, C). The association shown here is based on position in the port list, which is adequate for the examples that we will consider. The reader should note, however, that Verilog provides a more flexible name association mechanism for connecting ports in larger circuits.    The response to the stimulus generated by the initial and always blocks will appear in text format as standard output and as waveforms (timing diagrams) in simulators having graphical output capability. Numerical outputs are displayed by using Verilog system tasks. These are built-in system functions that are recognized by keywords that begin with the symbol $. Some of the system tasks that are useful for display are         $displaydisplay a one-time value of variables or strings with an end-of-line return,         $writesame as $display, but without going to next line,         $monitordisplay variables whenever a value changes during a simulation run,         $timedisplay the simulation time,         $finishterminate the simulation.    The syntax for $display, $write, and $monitor is of the form                          Task-name ( format specification, argumentlist); The format specification uses the symbol % to specify the radix of the numbers that are displayed and may have a string enclosed in quotes (). The base may be binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or octal, identified with the symbols %b, %d, %h, and %o, respectively (%B, %D, %H, and %O are valid too). For example, the statement                                     $display (\"%d %b %b\", C, A, B); specifies the display of C in decimal and of A and B in binary. Note that there are no commas in the format specification, that the format specification and argument list                           Section 4.12 HDL Models of Combinational Circuits 179 are separated by a comma, and that the argument list has commas between the variables. An example that specifies a string enclosed in quotes may look like the statement                           $display (\"time  %0d A  %b\", $time, A, B); and will produce the display time  3 A  10 B  1 where (time  ), (A  ), and (B  ) are part of the string to be displayed. The format specifiers %0d, %b, and %b specify the base for $time, A, and B, respectively. In display- ing time values, it is better to use the format %0d instead of %d. This provides a display of the significant digits without the leading spaces that %d will include. (%d will display about 10 leading spaces because time is calculated as a 32-bit number.)    An example of a stimulus module is shown in HDL Example 4.9. The circuit to be tested is the two-to-one-line multiplexer described in Example 4.6. The module t_mux_2x1_df has no ports. The inputs for the mux are declared with a reg keyword and the outputs with a wire keyword. The mux is instantiated with the local variables. The initial block specifies a sequence of binary values to be applied during the simulation. The output response is checked with the $monitor system task. Every time a variable in its argument changes value, the simulator displays the inputs, output, and time. The result of the simulation is listed under the simulation log in the example. It shows that m_out  A when select  1 and m_out  B when select  0 verifying the operation of the multiplexer.

There are two types of verification: functional and timing. In functional verification, we study the circuit logical operation indepen- dently of timing considerations. This can be done by deriving the truth table of the combinational circuit. In timing verification, we study the circuits operation by including the effect of delays through the gates. This can be done by observing the waveforms at the outputs of the gates when they respond to a given input. An exam- ple of a circuit with gate delays was presented in Section 3.10 in HDL Example 3.3. We next show an HDL example that produces the truth table of a combinational circuit. A $monitor system task displays the output caused by the given stimulus. A commented alternative statement having a $display task would create a header that could be used with a $monitor statement to eliminate the repetition of names on each line of output.    The analysis of combinational circuits was covered in Section 4.3. A multilevel circuit of a full adder was analyzed, and its truth table was derived by inspection. The gate-level description of this circuit is shown in HDL Example 4.10. The circuit has three inputs, two outputs, and nine gates. The description of the circuit follows the interconnections between the gates according to the schematic diagram of Fig. 4.2. The stimulus for the circuit is listed in the second module. The inputs for simulating the circuit are specified with a three-bit reg vector D. D[2] is equivalent to input A, D[1] to input B, and D[0] to input C. The outputs of the circuit F1 and F2 are declared as wire. The complement of F2 is named F2_b to illustrate a common industry practice for designating the complement of a signal (instead of appending _not). This procedure                           Section 4.12 HDL Models of Combinational Circuits 181 follows the steps outlined in Fig. 4.34. The repeat loop provides the seven binary num- bers after 000 for the truth table. The result of the simulation generates the output truth table displayed with the example. The truth table listed shows that the circuit is a full adder.

The       technology enabling and supporting these devices is critically dependent on electronic       components that can store information, i.e., have memory. This chapter examines the       operation and control of these devices and their use in circuits and enables you to better       understand what is happening in these devices when you interact with them. The digital       circuits considered thus far have been combinationaltheir output depends only and       immediately on their inputsthey have no memory, i.e., dependence on past values of       their inputs. Sequential circuits, however, act as storage elements and have memory. They       can store, retain, and then retrieve information when needed at a later time. Our treatment       will distinguish sequential logic from combinational logic. 5.2  SEQUENTIAL CIRCUITS       A block diagram of a sequential circuit is shown in Fig. 5.1. It consists of a combinational       circuit to which storage elements are connected to form a feedback path. The storage       elements are devices capable of storing binary information. The binary information       stored in these elements at any given time defines the state of the sequential circuit at       that time. The sequential circuit receives binary information from external inputs that,       together with the present state of the storage elements, determine the binary value of       the outputs. These external inputs also determine the condition for changing the state 190                                      Section 5.2 Sequential Circuits 191 Inputs                                         Outputs         Combinational                Memory              circuit                 elements FIGURE 5.1 Block diagram of sequential circuit in the storage elements. The block diagram demonstrates that the outputs in a sequen- tial circuit are a function not only of the inputs, but also of the present state of the stor- age elements. The next state of the storage elements is also a function of external inputs and the present state. Thus, a sequential circuit is specified by a time sequence of inputs, outputs, and internal states. In contrast, the outputs of combinational logic depend only on the present values of the inputs.    There are two main types of sequential circuits, and their classification is a function of the timing of their signals. A synchronous sequential circuit is a system whose behavior can be defined from the knowledge of its signals at discrete instants of time. The behavior of an asynchronous sequential circuit depends upon the input signals at any instant of time and the order in which the inputs change. The storage elements commonly used in asyn- chronous sequential circuits are time-delay devices. The storage capability of a time-delay device varies with the time it takes for the signal to propagate through the device. In prac- tice, the internal propagation delay of logic gates is of sufficient duration to produce the needed delay, so that actual delay units may not be necessary. In gate-type asynchronous systems, the storage elements consist of logic gates whose propagation delay provides the required storage. Thus, an asynchronous sequential circuit may be regarded as a combina- tional circuit with feedback. Because of the feedback among logic gates, an asynchronous sequential circuit may become unstable at times. The instability problem imposes many difficulties on the designer. These circuits will not be covered in this text.    A synchronous sequential circuit employs signals that affect the storage elements at only discrete instants of time. Synchronization is achieved by a timing device called a clock generator, which provides a clock signal having the form of a periodic train of clock pulses. The clock signal is commonly denoted by the identifiers clock and clk. The clock pulses are distributed throughout the system in such a way that storage elements are affected only with the arrival of each pulse. In practice, the clock pulses determine when computational activity will occur within the circuit, and other signals (external inputs and otherwise) determine what changes will take place affecting the storage elements and the outputs. For example, a circuit that is to add and store two binary numbers would compute their sum from the values of the numbers and store the sum at the occurrence of a clock pulse. Synchronous sequential circuits that use clock pulses to control storage elements are called clocked sequential circuits and are the type most frequently encoun- tered in practice. They are called synchronous circuits because the activity within the circuit and the resulting updating of stored values is synchronized to the occurrence of Inputs                                                  Outputs         Combinational              circuit                                             Flip-flops         Clock pulses                       (a) Block diagram                                                (b) Timing diagram of clock pulses     FIGURE 5.2     Synchronous clocked sequential circuit clock pulses. The design of synchronous circuits is feasible because they seldom manifest instability problems and their timing is easily broken down into independent discrete steps, each of which can be considered separately.    The storage elements (memory) used in clocked sequential circuits are called flip- flops. A flip-flop is a binary storage device capable of storing one bit of information. In a stable state, the output of a flip-flop is either 0 or 1. A sequential circuit may use many flip-flops to store as many bits as necessary. The block diagram of a synchronous clocked sequential circuit is shown in Fig. 5.2. The outputs are formed by a combinational logic function of the inputs to the circuit or the values stored in the flip-flops (or both). The value that is stored in a flip-flop when the clock pulse occurs is also determined by the inputs to the circuit or the values presently stored in the flip-flop (or both). The new value is stored (i.e., the flip-flop is updated) when a pulse of the clock signal occurs. Prior to the occurrence of the clock pulse, the combinational logic forming the next value of the flip-flop must have reached a stable value. Consequently, the speed at which the combinational logic circuits operate is critical. If the clock (synchronizing) pulses arrive at a regular interval, as shown in the timing diagram in Fig. 5.2, the com- binational logic must respond to a change in the state of the flip-flop in time to be updated before the next pulse arrives. Propagation delays play an important role in determining the minimum interval between clock pulses that will allow the circuit to operate correctly. A change in state of the flip-flops is initiated only by a clock pulse transitionfor example, when the value of the clock signals changes from 0 to 1. When a clock pulse is not active, the feedback loop between the value stored in the flip-flop and the value formed at the input to the flip-flop is effectively broken because the flip- flop outputs cannot change even if the outputs of the combinational circuit driving their inputs change in value. Thus, the transition from one state to the next occurs only at predetermined intervals dictated by the clock pulses. 5.3                                                Section 5.3 Storage Elements: Latches 193      STORAGE ELEMENTS: LATCHES       A storage element in a digital circuit can maintain a binary state indefinitely (as long       as power is delivered to the circuit), until directed by an input signal to switch states.       The major differences among various types of storage elements are in the number of       inputs they possess and in the manner in which the inputs affect the binary state. Storage       elements that operate with signal levels (rather than signal transitions) are referred to as       latches; those controlled by a clock transition are flip-flops. Latches are said to be level       sensitive devices; flip-flops are edge-sensitive devices. The two types of storage elements       are related because latches are the basic circuits from which all flip-flops are con-       structed. Although latches are useful for storing binary information and for the design       of asynchronous sequential circuits, they are not practical for use as storage elements       in synchronous sequential circuits. Because they are the building blocks of flip-flops,       however, we will consider the fundamental storage mechanism used in latches before       considering flip-flops in the next section. SR Latch             The SR latch is a circuit with two cross-coupled NOR gates or two cross-coupled NAND             gates, and two inputs labeled S for set and R for reset. The SR latch constructed with two             cross-coupled NOR gates is shown in Fig. 5.3.The latch has two useful states.When output             Q = 1 and Q = 0, the latch is said to be in the set state. When Q = 0 and Q = 1, it is             in the reset state. Outputs Q and Q are normally the complement of each other. However,             when both inputs are equal to 1 at the same time, a condition in which both outputs are             equal to 0 (rather than be mutually complementary) occurs. If both inputs are then switched             to 0 simultaneously, the device will enter an unpredictable or undefined state or a meta-             stable state. Consequently, in practical applications, setting both inputs to 1 is forbidden.                 Under normal conditions, both inputs of the latch remain at 0 unless the state has to be             changed. The application of a momentary 1 to the S input causes the latch to go to the set             state. The S input must go back to 0 before any other changes take place, in order to avoid             the occurrence of an undefined next state that results from the forbidden input condition.             As shown in the function table of Fig. 5.3(b), two input conditions cause the circuit to be in      1      0  R (reset)                S R Q Q                               Q 10 10                                  0 0 1 0 (after S  1, R  0)      1                           01 01                               Q  0 0 0 1 (after S  0, R  1)      0  S (set)                  1 1 0 0 (forbidden)         (a) Logic diagram        (b) Function table      FIGURE 5.3      SR latch with NOR gates 1 0  S (set)                                  Q  S R Q Q 1                                              10 01                                                1 1 0 1 (after S  1, R  0) 0  R (reset)                                Q  01 10                                                1 1 1 0 (after S  0, R  1)    (a) Logic diagram                           0 0 1 1 (forbidden)                                                (b) Function table FIGURE 5.4 SR latch with NAND gates the set state. The first condition (S = 1, R = 0) is the action that must be taken by input S to bring the circuit to the set state. Removing the active input from S leaves the circuit in the same state. After both inputs return to 0, it is then possible to shift to the reset state by momentary applying a 1 to the R input. The 1 can then be removed from R, whereupon the circuit remains in the reset state. Thus, when both inputs S and R are equal to 0, the latch can be in either the set or the reset state, depending on which input was most recently a 1.    If a 1 is applied to both the S and R inputs of the latch, both outputs go to 0. This action produces an undefined next state, because the state that results from the input transitions depends on the order in which they return to 0. It also violates the require- ment that outputs be the complement of each other. In normal operation, this condition is avoided by making sure that 1s are not applied to both inputs simultaneously.    The SR latch with two cross-coupled NAND gates is shown in Fig. 5.4. It operates with both inputs normally at 1, unless the state of the latch has to be changed. The application of 0 to the S input causes output Q to go to 1, putting the latch in the set state. When the S input goes back to 1, the circuit remains in the set state. After both inputs go back to 1, we are allowed to change the state of the latch by placing a 0 in the R input. This action causes the circuit to go to the reset state and stay there even after both inputs return to 1. The condition that is forbidden for the NAND latch is both inputs being equal to 0 at the same time, an input combination that should be avoided.    In comparing the NAND with the NOR latch, note that the input signals for the NAND require the complement of those values used for the NOR latch. Because the NAND latch requires a 0 signal to change its state, it is sometimes referred to as an SR latch. The primes (or, sometimes, bars over the letters) designate the fact that the inputs must be in their complement form to activate the circuit.    The operation of the basic SR latch can be modified by providing an additional input signal that determines (controls) when the state of the latch can be changed by determining whether S and R (or S and R) can affect the circuit. An SR latch with a control input is shown in Fig. 5.5. It consists of the basic SR latch and two additional NAND gates. The control input En acts as an enable signal for the other two inputs. The outputs of the NAND gates stay at the logic-1 level as long as the enable signal remains at 0. This is the quiescent condition for the SR latch. When the enable input goes to 1, information from the S or R input is allowed to affect the latch.The set state is reached with S = 1, R = 0, and En = 1                                                     Section 5.3 Storage Elements: Latches 195 S                                                   Q                                                                         En S R Next state of Q En                                                        0 X X No change R                                  (a) Logic diagram     1 0 0 No change              FIGURE 5.5                                1 0 1 Q  0; reset state              SR latch with control input                                                     Q  1 1 0 Q  1; set state                                                        1 1 1 Indeterminate                                                        (b) Function table (active-high enabled). To change to the reset state, the inputs must be S = 0, R = 1, and En = 1. In either case, when En returns to 0, the circuit remains in its current state. The control input disables the circuit by applying 0 to En, so that the state of the output does not change regardless of the values of S and R. Moreover, when En = 1 and both the S and R inputs are equal to 0, the state of the circuit does not change. These conditions are listed in the function table accompanying the diagram.    An indeterminate condition occurs when all three inputs are equal to 1. This condition places 0s on both inputs of the basic SR latch, which puts it in the undefined state. When the enable input goes back to 0, one cannot conclusively determine the next state, because it depends on whether the S or R input goes to 0 first. This indeterminate condition makes this circuit difficult to manage, and it is seldom used in practice. Nevertheless, the SR latch is an important circuit because other useful latches and flip-flops are constructed from it. D Latch (Transparent Latch)             One way to eliminate the undesirable condition of the indeterminate state in the SR             latch is to ensure that inputs S and R are never equal to 1 at the same time. This is             done in the D latch, shown in Fig. 5.6. This latch has only two inputs: D (data) and D                                                                                                        Q                                                                                                                      En D Next state of Q En                                                                                                                       0 X No change                                                                                                                       1 0 Q  0; reset state                                                                                                                       1 1 Q  1; set state                                                                                                        Q             (a) Logic diagram                          (b) Function table FIGURE 5.6 D latch      S                            S         D                R                  R         En                                        SR        D                     SR      FIGURE 5.7      Graphic symbols for latches      En (enable). The D input goes directly to the S input, and its complement is applied      to the R input. As long as the enable input is at 0, the cross-coupled SR latch has both      inputs at the 1 level and the circuit cannot change state regardless of the value of D.      The D input is sampled when En = 1. If D = 1, the Q output goes to 1, placing the      circuit in the set state. If D = 0, output Q goes to 0, placing the circuit in the reset      state.         The D latch receives that designation from its ability to hold data in its internal stor-      age. It is suited for use as a temporary storage for binary information between a unit      and its environment. The binary information present at the data input of the D latch is      transferred to the Q output when the enable input is asserted. The output follows      changes in the data input as long as the enable input is asserted. This situation provides      a path from input D to the output, and for this reason, the circuit is often called a trans-      parent latch. When the enable input signal is de-asserted, the binary information that      was present at the data input at the time the transition occurred is retained (i.e., stored)      at the Q output until the enable input is asserted again. Note that an inverter could be      placed at the enable input. Then, depending on the physical circuit, the external enabling      signal will be a value of 0 (active low) or 1 (active high).         The graphic symbols for the various latches are shown in Fig. 5.7.A latch is designated      by a rectangular block with inputs on the left and outputs on the right. One output      designates the normal output, and the other (with the bubble designation) designates      the complement output. The graphic symbol for the SR latch has inputs S and R indi-      cated inside the block. In the case of a NAND gate latch, bubbles are added to the inputs      to indicate that setting and resetting occur with a logic-0 signal. The graphic symbol for      the D latch has inputs D and En indicated inside the block. 5.4  STORAGE ELEMENTS: FLIP-FLOPS       The state of a latch or flip-flop is switched by a change in the control input. This momentary       change is called a trigger, and the transition it causes is said to trigger the flip-flop. The D       latch with pulses in its control input is essentially a flip-flop that is triggered every time the       pulse goes to the logic-1 level. As long as the pulse input remains at this level, any changes       in the data input will change the output and the state of the latch.                                           Section 5.4 Storage Elements: Flip-Flops 197    As seen from the block diagram of Fig. 5.2, a sequential circuit has a feedback path from the outputs of the flip-flops to the input of the combinational circuit. Conse- quently, the inputs of the flip-flops are derived in part from the outputs of the same and other flip-flops. When latches are used for the storage elements, a serious difficulty arises. The state transitions of the latches start as soon as the clock pulse changes to the logic-1 level. The new state of a latch appears at the output while the pulse is still active. This output is connected to the inputs of the latches through the combinational circuit. If the inputs applied to the latches change while the clock pulse is still at the logic-1 level, the latches will respond to new values and a new output state may occur. The result is an unpredictable situation, since the state of the latches may keep changing for as long as the clock pulse stays at the active level. Because of this unreliable operation, the output of a latch cannot be applied directly or through combinational logic to the input of the same or another latch when all the latches are triggered by a common clock source.    Flip-flop circuits are constructed in such a way as to make them operate properly when they are part of a sequential circuit that employs a common clock. The problem with the latch is that it responds to a change in the level of a clock pulse. As shown in Fig. 5.8(a), a positive level response in the enable input allows changes in the output when the D input changes while the clock pulse stays at logic 1. The key to the proper operation of a flip-flop is to trigger it only during a signal transition. This can be accom- plished by eliminating the feedback path that is inherent in the operation of the sequen- tial circuit using latches. A clock pulse goes through two transitions: from 0 to 1 and the return from 1 to 0. As shown in Fig. 5.8, the positive transition is defined as the positive edge and the negative transition as the negative edge. There are two ways that a latch can be modified to form a flip-flop. One way is to employ two latches in a special con- figuration that isolates the output of the flip-flop and prevents it from being affected while the input to the flip-flop is changing. Another way is to produce a flip-flop that                                                    (a) Response to positive level                                                      (b) Positive-edge response                                                     (c) Negative-edge response     FIGURE 5.8     Clock response in latch and flip-flop             triggers only during a signal transition (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) of the synchronizing             signal (clock) and is disabled during the rest of the clock pulse. We will now proceed to             show the implementation of both types of flip-flops. Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop             The construction of a D flip-flop with two D latches and an inverter is shown in Fig. 5.9.             The first latch is called the master and the second the slave. The circuit samples the D             input and changes its output Q only at the negative edge of the synchronizing or control-             ling clock (designated as Clk). When the clock is 0, the output of the inverter is 1. The             slave latch is enabled, and its output Q is equal to the master output Y. The master latch             is disabled because Clk = 0. When the input pulse changes to the logic-1 level, the data             from the external D input are transferred to the master. The slave, however, is disabled             as long as the clock remains at the 1 level, because its enable input is equal to 0. Any             change in the input changes the master output at Y, but cannot affect the slave output.             When the clock pulse returns to 0, the master is disabled and is isolated from the D             input. At the same time, the slave is enabled and the value of Y is transferred to the             output of the flip-flop at Q. Thus, a change in the output of the flip-flop can be triggered             only by and during the transition of the clock from 1 to 0.                 The behavior of the masterCslave flip-flop just described dictates that (1) the output             may change only once, (2) a change in the output is triggered by the negative edge of             the clock, and (3) the change may occur only during the clocks negative level. The value             that is produced at the output of the flip-flop is the value that was stored in the master             stage immediately before the negative edge occurred. It is also possible to design the             circuit so that the flip-flop output changes on the positive edge of the clock. This hap-             pens in a flip-flop that has an additional inverter between the Clk terminal and the             junction between the other inverter and input En of the master latch. Such a flip-flop is             triggered with a negative pulse, so that the negative edge of the clock affects the master             and the positive edge affects the slave and the output terminal.                 Another construction of an edge-triggered D flip-flop uses three SR latches as shown             in Fig. 5.10. Two latches respond to the external D (data) and Clk (clock) inputs. The             third latch provides the outputs for the flip-flop.

This causes the output to remain in its present state. Input D may be equal to 0 or 1. If D = 0 when Clk becomes 1, R changes to 0. This causes the flip-flop to go to the reset state, making Q = 0. If there is a change in the D input while Clk = 1, terminal R remains at 0 because Q is 0.Thus, the flip-flop is locked out and is unresponsive to further changes in the input. When the clock returns to 0, R goes to 1, placing the output latch in the quiescent condition with- out changing the output. Similarly, if D = 1 when Clk goes from 0 to 1, S changes to 0. This causes the circuit to go to the set state, making Q = 1. Any change in D while Clk = 1 does not affect the output.    In sum, when the input clock in the positive-edge-triggered flip-flop makes a positive transition, the value of D is transferred to Q.A negative transition of the clock (i.e., from 1 to 0) does not affect the output, nor is the output affected by changes in D when Clk is in the steady logic-1 level or the logic-0 level. Hence, this type of flip-flop responds to the transition from 0 to 1 and nothing else.    The timing of the response of a flip-flop to input data and to the clock must be taken into consideration when one is using edge-triggered flip-flops. There is a minimum time called the setup time during which the D input must be maintained at a constant value prior to the occurrence of the clock transition. Similarly, there is a minimum time called the hold time during which the D input must not change after the application of the positive transi- tion of the clock. The propagation delay time of the flip-flop is defined as the interval between the trigger edge and the stabilization of the output to a new state. These and other parameters are specified in manufacturers data books for specific logic families.

It is simi- lar to the symbol used for the D latch, except for the arrowhead-like symbol in front of the letter Clk, designating a dynamic input. The dynamic indicator (>) denotes the fact that the flip-flop responds to the edge transition of the clock. A bubble outside the block adjacent to the dynamic indicator designates a negative edge for triggering the circuit. The absence of a bubble designates a positive-edge response. Other Flip-Flops             Very large-scale integration circuits contain several thousands of gates within one pack-             age. Circuits are constructed by interconnecting the various gates to provide a digital             system. Each flip-flop is constructed from an interconnection of gates. The most eco-             nomical and efficient flip-flop constructed in this manner is the edge-triggered D flip-             flop, because it requires the smallest number of gates. Other types of flip-flops can be             constructed by using the D flip-flop and external logic. Two flip-flops less widely used             in the design of digital systems are the JK and T flip-flops.                 There are three operations that can be performed with a flip-flop: Set it to 1, reset it             to 0, or complement its output. With only a single input, the D flip-flop can set or reset             the output, depending on the value of the D input immediately before the clock transi-             tion. Synchronized by a clock signal, the JK flip-flop has two inputs and performs all             three operations. The circuit diagram of a JK flip-flop constructed with a D flip-flop and             gates is shown in Fig. 5.12(a). The J input sets the flip-flop to 1, the K input resets it to             0, and when both inputs are enabled, the output is complemented. This can be verified             by investigating the circuit applied to the D input:                                                          D = JQ + KQ             When J = 1 and K = 0, D = Q + Q = 1, so the next clock edge sets the output to 1.             When J = 0 and K = 1, D = 0, so the next clock edge resets the output to 0. When             both J = K = 1 and D = Q, the next clock edge complements the output.When both             J = K = 0 and D = Q, the clock edge leaves the output unchanged. The graphic sym-             bol for the JK flip-flop is shown in Fig. 5.12(b). It is similar to the graphic symbol of the             D flip-flop, except that now the inputs are marked J and K.                 The T (toggle) flip-flop is a complementing flip-flop and can be obtained from a JK             flip-flop when inputs J and K are tied together. This is shown in Fig. 5.13(a).

When T = 1, D = Q and       the output complements. The graphic symbol for this flip-flop has a T symbol in the input. Characteristic Tables             A characteristic table defines the logical properties of a flip-flop by describing its oper-             ation in tabular form. The characteristic tables of three types of flip-flops are presented             in Table 5.1.They define the next state (i.e., the state that results from a clock transition)      Table 5.1      Flip-Flop Characteristic Tables              JK Flip-Flop              J K Q(t  1)              0 0 Q(t)                       No change              0 10                           Reset              1 01                           Set              1 1 Q(t)                       Complement D Flip-Flop                T Flip-Flop D Q(t  1)                  T Q(t  1) 0 0          Reset         0                Q ( t )     No change 1 1          Set                                        Complement                            1                Q(t) as a function of the inputs and the present state. Q(t) refers to the present state (i.e., the state present prior to the application of a clock edge). Q(t + 1) is the next state one clock period later. Note that the clock edge input is not included in the characteristic table, but is implied to occur between times t and t + 1. Thus, Q(t) denotes the state of the flip-flop immediately before the clock edge, and Q(t + 1) denotes the state that results from the clock transition.    The characteristic table for the JK flip-flop shows that the next state is equal to the present state when inputs J and K are both equal to 0. This condition can be expressed as Q(t + 1) = Q(t), indicating that the clock produces no change of state.When K = 1 and J = 0, the clock resets the flip-flop and Q(t + 1) = 0. With J = 1 and K = 0, the flip-flop sets and Q(t + 1) = 1. When both J and K are equal to 1, the next state changes to the complement of the present state, a transition that can be expressed as Q(t + 1) = Q(t).    The next state of a D flip-flop is dependent only on the D input and is independent of the present state.This can be expressed as Q(t + 1) = D. It means that the next-state value is equal to the value of D. Note that the D flip-flop does not have a no-change condition. Such a condition can be accomplished either by disabling the clock or by operating the clock by having the output of the flip-flop connected into the D input. Either method effectively circulates the output of the flip-flop when the state of the flip-flop must remain unchanged.    The characteristic table of the T flip-flop has only two conditions: When T = 0, the clock edge does not change the state; when T = 1, the clock edge complements the state of the flip-flop.                                                        Section 5.4 Storage Elements: Flip-Flops 203 Characteristic Equations             The logical properties of a flip-flop, as described in the characteristic table, can be             expressed algebraically with a characteristic equation. For the D flip-flop, we have the             characteristic equation                                                            Q(t + 1) = D             which states that the next state of the output will be equal to the value of input D in the             present state. The characteristic equation for the JK flip-flop can be derived from the             characteristic table or from the circuit of Fig. 5.12. We obtain                                                      Q(t + 1) = JQ + KQ             where Q is the value of the flip-flop output prior to the application of a clock edge. The             characteristic equation for the T flip-flop is obtained from the circuit of Fig. 5.13:                                               Q(t + 1) = T { Q = TQ + TQ Direct Inputs             Some flip-flops have asynchronous inputs that are used to force the flip-flop to a par-             ticular state independently of the clock. The input that sets the flip-flop to 1 is called             preset or direct set. The input that clears the flip-flop to 0 is called clear or direct reset.             When power is turned on in a digital system, the state of the flip-flops is unknown. The             direct inputs are useful for bringing all flip-flops in the system to a known starting state             prior to the clocked operation.                 A positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop with active-low asynchronous reset is shown             in Fig. 5.14. The circuit diagram is the same as the one in Fig. 5.10, except for the             additional reset input connections to three NAND gates. When the reset input is 0,             it forces output Q to stay at 1, which, in turn, clears output Q to 0, thus resetting the             flip-flop. Two other connections from the reset input ensure that the S input of the             third SR latch stays at logic 1 while the reset input is at 0, regardless of the values of             D and Clk.                 The graphic symbol for the D flip-flop with a direct reset has an additional input             marked with R. The bubble along the input indicates that the reset is active at the logic-0             level. Flip-flops with a direct set use the symbol S for the asynchronous set input.                 The function table specifies the operation of the circuit. When R = 0, the output             is reset to 0. This state is independent of the values of D or Clk. Normal clock opera-             tion can proceed only after the reset input goes to logic 1. The clock at Clk is shown             with an upward arrow to indicate that the flip-flop triggers on the positive edge of             the clock. The value in D is transferred to Q with every positive-edge clock signal,             provided that R = 1.

The       behavior of a clocked sequential circuit is determined from the inputs, the outputs, and       the state of its flip-flops. The outputs and the next state are both a function of the inputs       and the present state. The analysis of a sequential circuit consists of obtaining a table or       a diagram for the time sequence of inputs, outputs, and internal states. It is also possible                                         Section 5.5 Analysis of Clocked Sequential Circuits 205             to write Boolean expressions that describe the behavior of the sequential circuit. These             expressions must include the necessary time sequence, either directly or indirectly.                 A logic diagram is recognized as a clocked sequential circuit if it includes flip-flops             with clock inputs. The flip-flops may be of any type, and the logic diagram may or may             not include combinational logic gates. In this section, we introduce an algebraic repre-             sentation for specifying the next-state condition in terms of the present state and inputs.             A state table and state diagram are then presented to describe the behavior of the             sequential circuit. Another algebraic representation is introduced for specifying the logic             diagram of sequential circuits. Examples are used to illustrate the various procedures. State Equations             The behavior of a clocked sequential circuit can be described algebraically by means of             state equations. A state equation (also called a transition equation) specifies the next             state as a function of the present state and inputs. Consider the sequential circuit shown             in Fig. 5.15. We will later show that it acts as a 0-detector by asserting its output when a                                                                                                                                      x x                                D  A                                   Clk                                                          A                                                                         y                                D  B                                              Clk                                                                      B                                Clock                                   y FIGURE 5.15 Example of sequential circuit             0 is detected in a stream of 1s. It consists of two D flip-flops A and B, an input x and an             output y. Since the D input of a flip-flop determines the value of the next state (i.e., the             state reached after the clock transition), it is possible to write a set of state equations             for the circuit:                                                 A(t + 1) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)x(t)                                                 B(t + 1) = A(t)x(t)             A state equation is an algebraic expression that specifies the condition for a flip-flop             state transition. The left side of the equation, with (t + 1), denotes the next state of the             flip-flop one clock edge later. The right side of the equation is a Boolean expression that             specifies the present state and input conditions that make the next state equal to 1. Since             all the variables in the Boolean expressions are a function of the present state, we can             omit the designation (t) after each variable for convenience and can express the state             equations in the more compact form                                                        A(t + 1) - Ax + Bx                                                       B(t + 1) - Ax             The Boolean expressions for the state equations can be derived directly from the gates             that form the combinational circuit part of the sequential circuit, since the D values of             the combinational circuit determine the next state. Similarly, the present-state value of             the output can be expressed algebraically as                                                     y(t) = [A(t) + B(t)]x(t)             By removing the symbol (t) for the present state, we obtain the output Boolean equation:                                                           y = (A + B)x State Table             The time sequence of inputs, outputs, and flip-flop states can be enumerated in a state             table (sometimes called a transition table). The state table for the circuit of Fig. 5.15 is             shown in Table 5.2. The table consists of four sections labeled present state, input, next             state, and output. The present-state section shows the states of flip-flops A and B at             any given time t. The input section gives a value of x for each possible present state.             The next-state section shows the states of the flip-flops one clock cycle later, at time             t + 1. The output section gives the value of y at time t for each present state and input             condition.                 The derivation of a state table requires listing all possible binary combinations of             present states and inputs. In this case, we have eight binary combinations from 000 to             111. The next-state values are then determined from the logic diagram or from the state             equations. The next state of flip-flop A must satisfy the state equation                                                       A(t + 1) = Ax + Bx Section 5.5 Analysis of Clocked Sequential Circuits 207 Table 5.2 State Table for the Circuit of Fig. 5.15 Present  Input  Next                      Output  State          State                                               y A B      x      A B                           0                                               0 0 0      0      0 0                           1 0 0                                           0 0 1      1      0 1                           1 0 1                                           0 1 0      0      0 0                           1 1 0                                           0 1 1      1      1 1 1 1          0      0 0          1      1 0          0      0 0          1      1 0 The next-state section in the state table under column A has three 1s where the present state of A and input x are both equal to 1 or the present state of B and input x are both equal to 1. Similarly, the next state of flip-flop B is derived from the state equation                                              B(t + 1) = Ax and is equal to 1 when the present state of A is 0 and input x is equal to 1. The output column is derived from the output equation                                               y = Ax + Bx    The state table of a sequential circuit with D-type flip-flops is obtained by the same procedure outlined in the previous example. In general, a sequential circuit with m flip- flops and n inputs needs 2m+n rows in the state table.The binary numbers from 0 through 2m+n - 1 are listed under the present-state and input columns. The next-state section has m columns, one for each flip-flop. The binary values for the next state are derived directly from the state equations. The output section has as many columns as there are output variables. Its binary value is derived from the circuit or from the Boolean func- tion in the same manner as in a truth table.    It is sometimes convenient to express the state table in a slightly different form hav- ing only three sections: present state, next state, and output. The input conditions are enumerated under the next-state and output sections. The state table of Table 5.2 is repeated in Table 5.3 in this second form. For each present state, there are two possible next states and outputs, depending on the value of the input. One form may be prefer- able to the other, depending on the application. State Diagram             The information available in a state table can be represented graphically in the form             of a state diagram. In this type of diagram, a state is represented by a circle, and the             (clock-triggered) transitions between states are indicated by directed lines connecting Table 5.3 Second Form of the State Table Present          Next State                          Output  State        x=0 x=1                                                  x=0 x=1 A B           AB AB                                  y    y 0 0           00 01                                  0    0 0 1           00 11 1 0           00 10                                  1    0 1 1           00 10                                                      1    0                                                      1    0          0/0                               0/1       1/0               00                                 10          1/0      0/1                       0/1  1/0                                            1/0               01                                 11 FIGURE 5.16 State diagram of the circuit of Fig. 5.15 the circles. The state diagram of the sequential circuit of Fig. 5.15 is shown in Fig. 5.16. The state diagram provides the same information as the state table and is obtained directly from Table 5.2 or Table 5.3. The binary number inside each circle identifies the state of the flip-flops. The directed lines are labeled with two binary numbers separated by a slash. The input value during the present state is labeled first, and the number after the slash gives the output during the present state with the given input. (It is important to remember that the bit value listed for the output along the directed line occurs dur- ing the present state and with the indicated input, and has nothing to do with the transition to the next state.) For example, the directed line from state 00 to 01 is labeled 1/0, meaning that when the sequential circuit is in the present state 00 and the input is 1, the output is 0. After the next clock cycle, the circuit goes to the next state, 01. If the input changes to 0, then the output becomes 1, but if the input remains at 1, the output stays at 0. This information is obtained from the state diagram along the two directed lines emanating from the circle with state 01. A directed line connecting a circle with itself indicates that no change of state occurs.    The steps presented in this example are summarized below:                  Circuit diagram S Equations C State table S State diagram                                         Section 5.5 Analysis of Clocked Sequential Circuits 209             This sequence of steps begins with a structural representation of the circuit and proceeds             to an abstract representation of its behavior. An HDL model can be in the form of a             gate-level description or in the form of a behavioral description. It is important to note             that a gate-level approach requires that the designer understands how to select and             connect gates and flip-flops to form a circuit having a particular behavior. That under-             standing comes with experience. On the other hand, an approach based on behavioral             modeling does not require the designer to know how to invent a schematicthe designer             needs only to know how to describe behavior using the constructs of the HDL, because             the circuit is produced automatically by a synthesis tool. Therefore, one does not have             to accumulate years of experience in order to become a productive designer of digital             circuits; nor does one have to acquire an extensive background in electrical engineering.                 There is no difference between a state table and a state diagram, except in the manner             of representation. The state table is easier to derive from a given logic diagram and the             state equation. The state diagram follows directly from the state table. The state diagram             gives a pictorial view of state transitions and is the form more suitable for human interpre-             tation of the circuits operation. For example, the state diagram of Fig. 5.16 clearly shows             that, starting from state 00, the output is 0 as long as the input stays at 1. The first 0 input             after a string of 1s gives an output of 1 and transfers the circuit back to the initial state,             00. The machine represented by this state diagram acts to detect a zero in the bit stream             of data. It corresponds to the behavior of the circuit in Fig. 5.15. Other circuits that detect             a zero in a stream of data may have a simpler circuit diagram and state diagram. Flip-Flop Input Equations             The logic diagram of a sequential circuit consists of flip-flops and gates. The interconnec-             tions among the gates form a combinational circuit and may be specified algebraically             with Boolean expressions. The knowledge of the type of flip-flops and a list of the Bool-             ean expressions of the combinational circuit provide the information needed to draw the             logic diagram of the sequential circuit. The part of the combinational circuit that gener-             ates external outputs is described algebraically by a set of Boolean functions called             output equations.The part of the circuit that generates the inputs to flip-flops is described             algebraically by a set of Boolean functions called flip-flop input equations (or, sometimes,             excitation equations).We will adopt the convention of using the flip-flop input symbol to             denote the input equation variable and a subscript to designate the name of the flip-flop             output. For example, the following input equation specifies an OR gate with inputs x and             y connected to the D input of a flip-flop whose output is labeled with the symbol Q:                                                             DQ = x + y                 The sequential circuit of Fig. 5.15 consists of two D flip-flops A and B, an input x, and             an output y. The logic diagram of the circuit can be expressed algebraically with two             flip-flop input equations and an output equation:                                                          DA = Ax + Bx                                                          DB = Ax                                                             y = (A + B)x             The three equations provide the necessary information for drawing the logic diagram             of the sequential circuit. The symbol DA specifies a D flip-flop labeled A. DB specifies             a second D flip-flop labeled B. The Boolean expressions associated with these two vari-             ables and the expression for output y specify the combinational circuit part of the             sequential circuit.                 The flip-flop input equations constitute a convenient algebraic form for specifying             the logic diagram of a sequential circuit. They imply the type of flip-flop from the letter             symbol, and they fully specify the combinational circuit that drives the flip-flops. Note             that the expression for the input equation for a D flip-flop is identical to the expression             for the corresponding state equation. This is because of the characteristic equation that             equates the next state to the value of the D input: Q(t + 1) = DQ. Analysis with D Flip-Flops             We will summarize the procedure for analyzing a clocked sequential circuit with D flip-             flops by means of a simple example. The circuit we want to analyze is described by the             input equation                                                           DA = A { x { y             The DA symbol implies a D flip-flop with output A. The x and y variables are the inputs             to the circuit. No output equations are given, which implies that the output comes from             the output of the flip-flop. The logic diagram is obtained from the input equation and is             drawn in Fig. 5.17(a).                 The state table has one column for the present state of flip-flop A, two columns for             the two inputs, and one column for the next state of A. The binary numbers under Axy             are listed from 000 through 111 as shown in Fig. 5.17(b). The next-state values are             obtained from the state equation                                                       A(t + 1) = A { x { y             The expression specifies an odd function and is equal to 1 when only one variable is 1             or when all three variables are 1. This is indicated in the column for the next state of A.                 The circuit has one flip-flop and two states. The state diagram consists of two circles,             one for each state as shown in Fig. 5.17(c).The present state and the output can be either             0 or 1, as indicated by the number inside the circles. A slash on the directed lines is not             needed, because there is no output from a combinational circuit. The two inputs can             have four possible combinations for each state. Two input combinations during each             state transition are separated by a comma to simplify the notation. Analysis with JK Flip-Flops             A state table consists of four sections: present state, inputs, next state, and outputs. The             first two are obtained by listing all binary combinations. The output section is deter-             mined from the output equations. The next-state values are evaluated from the state             equations. For a D-type flip-flop, the state equation is the same as the input equation.             When a flip-flop other than the D type is used, such as JK or T, it is necessary to refer    Section 5.5 Analysis of Clocked Sequential Circuits 211                                                                                 Present    Next                                                                                 state Inputs state                                                                                         A xy A                                                                                         0  00 0 x                              D                                             A          0  01 1                                                                                         0  10 1 y                                                                                       0  11 0                                   Clk                                                   1  00 1                                                                                         1  01 0                                                                                         1  10 0                         Clock                                                           1  11 1    (a) Circuit diagram                                                                  (b) State table    00, 11                              01, 10                                   00, 11                      0                            1                                                     01, 10                                                           (c) State diagram    FIGURE 5.17    Sequential circuit with D flip-flop to the corresponding characteristic table or characteristic equation to obtain the next- state values. We will illustrate the procedure first by using the characteristic table and again by using the characteristic equation.    The next-state values of a sequential circuit that uses JK- or T-type flip-flops can be derived as follows:    1. Determine the flip-flop input equations in terms of the present state and input        variables.    2. List the binary values of each input equation.    3. Use the corresponding flip-flop characteristic table to determine the next-state        values in the state table.    As an example, consider the sequential circuit with two JK flip-flops A and B and one input x, as shown in Fig. 5.18. The circuit has no outputs; therefore, the state table does not need an output column. (The outputs of the flip-flops may be considered as the outputs in this case.) The circuit can be specified by the flip-flop input equations                              JA = B KA = Bx                               JB = x KB = Ax + Ax = A  x    The state table of the sequential circuit is shown in Table 5.4. The present-state and input columns list the eight binary combinations. The binary values listed under the                                                             J                                          A                                                                                         Clk x                                                                                      K                                                             J                                          B                                                                Clk                                                             K    Clock FIGURE 5.18 Sequential circuit with JK flip-flop columns labeled flip-flop inputs are not part of the state table, but they are needed for the purpose of evaluating the next state as specified in step 2 of the procedure. These binary values are obtained directly from the four input equations in a manner similar to that for obtaining a truth table from a Boolean expression. The next state of each flip-flop is evaluated from the corresponding J and K inputs and the characteristic table of the JK flip-flop listed in Table 5.1. There are four cases to consider.

When J = K = 1, the next-state bit is the complement of the present-state bit.             Examples of the last two cases occur in the table when the present state AB is 10 and             input x is 0. JA and KA are both equal to 0 and the present state of A is 1. Therefore, the             next state of A remains the same and is equal to 1. In the same row of the table, JB and             KB are both equal to 1. Since the present state of B is 0, the next state of B is comple-             mented and changes to 1.                 The next-state values can also be obtained by evaluating the state equations from the             characteristic equation. This is done by using the following procedure:                 1. Determine the flip-flop input equations in terms of the present state and input                     variables.                 2. Substitute the input equations into the flip-flop characteristic equation to obtain                     the state equations.                 3. Use the corresponding state equations to determine the next-state values in the                     state table.                 The input equations for the two JK flip-flops of Fig. 5.18 were listed a couple of para-             graphs ago. The characteristic equations for the flip-flops are obtained by substituting             A or B for the name of the flip-flop, instead of Q:                                                      A(t + 1) = JA + KA                                                      B(t + 1) = JB + KB             Substituting the values of JA and KA from the input equations, we obtain the state equa-             tion for A:                                    A(t + 1) = BA + (Bx) A = AB + AB + Ax             The state equation provides the bit values for the column headed Next State for A in             the state table. Similarly, the state equation for flip-flop B can be derived from the char-             acteristic equation by substituting the values of JB and KB:                                 B(t + 1) = xB + (A { x)B = Bx + ABx + ABx             The state equation provides the bit values for the column headed Next State for B in             the state table. Note that the columns in Table 5.4 headed Flip-Flop Inputs are not             needed when state equations are used.                 The state diagram of the sequential circuit is shown in Fig. 5.19. Note that since the             circuit has no outputs, the directed lines out of the circles are marked with one binary             number only, to designate the value of input x. Analysis with T Flip-Flops             The analysis of a sequential circuit with T flip-flops follows the same procedure outlined             for JK flip-flops. The next-state values in the state table can be obtained by using either 1                                          0       1                                               11 S3 S0 00 0                                          0  0 S1 01                                         10 S2                       1                            1 FIGURE 5.19 State diagram of the circuit of Fig. 5.18 the characteristic table listed in Table 5.1 or the characteristic equation                                  Q(t + 1) = T { Q = TQ + TQ Now consider the sequential circuit shown in Fig. 5.20. It has two flip-flops A and B, one input x, and one output y and can be described algebraically by two input equations and an output equation:                                                  TA = Bx                                                   TB = x                                                     y = AB The state table for the circuit is listed in Table 5.5. The values for y are obtained from the output equation. The values for the next state can be derived from the state equa- tions by substituting TA and TB in the characteristic equations, yielding                     A(t + 1) = (Bx)A + (Bx)A = AB + Ax + ABx                     B(t + 1) = x  B The next-state values for A and B in the state table are obtained from the expressions of the two state equations.    The state diagram of the circuit is shown in Fig. 5.20(b).As long as input x is equal to 1, the circuit behaves as a binary counter with a sequence of states 00, 01, 10, 11, and back to 00. When x = 0, the circuit remains in the same state. Output y is equal to 1 when the present state is 11. Here, the output depends on the present state only and is independent of the input. The two values inside each circle and separated by a slash are for the present state and output. Mealy and Moore Models of Finite State Machines             The most general model of a sequential circuit has inputs, outputs, and internal states. It             is customary to distinguish between two models of sequential circuits: the Mealy model             and the Moore model. Both are shown in Fig. 5.21.They differ only in the way the output    Section 5.5 Analysis of Clocked Sequential Circuits 215 x  T             A                                                                 y             Clk               R                                                              0                        0    T                                                      00/0     1                  01/0                       B             Clk                                           1                              1             R                                                           11/1 1                      10/0                                                                 0                           0              Clock reset                                           (b) State diagram               (a) Circuit diagram    FIGURE 5.20    Sequential circuit with T flip-flops (Binary Counter)    Table 5.5    State Table for Sequential Circuit with T Flip-Flops    Present       Input   Next                                      Output     State                State                                                                        y    A B           x       A B                                           0                                                                        0    0 0           0       0 0                                           0                                                                        0    0 0           1       0 1                                           0                                                                        0    0 1           0       0 1                                           1                                                                        1    0 1           1       1 0    1 0           0       1 0    1 0           1       1 1    1 1           0       1 1    1 1           1       0 0                                               Mealy Machine Inputs     Next State                  State                       Output   Outputs         Combinational                Register                Combinational  (Mealy-type)              Logic                                                  Logic                        Clock                                 (a)         Moore Machine Inputs     Next State                  State                      Output    Outputs         Combinational                Register                Combinational  (Moore-type)              Logic                                                Logic                                           Clock                                                    (b)         FIGURE 5.21         Block diagrams of Mealy and Moore state machines         is generated. In the Mealy model, the output is a function of both the present state and         the input. In the Moore model, the output is a function of only the present state. A circuit         may have both types of outputs. The two models of a sequential circuit are commonly         referred to as a finite state machine, abbreviated FSM. The Mealy model of a sequential         circuit is referred to as a Mealy FSM or Mealy machine. The Moore model is referred         to as a Moore FSM or Moore machine.            The circuit presented previously in Fig. 5.15 is an example of a Mealy machine. Out-         put y is a function of both input x and the present state of A and B. The corresponding         state diagram in Fig. 5.16 shows both the input and output values, separated by a slash         along the directed lines between the states.            An example of a Moore model is given in Fig. 5.18. Here, the output is a function of         the present state only. The corresponding state diagram in Fig. 5.19 has only inputs marked         along the directed lines. The outputs are the flip-flop states marked inside the circles.         Another example of a Moore model is the sequential circuit of Fig. 5.20. The output         depends only on flip-flop values, and that makes it a function of the present state only.         The input value in the state diagram is labeled along the directed line, but the output         value is indicated inside the circle together with the present state.            In a Moore model, the outputs of the sequential circuit are synchronized with the         clock, because they depend only on flip-flop outputs that are synchronized with the         clock. In a Mealy model, the outputs may change if the inputs change during the clock                   Section 5.6 Synthesizable HDL Models of Sequential Circuits 217      cycle. Moreover, the outputs may have momentary false values because of the delay      encountered from the time that the inputs change and the time that the flip-flop outputs      change. In order to synchronize a Mealy-type circuit, the inputs of the sequential circuit      must be synchronized with the clock and the outputs must be sampled immediately      before the clock edge. The inputs are changed at the inactive edge of the clock to ensure      that the inputs to the flip-flops stabilize before the active edge of the clock occurs. Thus,      the output of the Mealy machine is the value that is present immediately before the      active edge of the clock. 5.6  SYNTHESIZABLE HDL MODELS      OF SEQUENTIAL CIRCUITS       The Verilog HDL was introduced in Section 3.9. Combinational circuits were described       in Section 4.12, and behavioral modeling with Verilog was introduced in that section       as well. Behavioral models are abstract representations of the functionality of digi-       tal hardware. That is, they describe how a circuit behaves, but dont specify the internal       details of the circuit. Historically, the abstraction has been described by truth tables,       state tables, and state diagrams. An HDL describes the functionality differently,       by language constructs that represent the operations of registers in a machine.       This representation has added value, i.e., it is important for you to know how to use,       because it can be simulated to produce waveforms demonstrating the behavior of the       machine. Behavioral Modeling             There are two kinds of abstract behaviors in the Verilog HDL. Behavior declared by             the keyword initial is called single-pass behavior and specifies a single statement or             a block statement (i.e., a list of statements enclosed by either a begin . . . end or a             fork . . . join keyword pair). A single-pass behavior expires after the associated state-             ment executes. In practice, designers use single-pass behavior primarily to prescribe             stimulus signals in a test benchnever to model the behavior of a circuitbecause             synthesis tools do not accept descriptions that use the initial statement. The always             keyword declares a cyclic behavior. Both types of behaviors begin executing when             the simulator launches at time t = 0. The initial behavior expires after its statement             executes; the always behavior executes and reexecutes indefinitely, until the simula-             tion is stopped. A module may contain an arbitrary number of initial or always behav-             ioral statements. They execute concurrently with respect to each other, starting at             time 0, and may interact through common variables. Heres a word description of how             an always statement works for a simple model of a D flip-flop: Whenever the rising             edge of the clock occurs, if the reset input is asserted, the output q gets 0; otherwise             the output Q gets the value of the input D. The execution of statements triggered by             the clock is repeated until the simulation ends. Well see shortly how to write this             description in Verilog.    An initial behavioral statement executes only once. It begins its execution at the start of simulation and expires after all of its statements have completed execution. As men- tioned at the end of Section 4.12, the initial statement is useful for generating input signals to simulate a design. In simulating a sequential circuit, it is necessary to generate a clock source for triggering the flip-flops. The following are two possible ways to pro- vide a free-running clock that operates for a specified number of cycles: initial                  initial  begin                    begin    clock = 1\\'b0;            clock = 1\\'b0;    repeat (30)            end     #10 clock = ~clock;  end                     initial 300 $finish;                          always #10 clock = ~clock; In the first version, the initial block contains two statements enclosed within the begin and end keywords.The first statement sets clock to 0 at time = 0. The second statement specifies a loop that reexecutes 30 times to wait 10 time units and then complement the value of clock. This produces 15 clock cycles, each with a cycle time of 20 time units. In the second version, the first initial behavior has a single statement that sets clock to 0 at time = 0, and it then expires (causes no further simulation activity). The second single- pass behavior declares a stopwatch for the simulation. The system task finish causes the simulation to terminate unconditionally after 300 time units have elapsed. Because this behavior has only one statement associated with it, there is no need to write the begin . . . end keyword pair.After 10 time units, the always statement repeatedly complements clock, providing a clock generator having a cycle time of 20 time units. The three behavioral statements in the second example can be written in any order.    Here is another way to describe a free-running clock: initial begin clock = 0; forever #10 clock = ~clock; end This version, with two statements in one block statement, initializes the clock and then executes an indefinite loop (forever) in which the clock is complemented after a delay of 10 time steps. Note that the single-pass behavior never finishes executing and so does not expire. Another behavior would have to terminate the simulation.    The activity associated with either type of behavioral statement can be controlled by a delay operator that waits for a certain time or by an event control operator that waits for certain conditions to become true or for specified events (changes in signals) to occur. Time delays specified with the # delay control operator are commonly used in single-pass behaviors. The delay control operator suspends execution of statements until a specified time has elapsed. Weve already seen examples of its use to specify signals in a test bench. Another operator @ is called the event control operator and is used to suspend activity until an event occurs. An event can be an unconditional change in a signal value (e.g., @ A) or a specified transition of a signal value (e.g., @ (posedge clock)). The general form of this type of statement is always @ (event control expression) begin       // Procedural assignment statements that execute when the condition is met end Section 5.6 Synthesizable HDL Models of Sequential Circuits 219 The event control expression specifies the condition that must occur to launch execu- tion of the procedural assignment statements. The variables in the left-hand side of the procedural statements must be of the reg data type and must be declared as such. The right-hand side can be any expression that produces a value using Verilog-defined operators.    The event control expression (also called the sensitivity list) specifies the events that must occur to initiate execution of the procedural statements associated with the always block. Statements within the block execute sequentially from top to bottom. After the last statement executes, the behavior waits for the event control expression to be satisfied. Then the statements are executed again. The sensitivity list can specify level- sensitive events, edge-sensitive events, or a combination of the two. In practice, design- ers do not make use of the third option, because this third form is not one that synthesis tools are able to translate into physical hardware. Level-sensitive events occur in com- binational circuits and in latches. For example, the statement always @ (A or B or C) will initiate execution of the procedural statements in the associated always block if a change occurs in A, B, or C. In synchronous sequential circuits, changes in flip-flops occur only in response to a transition of a clock pulse. The transition may be either a positive edge or a negative edge of the clock, but not both. Verilog HDL takes care of these conditions by providing two keywords: posedge and negedge. For example, the expression always @(posedge clock or negedge reset)  // Verilog 1995 will initiate execution of the associated procedural statements only if the clock goes through a positive transition or if reset goes through a negative transition. The 2001 and 2005 revisions to the Verilog language allow a comma-separated list for the event con- trol expression (or sensitivity list): always @(posedge clock, negedge reset)    // Verilog 2001, 2005    A procedural assignment is an assignment of a logic value to a variable within an initial or always statement. This is in contrast to a continuous assignment discussed in Section 4.12 with dataflow modeling. A continuous assignment has an implicit level- sensitive sensitivity list consisting of all of the variables on the right-hand side of its assignment statement. The updating of a continuous assignment is triggered whenever an event occurs in a variable included on the right-hand side of its expression. In con- trast, a procedural assignment is made only when an assignment statement is executed and assigns value to it within a behavioral statement. For example, the clock signal in the preceding example was complemented only when the statement clock = ~clock executed; the statement did not execute until 10 time units after the simulation began. It is important to remember that a variable having type reg remains unchanged until a procedural assignment is made to give it a new value.    There are two kinds of procedural assignments: blocking and nonblocking. The two are distinguished by the symbols that they use. Blocking assignments use the symbol (=) as the assignment operator, and nonblocking assignments use (< =) as the operator.             Blocking assignment statements are executed sequentially in the order they are listed             in a block of statements. Nonblocking assignments are executed concurrently by evalu-             ating the set of expressions on the right-hand side of the list of statements; they do not             make assignments to their left-hand sides until all of the expressions are evaluated. The             two types of assignments may be better understood by means of an illustration. Consider             these two procedural blocking assignments:                                                                       B = A                                                                       C = B + 1             The first statement transfers the value of A into B.The second statement increments the             value of B and transfers the new value to C. At the completion of the assignments, C             contains the value of A + 1.                 Now consider the two statements as nonblocking assignments:                                                                      B <= A                                                                      C <= B + 1             When the statements are executed, the expressions on the right-hand side are evaluated             and stored in a temporary location. The value of A is kept in one storage location and             the value of B + 1 in another. After all the expressions in the block are evaluated and             stored, the assignment to the targets on the left-hand side is made. In this case, C will             contain the original value of B, plus 1. A general rule is to use blocking assignments when             sequential ordering is imperative and in cyclic behavior that is level sensitive (i.e., in             combinational logic). Use nonblocking assignments when modeling concurrent execu-             tion (e.g., edge-sensitive behavior such as synchronous, concurrent register transfers)             and when modeling latched behavior. Nonblocking assignments are imperative in deal-             ing with register transfer level design, as shown in Chapter 8.They model the concurrent             operations of physical hardware synchronized by a common clock. Todays designers             are expected to know what features of an HDL are useful in a practical way and how to             avoid features that are not. Following these rules for using the assignment operators will             prevent conditions that lead synthesis tools astray and create mismatches between             the behavior of a model and the behavior of physical hardware that is produced by a             synthesis tool. HDL Models of Flip-Flops and Latches             HDL Examples 5.1 through 5.4 show Verilog descriptions of various flip-flops and a D             latch. The D latch is said to be transparent because it responds to a change in data input             with a change in the output as long as the enable input is assertedviewing the output             is the same as viewing the input. The description of a D latch is shown in HDL Example             5.1 It has two inputs, D and enable, and one output, Q. Since Q is assigned value in a             behavior, its type must be declared to be reg. Hardware latches respond to input signal             levels, so the two inputs are listed without edge qualifiers in the sensitivity list following             the @ symbol in the always statement. In this model, there is only one blocking proce-             dural assignment statement, and it specifies the transfer of input D to output Q if enable              Section 5.6 Synthesizable HDL Models of Sequential Circuits 221 is true (logic 1).1 Note that this statement is executed every time there is a change in D if enable is 1.    A D-type flip-flop is the simplest example of a sequential machine. HDL Example 5.2 describes two positive-edge D flip-flops in two modules. The first responds only to the clock; the second includes an asynchronous reset input. Output Q must be declared as a reg data type in addition to being listed as an output. This is because it is a target output of a procedural assignment statement. The keyword posedge ensures that the transfer of input D into Q is synchronized by the positive-edge transition of Clk. A change in D at any other time does not change Q. HDL Example 5.1 (D-Latch) // Description of D latch (See Fig. 5.6) module D_latch (Q, D, enable); output Q; input D, enable; reg Q; always @ (enable or D) if (enable) Q <= D;             // Same as: if (enable == 1) endmodule // Alternative syntax (Verilog 2001, 2005) module D_latch (output reg Q, input enable, D); always @ (enable, D) if (enable) Q <= D;             // No action if enable not asserted endmodule HDL Example 5.2 (D-Type Flip-Flop) // D ip-op without reset module D_FF (Q, D, Clk);  output Q;  input D, Clk;  reg Q;  always @ (posedge Clk)     Q <= D;  endmodule // D ip-op with asynchronous reset (V2001, V2005) module DFF (output reg Q, input D, Clk, rst); always @ (posedge Clk, negedge rst) if (!rst) Q <= 1\\'b0;      // Same as: if (rst == 0) else Q <= D; endmodule 1The statement (single or block) associated with if (Boolean expression) executes if the Boolean expression is true.    The second module includes an asynchronous reset input in addition to the synchro- nous clock. A specific form of an if statement is used to describe such a flip-flop so that the model can be synthesized by a software tool. The event expression after the @ sym- bol in the always statement may have any number of edge events, either posedge or negedge. For modeling hardware, one of the events must be a clock event. The remain- ing events specify conditions under which asynchronous logic is to be executed. The designer knows which signal is the clock, but clock is not an identifier that software tools automatically recognize as the synchronizing signal of a circuit. The tool must be able to infer which signal is the clock, so you need to write the description in a way that enables the tool to infer the clock correctly. The rules are simple to follow: (1) Each if or else if statement in the procedural assignment statements is to correspond to an asynchronous event, (2) the last else statement corresponds to the clock event, and (3) the asynchro- nous events are tested first. There are two edge events in the second module of HDL Example 5.2. The negedge rst (reset) event is asynchronous, since it matches the if (!rst) statement. As long as rst is 0, Q is cleared to 0. If Clk has a positive transition, its effect is blocked. Only if rst = 1 can the posedge clock event synchronously transfer D into Q.    Hardware always has a reset signal. It is strongly recommended that all models of edge-sensitive behavior include a reset (or preset) input signal; otherwise, the initial state of the flip-flops of the sequential circuit cannot be determined. A sequential circuit cannot be tested with HDL simulation unless an initial state can be assigned with an input signal.    HDL Example 5.3 describes the construction of a T or JK flip-flop from a D flip-flop and gates. The circuit is described with the characteristic equations of the flip-flops: Q(t + 1) = Q { T                            for a T flip-flop Q(t + 1) = JQ + KQ                          for a JK flip-flop The first module, TFF, describes a T flip-flop by instantiating DFF. (Instantiation is explained in Section 4.12.) The declared wire, DT, is assigned the exclusive-OR of Q and T, as is required for building a T flip-flop with a D flip-flop. The instantiation with the value of DT replacing D in module DFF produces the required T flip-flop. The JK flip-flop is specified in a similar manner by using its characteristic equation to define a replacement for D in the instantiated DFF.

Here, we describe             the flip-flop by using the characteristic table rather than the characteristic equation. The             case multiway branch condition checks the two-bit number obtained by concatenating             the bits of J and K. The case expression ({J, K}) is evaluated and compared with the             values in the list of statements that follows. The first value that matches the true condi-             tion is executed. Since the concatenation of J and K produces a two-bit number, it can             be equal to 00, 01, 10, or 11. The first bit gives the value of J and the second the value of             K.The four possible conditions specify the value of the next state of Q after the applica-             tion of a positive-edge clock.

A Mealy HDL model is presented in HDL Example 5.5 for the             zero-detector machine described by the sequential circuit in Fig. 5.15 and its state diagram             shown in Fig. 5.16. The input, output, clock, and reset are declared in the usual manner.             The state of the flip-flops is declared with identifiers state and next_state. These variables             hold the values of the present state and the next value of the sequential circuit. The states             binary assignment is done with a parameter statement. (Verilog allows constants to be             defined in a module by the keyword parameter.) The four states S0 through S3 are assigned             binary 00 through 11.The notation S2 = 2b10 is preferable to the alternative S2 = 2. The             former uses only two bits to store the constant, whereas the latter results in a binary num-             ber with 32 (or 64) bits because an unsized number is interpreted and sized as an integer.

Its Verilog model uses three always blocks that execute concurrently and inter- act through common variables. The first always statement resets the circuit to the initial state S0 = 00 and specifies the synchronous clocked operation. The statement state <= next_state is synchronized to a positive-edge transition of the clock. This means that any change in the value of next_state in the second always block can affect the value of state only as a result of a posedge event of clock. The second always block determines the value of the next state transition as a function of the present state and input. The value assigned to state by the nonblocking assignment is the value of next_state immediately before the rising edge of clock. Notice how the multiway branch condition implements the state transitions specified by the annotated edges in the state diagram of Fig. 5.16. The third always block specifies the output as a function of the present state and the input. Although this block is listed as a separate behavior for clarity, it could be com- bined with the second block. Note that the value of output y_out may change if the value of input x_in changes while the circuit is in any given state.    So lets summarize how the model describes the behavior of the machine: At every ris- ing edge of clock, if reset is not asserted, the state of the machine is updated by the first always block; when state is updated by the first always block, the change in state is detected by the sensitivity list mechanism of the second always block; then the second always block updates the value of next_state (it will be used by the first always block at the next tick of the clock); the third always block also detects the change in state and updates the value of the output. In addition, the second and third always blocks detect changes in x_in and update next_state and y_out accordingly. The test bench provided with Mealy_Zero_ Detector provides some waveforms to stimulate the model, producing the results shown in Fig. 5.22. Notice how t_y_out responds to changes in both the state and the input, and has a glitch (a transient logic value). We display both to state[1:0] and next_state[1:0] to illus- trate how changes in t_x_in influence the value of next_state and t_y_out. The Mealy glitch in t_y_out is due to the (intentional) dynamic behavior of t_x_in. The input, t_x_in, settles                  Stream of 1s                  0                30                            60            90 t_clock t_reset t_x_in state[1:0]          0          1  3   0  1                             0      01       0 next_state[1:0]     0 1 3 2 0 13                                    0         1 13  0 t_y_out                                             valid Mealy output  Mealy glitch          FIGURE 5.22          Simulation output of Mealy_Zero_Detector to a value of 0 immediately before the clock, and at the clock, the state makes a transition from 0 to 1, which is consistent with Fig. 5.16.The output is 1 in state S1 immediately before the clock, and changes to 0 as the state enters S0.    The description of waveforms in the test bench uses the fork . . . join construct. State- ments with the fork . . . join block execute in parallel, so the time delays are relative to a common reference of t = 0, the time at which the block begins execution.2 It is usually more convenient to use the fork . . . join block instead of the begin . . . end block in describing waveforms. Notice that the waveform of reset is triggered on the fly to demonstrate that the machine recovers from an unexpected (asynchronous) reset con- dition during any state.    How does our Verilog model Mealy_Zero_Detector correspond to hardware? The first always block corresponds to a D flip-flop implementation of the state register in Fig. 5.21; the second always block is the combinational logic block describing the next state; the third always block describes the output combinational logic of the zero-detecting Mealy machine. The register operation of the state transition uses the nonblocking assignment operator (< =) because the (edge-sensitive) flip-flops of a sequential machine are updated concurrently by a common clock. The second and third always blocks describe combina- tional logic, which is level sensitive, so they use the blocking (=) assignment operator. 2A fork . . . join block completes execution when the last executing statement within it completes its execution.              Section 5.6 Synthesizable HDL Models of Sequential Circuits 227 Their sensitivity lists include both the state and the input because their logic must respond to a change in either or both of them.    Note: The modeling style illustrated by Mealy_Zero_Detector is commonly used by designers because it has a close relationship to the state diagram of the machine that is being described. Notice that the reset signal is associated with the always block that synchronizes the state transitions. In this example, it is modeled as an active-low reset. Because the reset condition is included in the description of the state transitions, there is no need to include it in the combinational logic that specifies the next state and the output, and the resulting description is less verbose, simpler, and more readable.    HDL Example 5.6 presents the Verilog behavioral model of the Moore FSM shown in Fig. 5.18 and having the state diagram given in Fig. 5.19. The model illustrates an alternative style in which the state transitions of the machine are described by a single clocked (i.e., edge-sensitive) cyclic behavior, i.e., by one always block. The present state of the circuit is identified by the variable state, and its transitions are triggered by the rising edge of the clock according to the conditions listed in the case statement. The combinational logic that determines the next state is included in the nonblocking assign- ment to state. In this example, the output of the circuits is independent of the input and is taken directly from the outputs of the flip-flops. The two-bit output y_out is specified with a continuous assignment statement and is equal to the value of the present state vector. Figure 5.23 shows some simulation results for Moore_Model_Fig_5_19. Here are some important observations: (1) the output depends on only the state, (2) reset on-the-fly forces the state of the machine back to S0 (00), and (3) the state transitions are consistent with Fig. 5.19.

Sequential circuits are composed of com-             binational logic and flip-flops, and their HDL models use sequential UDPs and             behavioral statements (edge-sensitive cyclic behaviors) to describe the operation of             flip-flops. One way to describe a sequential circuit uses a combination of dataflow             and behavioral statements. The flip-flops are described with an always statement. The             combinational part can be described with assign statements and Boolean equations.             The separate modules can be combined to form a structural model by instantiation             within a module.                 The structural description of a Moore-type zero detector sequential circuit is shown             in HDL Example 5.7. We want to encourage the reader to consider alternative ways to             model a circuit, so as a point of comparison, we first present Moore_Model_Fig_5_20,             a Verilog behavioral description of a binary counter having the state diagram examined             earlier shown in Fig. 5.20(b). This style of modeling follows directly from the state dia-             gram. An alternative style, used in Moore_Model_STR_Fig_5_20, represents the struc-             ture shown in Fig. 5.20(a). This style uses two modules. The first describes the circuit of             Fig. 5.20(a). The second describes the T flip-flop that will be used by the circuit. We also             show two ways to model the T flip-flop. The first asserts that, at every clock tick, the             value of the output of the flip-flop toggles if the toggle input is asserted. The second             model describes the behavior of the toggle flip-flop in terms of its characteristic equa-             tion. The first style is attractive because it does not require the reader to remember the             characteristic equation. Nonetheless, the models are interchangeable and will synthesize             to the same hardware circuit. A test bench module provides a stimulus for verifying the             functionality of the circuit. The sequential circuit is a two-bit binary counter controlled             by input x_in. The output, y_out, is enabled when the count reaches binary 11. Flip-flops              Section 5.6 Synthesizable HDL Models of Sequential Circuits 229 A and B are included as outputs in order to check their operation. The flip-flop input equations and the output equation are evaluated with continuous assignment (assign) statements having the corresponding Boolean expressions. The instantiated T flip-flops use TA and TB as defined by the input equations.    The second module describes the T flip-flop. The reset input resets the flip-flop to 0 with an active-low signal. The operation of the flip-flop is specified by its characteristic equation, Q(t + 1) = Q { T.    The test bench includes both models of the machine. The stimulus module provides common inputs to the circuits to simultaneously display their output responses. The first initial block provides eight clock cycles with a period of 10 ns. The second initial block specifies a toggling of input x_in that occurs at the negative edge transition of the clock. The result of the simulation is shown in Fig. 5.24. The pair (A, B) goes through the binary sequence 00, 01, 10, 11, and back to 00. The change in the count is triggered by a positive edge of the clock, provided that x_in = 1. If x_in = 0, the count does not change. y_out is equal to 1 when both A and B are equal to 1. This verifies the main functionality of the circuit, but not a recovery from an unexpected reset event.

The design (synthesis) of a sequential circuit starts from a set of       specifications and culminates in a logic diagram. Design procedures are presented in       Section 5.8. Two sequential circuits may exhibit the same inputCoutput behavior, but       have a different number of internal states in their state diagram. The current section       discusses certain properties of sequential circuits that may simplify a design by reduc-       ing the number of gates and flip-flops it uses. In general, reducing the number of flip-       flops reduces the cost of a circuit. State Reduction             The reduction in the number of flip-flops in a sequential circuit is referred to as the             state-reduction problem. State-reduction algorithms are concerned with procedures for             reducing the number of states in a state table, while keeping the external inputCoutput             requirements unchanged. Since m flip-flops produce 2m states, a reduction in the number             of states may (or may not) result in a reduction in the number of flip-flops. An unpre-             dictable effect in reducing the number of flip-flops is that sometimes the equivalent             circuit (with fewer flip-flops) may require more combinational gates to realize its next             state and output logic.                 We will illustrate the state-reduction procedure with an example. We start with a sequen-             tial circuit whose specification is given in the state diagram of Fig. 5.25. In our example, only             the inputCoutput sequences are important; the internal states are used merely to provide             the required sequences. For that reason, the states marked inside the circles are denoted                          0/0                                       0/0                                a                                        0/0                                  1/0                     0/0     b                                         0/0     c                                1/0                                    1/0 0/0                  g          d                                                    e                  0/0 1/1 1/1                                       f 1/1                                                                  1/1 FIGURE 5.25 State diagram by letter symbols instead of their binary values. This is in contrast to a binary counter, wherein the binary value sequence of the states themselves is taken as the outputs.    There are an infinite number of input sequences that may be applied to the circuit; each results in a unique output sequence. As an example, consider the input sequence 01010110100 starting from the initial state a. Each input of 0 or 1 produces an output of 0 or 1 and causes the circuit to go to the next state. From the state diagram, we obtain the output and state sequence for the given input sequence as follows: With the circuit in initial state a, an input of 0 produces an output of 0 and the circuit remains in state a. With present state a and an input of 1, the output is 0 and the next state is b. With pres- ent state b and an input of 0, the output is 0 and the next state is c. Continuing this process, we find the complete sequence to be as follows: state   a  a  b     c    d     e                                           f        f  g  f  g  a input   0  1  0     1    0     1                                           1        0  1  0  0 output  0  0  0     0    0     1                                           1        0  1  0  0 In each column, we have the present state, input value, and output value. The next state is written on top of the next column. It is important to realize that in this circuit the states themselves are of secondary importance, because we are interested only in output sequences caused by input sequences.    Now let us assume that we have found a sequential circuit whose state diagram has fewer than seven states, and suppose we wish to compare this circuit with the circuit whose state diagram is given by Fig. 5.25. If identical input sequences are applied to the two circuits and identical outputs occur for all input sequences, then the two circuits are said to be equivalent (as far as the inputCoutput is concerned) and one may be replaced by the other. The problem of state reduction is to find ways of reducing the number of states in a sequential circuit without altering the inputCoutput relationships.                  Section 5.7 State Reduction and Assignment 233    We now proceed to reduce the number of states for this example. First, we need the state table; it is more convenient to apply procedures for state reduction with the use of a table rather than a diagram. The state table of the circuit is listed in Table 5.6 and is obtained directly from the state diagram.    The following algorithm for the state reduction of a completely specified state table is given here without proof: Two states are said to be equivalent if, for each member of the set of inputs, they give exactly the same output and send the circuit either to the same state or to an equivalent state. When two states are equivalent, one of them can be removed without altering the inputCoutput relationships.    Now apply this algorithm to Table 5.6. Going through the state table, we look for two present states that go to the same next state and have the same output for both input combinations. States e and g are two such states: They both go to states a and f and have outputs of 0 and 1 for x = 0 and x = 1, respectively. Therefore, states g and e are equiv- alent, and one of these states can be removed. The procedure of removing a state and replacing it by its equivalent is demonstrated in Table 5.7. The row with present state g is removed, and state g is replaced by state e each time it occurs in the columns headed Next State.    Present state f now has next states e and f and outputs 0 and 1 for x = 0 and x = 1, respectively. The same next states and outputs appear in the row with present state d. Therefore, states f and d are equivalent, and state f can be removed and replaced by d. The final reduced table is shown in Table 5.8. The state diagram for the reduced table consists of only five states and is shown in Fig. 5.26. This state diagram satisfies the original inputCoutput specifications and will produce the required output sequence for any given input sequence. The following list derived from the state diagram of Fig. 5.26 is for the input sequence used previously (note that the same output sequence results, although the state sequence is different): state   a  a  b           c  d  e        d  d  e       d  e  a input   0  1  0           1  0  1        1  0  1       0  0 output  0  0  0           0  0  1        1  0  1       0  0            Table 5.6         Next State        Output            State Table                              x0 x1          x0 x1            Present State                    a         a     b        0     0                    b                    c         c     d        0     0                    d                    e         a     d        0     0                    f                    g         e     f        0     1                              a     f        0     1                              g     f        0     1                              a     f        0     1 Table 5.7 Reducing the State Table                             Next State                   Output Present State               x0 x1                        x0 x1 a                           a               b            0       0 b                           c               d            0       0 c                           a               d            0       0 d                           e               f            0       1 e                           a               f            0       1 f                           e               f            0       1 Table 5.8                   Next State                   Output Reduced State Table                             x0 x1                        x0 x1 Present State         a                   a               b            0       0         b         c                   c               d            0       0         d         e                   a               d            0       0                             e               d            0       1                             a               d            0       1 In fact, this sequence is exactly the same as that obtained for Fig. 5.25 if we replace g by e and f by d.    Checking each pair of states for equivalency can be done systematically by means of a procedure that employs an implication table, which consists of squares, one for every suspected pair of possible equivalent states. By judicious use of the table, it is possible to determine all pairs of equivalent states in a state table.                             0/0                             0/0 a 0/0                                         1/0                        e                         0/0  c                                  b                        0/0  1/1 1/0                                  d 1/0                                             1/1 FIGURE 5.26 Reduced state diagram                                                  Section 5.7 State Reduction and Assignment 235                 The sequential circuit of this example was reduced from seven to five states. In             general, reducing the number of states in a state table may result in a circuit with             less equipment. However, the fact that a state table has been reduced to fewer states             does not guarantee a saving in the number of flip-flops or the number of gates. In             actual practice designers may skip this step because target devices are rich in             resources. State Assignment             In order to design a sequential circuit with physical components, it is necessary to assign             unique coded binary values to the states. For a circuit with m states, the codes must con-             tain n bits, where 2n  m. For example, with three bits, it is possible to assign codes to             eight states, denoted by binary numbers 000 through 111. If the state table of Table 5.6 is             used, we must assign binary values to seven states; the remaining state is unused. If the             state table of Table 5.8 is used, only five states need binary assignment, and we are left             with three unused states. Unused states are treated as dont-care conditions during the             design. Since dont-care conditions usually help in obtaining a simpler circuit, it is more             likely but not certain that the circuit with five states will require fewer combinational             gates than the one with seven states.                 The simplest way to code five states is to use the first five integers in binary counting             order, as shown in the first assignment of Table 5.9. Another similar assignment is the             Gray code shown in assignment 2. Here, only one bit in the code group changes when             going from one number to the next. This code makes it easier for the Boolean functions             to be placed in the map for simplification. Another possible assignment often used in             the design of state machines to control data-path units is the one-hot assignment. This             configuration uses as many bits as there are states in the circuit. At any given time, only             one bit is equal to 1 while all others are kept at 0. This type of assignment uses one flip-             flop per state, which is not an issue for register-rich field-programmable gate arrays. (See             Chapter 7.) One-hot encoding usually leads to simpler decoding logic for the next state             and output. One-hot machines can be faster than machines with sequential binary             encoding, and the silicon area required by the extra flip-flops can be offset by the area Table 5.9 Three Possible Binary State Assignments        Assignment 1, Assignment 2, Assignment 3, State  Binary  Gray Code                 One-Hot a      000     000                       00001 b      001     001                       00010 c      010     011                       00100 d      011     010                       01000 e      100     110                       10000      Table 5.10      Reduced State Table with Binary Assignment 1      Present State    Next State                Output                     x0 x1                   x0 x1      000            000 001                        0  0      001            010 011                        0  0      010            000 011                        0  0      011            100 011                        0  1      100            000 011                        0  1      saved by using simpler decoding logic. This trade-off is not guaranteed, so it must be      evaluated for a given design.         Table 5.10 is the reduced state table with binary assignment 1 substituted for the let-      ter symbols of the states. A different assignment will result in a state table with different      binary values for the states. The binary form of the state table is used to derive the next-      state and output-forming combinational logic part of the sequential circuit. The com-      plexity of the combinational circuit depends on the binary state assignment chosen.         Sometimes, the name transition table is used for a state table with a binary assignment.      This convention distinguishes it from a state table with symbolic names for the states.      In this book, we use the same name for both types of state tables. 5.8  DESIGN PROCEDURE       Design procedures or methodologies specify hardware that will implement a desired       behavior. The design effort for small circuits may be manual, but industry relies on       automated synthesis tools for designing massive integrated circuits. The sequential build-       ing block used by synthesis tools is the D flip-flop. Together with additional logic, it can       implement the behavior of JK and T flip-flops. In fact, designers generally do not con-       cern themselves with the type of flip-flop; rather, their focus is on correctly describing       the sequential functionality that is to be implemented by the synthesis tool. Here we       will illustrate manual methods using D, JK, and T flip-flops.          The design of a clocked sequential circuit starts from a set of specifications and cul-       minates in a logic diagram or a list of Boolean functions from which the logic diagram       can be obtained. In contrast to a combinational circuit, which is fully specified by a truth       table, a sequential circuit requires a state table for its specification. The first step in the       design of sequential circuits is to obtain a state table or an equivalent representation,       such as a state diagram.3          A synchronous sequential circuit is made up of flip-flops and combinational gates. The       design of the circuit consists of choosing the flip-flops and then finding a combinational      3We will examine later another important representation of a machines behaviorthe algorithmic state      machine (ASM) chart.                                                          Section 5.8 Design Procedure 237 gate structure that, together with the flip-flops, produces a circuit which fulfills the stated specifications. The number of flip-flops is determined from the number of states needed in the circuit and the choice of state assignment codes. The combinational circuit is derived from the state table by evaluating the flip-flop input equations and output equa- tions. In fact, once the type and number of flip-flops are determined, the design process involves a transformation from a sequential circuit problem into a combinational circuit problem. In this way, the techniques of combinational circuit design can be applied.    The procedure for designing synchronous sequential circuits can be summarized by a list of recommended steps:    1. From the word description and specifications of the desired operation, derive a        state diagram for the circuit.    2. Reduce the number of states if necessary.    3. Assign binary values to the states.    4. Obtain the binary-coded state table.    5. Choose the type of flip-flops to be used.    6. Derive the simplified flip-flop input equations and output equations.    7. Draw the logic diagram.    The word specification of the circuit behavior usually assumes that the reader is famil- iar with digital logic terminology. It is necessary that the designer use intuition and expe- rience to arrive at the correct interpretation of the circuit specifications, because word descriptions may be incomplete and inexact. Once such a specification has been set down and the state diagram obtained, it is possible to use known synthesis procedures to com- plete the design. Although there are formal procedures for state reduction and assign- ment (steps 2 and 3), they are seldom used by experienced designers. Steps 4 through 7 in the design can be implemented by exact algorithms and therefore can be automated. The part of the design that follows a well-defined procedure is referred to as synthesis. Designers using logic synthesis tools (software) can follow a simplified process that devel- ops an HDL description directly from a state diagram, letting the synthesis tool deter- mine the circuit elements and structure that implement the description.    The first step is a critical part of the process, because succeeding steps depend on it. We will give one simple example to demonstrate how a state diagram is obtained from a word specification.    Suppose we wish to design a circuit that detects a sequence of three or more con- secutive 1s in a string of bits coming through an input line (i.e., the input is a serial bit stream). The state diagram for this type of circuit is shown in Fig. 5.27. It is derived by starting with state S0, the reset state. If the input is 0, the circuit stays in S0, but if the input is 1, it goes to state S1 to indicate that a 1 was detected. If the next input is 1, the change is to state S2 to indicate the arrival of two consecutive 1s, but if the input is 0, the state goes back to S0. The third consecutive 1 sends the circuit to state S3. If more 1s are detected, the circuit stays in S3. Any 0 input sends the circuit back to S0. In this way, the circuit stays in S3 as long as there are three or more consecutive 1s received. This is a Moore model sequential circuit, since the output is 1 when the circuit is in state S3 and is 0 otherwise.             0                   0          S0/0     1                         S1/0          0        0                                1                                                  S3/1 1 S2/0                                               1 FIGURE 5.27 State diagram for sequence detector Synthesis Using D Flip-Flops             Once the state diagram has been derived, the rest of the design follows a straight-             forward synthesis procedure. In fact, we can design the circuit by using an HDL             description of the state diagram and the proper HDL synthesis tools to obtain a             synthesized netlist. (The HDL description of the state diagram will be similar to             HDL Example 5.6 in Section 5.6.) To design the circuit by hand, we need to assign             binary codes to the states and list the state table. This is done in Table 5.11. The table             is derived from the state diagram of Fig. 5.27 with a sequential binary assignment.             We choose two D flip-flops to represent the four states, and we label their outputs             A and B. There is one input x and one output y. The characteristic equation of the             D flip-flop is Q(t + 1) = DQ, which means that the next-state values in the state             table specify the D input condition for the flip-flop.

The minterms for output y are obtained from the output                  column in the state table.                     The Boolean equations are simplified by means of the maps plotted in Fig. 5.28. The                  simplified equations are                                                                DA = Ax + Bx                                                                DB = Ax + Bx                                                                  y = AB                  The advantage of designing with D flip-flops is that the Boolean equations describing                  the inputs to the flip-flops can be obtained directly from the state table. Software tools                  automatically infer and select the D-type flip-flop from a properly written HDL model.                  The schematic of the sequential circuit is drawn in Fig. 5.29. Excitation Tables             The design of a sequential circuit with flip-flops other than the D type is complicated             by the fact that the input equations for the circuit must be derived indirectly from the             state table. When D-type flip-flops are employed, the input equations are obtained             directly from the next state. This is not the case for the JK and T types of flip-flops. In             order to determine the input equations for these flip-flops, it is necessary to derive a             functional relationship between the state table and the input equations.                 The flip-flop characteristic tables presented in Table 5.1 provide the value of the             next state when the inputs and the present state are known. These tables are useful       x                                     Clk                                             D    B                                                             Clk                                                                                          B                                             Clock                                                                                                                                    y     FIGURE 5.29     Logic diagram of a Moore-type sequence detector for analyzing sequential circuits and for defining the operation of the flip-flops. Dur- ing the design process, we usually know the transition from the present state to the next state and wish to find the flip-flop input conditions that will cause the required transition. For this reason, we need a table that lists the required inputs for a given change of state. Such a table is called an excitation table.    Table 5.12 shows the excitation tables for the two flip-flops (JK and T). Each table has a column for the present state Q(t), a column for the next state Q(t + 1), and a column for each input to show how the required transition is achieved. There are four possible transitions from the present state to the next state. The required input condi- tions for each of the four transitions are derived from the information available in the characteristic table. The symbol X in the tables represents a dont-care condition, which means that it does not matter whether the input is 1 or 0.    The excitation table for the JK flip-flop is shown in part (a). When both present state and next state are 0, the J input must remain at 0 and the K input can be either 0 or 1. Similarly, when both present state and next state are 1, the K input must remain at 0,                              Section 5.8 Design Procedure 241 Table 5.12 Flip-Flop Excitation Tables Q(t) Q(t  1) J K             Q ( t )  Q(t  1) T 0  0  0 X                      0      0                0                                0 0  1  1 X                      1      1                1                                1 1  0  X 1                             0                1 1  1  X 0                             1                0    (a) JK Flip-Flop                   (b) T Flip-Flop             while the J input can be 0 or 1. If the flip-flop is to have a transition from the 0-state             to the 1-state, J must be equal to 1, since the J input sets the flip-flop. However, input             K may be either 0 or 1. If K = 0, the J = 1 condition sets the flip-flop as required; if             K = 1 and J = 1, the flip-flop is complemented and goes from the 0-state to the             1-state as required. Therefore, the K input is marked with a dont-care condition for the             0-to-1 transition. For a transition from the 1-state to the 0-state, we must have K = 1,             since the K input clears the flip-flop. However, the J input may be either 0 or 1, since             J = 0 has no effect and J = 1 together with K = 1 complements the flip-flop with a             resultant transition from the 1-state to the 0-state.                 The excitation table for the T flip-flop is shown in part (b). From the characteristic             table, we find that when input T = 1, the state of the flip-flop is complemented, and             when T = 0, the state of the flip-flop remains unchanged. Therefore, when the state of             the flip-flop must remain the same, the requirement is that T = 0. When the state of the             flip-flop has to be complemented, T must equal 1. Synthesis Using JK Flip-Flops             The manual synthesis procedure for sequential circuits with JK flip-flops is the same as             with D flip-flops, except that the input equations must be evaluated from the present-             state to the next-state transition derived from the excitation table. To illustrate the pro-             cedure, we will synthesize the sequential circuit specified by Table 5.13. In addition to             having columns for the present state, input, and next state, as in a conventional state table,             the table shows the flip-flop input conditions from which the input equations are derived.             The flip-flop inputs are derived from the state table in conjunction with the excitation             table for the JK flip-flop. For example, in the first row of Table 5.13, we have a transition             for flip-flop A from 0 in the present state to 0 in the next state. In Table 5.12, for the JK             flip-flop, we find that a transition of states from present state 0 to next state 0 requires             that input J be 0 and input K be a dont-care. So 0 and X are entered in the first row under             JA and KA, respectively. Since the first row also shows a transition for flip-flop B from 0             in the present state to 0 in the next state, 0 and X are inserted into the first row under JB             and KB, respectively. The second row of the table shows a transition for flip-flop B from             0 in the present state to 1 in the next state. From the excitation table, we find that a tran-             sition from 0 to 1 requires that J be 1 and K be a dont-care, so 1 and X are copied into    Table 5.13    State Table and JK Flip-Flop Inputs    Present                  Input                 Next               Flip-Flop Inputs     State                                         State                                                                     JA KA JB KB    A               B              x               A B                                                                     0 X0 X    0               0              0               0 0               0 X1 X                                                                     1 XX1    0               0              1               0 1               0 XX0                                                                     X0 0 X    0               1              0               1 0               X0 1 X                                                                     X0 X0    0               1              1               0 1               X1 X1    1               0              0               1 0    1               0              1               1 1    1               1              0               1 1    1               1              1               0 0 the second row under JB and KB, respectively. The process is continued for each row in the table and for each flip-flop, with the input conditions from the excitation table copied into the proper row of the particular flip-flop being considered.    The flip-flop inputs in Table 5.13 specify the truth table for the input equations as a function of present state A, present state B, and input x. The input equations are simpli- fied in the maps of Fig. 5.30.The next-state values are not used during the simplification,    Bx                                B                      Bx                      B A      00               01    11              10  A             00    01     11       10        m0             m1    m3              m2                  m0  m1     m3       m2    0                  m5                       1            0X         X     X         X             m4          X   m7              m6                m4    m5     m7       m6 A1 X                          X               X   A1                            1                                x                                             x                       JA  Bx                                        KA  Bx                                      B                                              B A  Bx                                                    A  Bx                00       01    11              10                00    01     11       10        m0             m1    m3              m2                  m0  m1     m3       m2    0                     1     X              X             0X         X               1            m4         m5    m2              m6                  m4  m5     m7       m6 A1                       1     X              X   A1 X                  X       1                                          x                                       x                                  JB  x                              KB  (A  x) FIGURE 5.30 Maps for J and K input equations                                            Section 5.8 Design Procedure 243 x                                                 J       A                                                    Clk                                                 K       A                                                 J       B                                                    Clk                                                 K       B                                                                                       Clock                   FIGURE 5.31                   Logic diagram for sequential circuit with JK flip-flops             since the input equations are a function of the present state and the input only. Note the             advantage of using JK-type flip-flops when sequential circuits are designed manually.             The fact that there are so many dont-care entries indicates that the combinational cir-             cuit for the input equations is likely to be simpler, because dont-care minterms usually             help in obtaining simpler expressions. If there are unused states in the state table, there             will be additional dont-care conditions in the map. Nonetheless, D-type flip-flops are             more amenable to an automated design flow.                 The four input equations for the pair of JK flip-flops are listed under the maps of             Fig. 5.30. The logic diagram (schematic) of the sequential circuit is drawn in Fig. 5.31. Synthesis Using T Flip-Flops             The procedure for synthesizing circuits using T flip-flops will be demonstrated by design-             ing a binary counter. An n-bit binary counter consists of n flip-flops that can count in             binary from 0 to 2n - 1. The state diagram of a three-bit counter is shown in Fig. 5.32. As              000         001                                111    010                                          110         011                                101              100 FIGURE 5.32 State diagram of three-bit binary counter             seen from the binary states indicated inside the circles, the flip-flop outputs repeat the             binary count sequence with a return to 000 after 111. The directed lines between circles             are not marked with input and output values as in other state diagrams. Remember that             state transitions in clocked sequential circuits are initiated by a clock edge; the flip-flops             remain in their present states if no clock is applied. For that reason, the clock does not             appear explicitly as an input variable in a state diagram or state table. From this point of             view, the state diagram of a counter does not have to show input and output values along             the directed lines. The only input to the circuit is the clock, and the outputs are specified             by the present state of the flip-flops. The next state of a counter depends entirely on its             present state, and the state transition occurs every time the clock goes through a transition.                 Table 5.14 is the state table for the three-bit binary counter. The three flip-flops are             symbolized by A2, A1, and A0. Binary counters are constructed most efficiently with T             flip-flops because of their complement property. The flip-flop excitation for the T inputs             is derived from the excitation table of the T flip-flop and by inspection of the state             transition of the present state to the next state. As an illustration, consider the flip-flop             input entries for row 001. The present state here is 001 and the next state is 010, which             is the next count in the sequence. Comparing these two counts, we note that A2 goes             from 0 to 0, so TA2 is marked with 0 because flip-flop A2 must not change when a clock             occurs. Also, A1 goes from 0 to 1, so TA1 is marked with a 1 because this flip-flop must             be complemented in the next clock edge. Similarly, A0 goes from 1 to 0, indicating that             it must be complemented, so TA0 is marked with a 1. The last row, with present state 111,             is compared with the first count 000, which is its next state. Going from all 1s to all 0s             requires that all three flip-flops be complemented.                 The flip-flop input equations are simplified in the maps of Fig. 5.33. Note that TA0             has 1s in all eight minterms because the least significant bit of the counter is comple-             mented with each count. A Boolean function that includes all minterms defines a             constant value of 1. The input equations listed under each map specify the combina-             tional part of the counter. Including these functions with the three flip-flops, we obtain Table 5.14 State Table for Three-Bit Counter Present State  Next State          Flip-Flop Inputs A2 A1 A0       A2 A1 A0            TA2 TA1 TA0 0  0  0        0 0 1                 0 0 1                0 1 0                 0 1 1 0  0  1        0 1 1                 0 0 1                1 0 0                 1 1 1 0  1  0        1 0 1                 0 0 1                1 1 0                 0 1 1 0  1  1        1 1 1                 0 1 1                0 0 0                 1 1 1 1  0  0 1  0  1 1  1  0 1  1  1                                                                                                                          Problems 245     A1A0                              A1        A1A0                                    A1                  A1A0                           A1 A2               00    01    11         10  A2                      00    01     11       10            A2        00       01          11    10        m0            m1    m3         m2           m0                   m1    m3        m2                  m0           m1          m3    m2     0                m5       1                 0                          1     1                          01              1           1     1              m4            m7         m6                 m4             m5    m7        m6                           m4  m5          m7    m6 A2 1                               1        A2 1                           1         1                  A2 1 1              1           1     1                                A0                                                A0                                               x                      TA2  A1A0                                          TA1  A0                                          TA0  1                      FIGURE 5.33                      Maps for three-bit binary counter                                                    A2                                         A1                               A0                                                    Clk                                  Clk                       Clk                                                                  T                                   T                         T                                                                                                                                 1                                    Clock                      FIGURE 5.34                      Logic diagram of three-bit binary counter                      the logic diagram of the counter, as shown in Fig. 5.34.

PROBLEMS               (Answers to problems marked with * appear at the end of the book. Where appropriate, a logic               design and its related HDL modeling problem are cross-referenced.)               Note: For each problem that requires writing and verifying an HDL model, a test plan should be               written to identify which functional features are to be tested during the simulation and how they               will be tested. For example, a reset on the fly could be tested by asserting the reset signal while               the simulated machine is in a state other than the reset state. The test plan is to guide development               of a test bench that will implement the plan. Simulate the model, using the test bench, and verify               that the behavior is correct. If synthesis tools and an ASIC cell library are available, the Verilog               descriptions developed for Problems 5.34C5.42 can be assigned as synthesis exercises. The gate-               level circuit produced by the synthesis tools should be simulated and compared to the simulation               results for the pre-synthesis model. The same exercises can be assigned if an FPGA tool suite is               available. 5.1   The D latch of Fig. 5.6 is constructed with four NAND gates and an inverter. Consider the       following three other ways for obtaining a D latch. In each case, draw the logic diagram 5.2   and verify the circuit operation. 5.3   (a) Use NOR gates for the SR latch part and AND gates for the other two. An inverter 5.4 5.5         may be needed. 5.6   (b) Use NOR gates for all four gates. Inverters may be needed.       (c) Use four NAND gates only (without an inverter). This can be done by connecting 5.7*             the output of the upper gate in Fig. 5.6 (the gate that goes to the SR latch) to the input             of the lower gate (instead of the inverter output).

A circuit with flip\\\\flops is       considered a sequential circuit even in the absence of combinational gates. Circuits that       include flip\\\\flops are usually classified by the function they perform rather than by the name       of the sequential circuit. Two such circuits are registers and counters.          A register is a group of flip\\\\flops, each one of which shares a common clock and is       capable of storing one bit of information. An n\\\\bit register consists of a group of n       flip\\\\flops capable of storing n bits of binary information. In addition to the flip\\\\flops, a       register may have combinational gates that perform certain data\\\\processing tasks. In       its broadest definition, a register consists of a group of flip\\\\flops together with gates       that affect their operation. The flip\\\\flops hold the binary information, and the gates       determine how the information is transferred into the register.          A counter is essentially a register that goes through a predetermined sequence of       binary states. The gates in the counter are connected in such a way as to produce the       prescribed sequence of states. Although counters are a special type of register, it is       common to differentiate them by giving them a different name.          Various types of registers are available commercially. The simplest register is one that       consists of only flip\\\\flops, without any gates. Figure 6.1 shows such a register constructed       with four D\\\\type flip\\\\flops to form a four\\\\bit data storage register. The common clock       input triggers all flip\\\\flops on the positive edge of each pulse, and the binary data available       at the four inputs are transferred into the register. The value of (I3, I2, I1, I0) immediately       before the clock edge determines the value of (A3, A2, A1, A0) after the clock edge.The four                         255                     I0                 D        A0                                           C                                              R                     I1                 D        A1                                           C                                              R                     I2                 D        A2                                           C                                              R                     I3                 D        A3                                           C                                              R                         Clock Clear_b FIGURE 6.1 Four\\\\bit register outputs can be sampled at any time to obtain the binary information stored in the register. The input Clear_b goes to the active\\\\low R (reset) input of all four flip\\\\flops. When this input goes to 0, all flip\\\\flops are reset asynchronously. The Clear_b input is useful for clear- ing the register to all 0s prior to its clocked operation. The R inputs must be maintained                                                                                   Section 6.1 Registers 257             at logic 1 (i.e., de-asserted) during normal clocked operation. Note that, depending on the             flip\\\\flop, either Clear, Clear_b, reset, or reset_b can be used to indicate the transfer of the             register to an all 0s state. Register with Parallel Load             Registers with parallel load are a fundamental building block in digital systems. It is             important that you have a thorough understanding of their behavior. Synchronous dig-             ital systems have a master clock generator that supplies a continuous train of clock             pulses. The pulses are applied to all flip\\\\flops and registers in the system. The master             clock acts like a drum that supplies a constant beat to all parts of the system. A separate             control signal must be used to decide which register operation will execute at each clock             pulse. The transfer of new information into a register is referred to as loading or updat-             ing the register. If all the bits of the register are loaded simultaneously with a common             clock pulse, we say that the loading is done in parallel. A clock edge applied to the C             inputs of the register of Fig. 6.1 will load all four inputs in parallel. In this configuration,             if the contents of the register must be left unchanged, the inputs must be held constant             or the clock must be inhibited from the circuit. In the first case, the data bus driving the             register would be unavailable for other traffic. In the second case, the clock can be             inhibited from reaching the register by controlling the clock input signal with an enabling             gate. However, inserting gates into the clock path is ill advised because it means that             logic is performed with clock pulses. The insertion of logic gates produces uneven prop-             agation delays between the master clock and the inputs of flip\\\\flops. To fully synchronize             the system, we must ensure that all clock pulses arrive at the same time anywhere in the             system, so that all flip\\\\flops trigger simultaneously. Performing logic with clock pulses             inserts variable delays and may cause the system to go out of synchronism. For this             reason, it is advisable to control the operation of the register with the D inputs, rather             than controlling the clock in the C inputs of the flip\\\\flops. This creates the effect of a             gated clock, but without affecting the clock path of the circuit.                 A four\\\\bit data\\\\storage register with a load control input that is directed through gates             and into the D inputs of the flip\\\\flops is shown in Fig. 6.2.The additional gates implement             a two\\\\channel mux whose output drives the input to the register with either the data bus             or the output of the register. The load input to the register determines the action to be             taken with each clock pulse. When the load input is 1, the data at the four external inputs             are transferred into the register with the next positive edge of the clock. When the load             input is 0, the outputs of the flip\\\\flops are connected to their respective inputs. The feed-             back connection from output to input is necessary because a D flip\\\\flop does not have             a no change condition. With each clock edge, the D input determines the next state of             the register. To leave the output unchanged, it is necessary to make the D input equal to             the present value of the output (i.e., the output circulates to the input at each clock             pulse). The clock pulses are applied to the C inputs without interruption. The load input             determines whether the next pulse will accept new information or leave the information             in the register intact. The transfer of information from the data inputs or the outputs of             the register is done simultaneously with all four bits in response to a clock edge.

The logical configuration of a shift       register consists of a chain of flip\\\\flops in cascade, with the output of one flip\\\\flop con-       nected to the input of the next flip\\\\flop. All flip\\\\flops receive common clock pulses,       which activate the shift of data from one stage to the next.          The simplest possible shift register is one that uses only flip\\\\flops, as shown in Fig. 6.3.       The output of a given flip\\\\flop is connected to the D input of the flip\\\\flop at its right. This       shift register is unidirectional (left\\\\to\\\\right). Each clock pulse shifts the contents of the                        Section 6.2 Shift Registers 259 Serial SI  D     D     D     D     SO Serial input                              output               C     C     C     C            CLK     FIGURE 6.3     Four\\\\bit shift register register one bit position to the right. The configuration does not support a left shift. The serial input determines what goes into the leftmost flip\\\\flop during the shift. The serial output is taken from the output of the rightmost flip\\\\flop. Sometimes it is necessary to control the shift so that it occurs only with certain pulses, but not with others. As with the data register discussed in the previous section, the clocks signal can be suppressed by gat- ing the clock signal to prevent the register from shifting. A preferred alternative in high\\\\ speed circuits is to suppress the clock action, rather than gate the clock signal, by leaving the clock path unchanged, but recirculating the output of each register cell back through a two\\\\channel mux whose output is connected to the input of the cell. When the clock action is not suppressed, the other channel of the mux provides a datapath to the cell.    It will be shown later that the shift operation can be controlled through the D inputs of the flip\\\\flops rather than through the clock input. If, however, the shift register of Fig. 6.3 is used, the shift can be controlled with an input by connecting the clock through an AND gate. This is not a preferred practice. Note that the simplified schematics do not show a reset signal, but such a signal is required in practical designs. Serial Transfer             The datapath of a digital system is said to operate in serial mode when information             is transferred and manipulated one bit at a time. Information is transferred one bit at             a time by shifting the bits out of the source register and into the destination register.             This type of transfer is in contrast to parallel transfer, whereby all the bits of the             register are transferred at the same time.                 The serial transfer of information from register A to register B is done with shift             registers, as shown in the block diagram of Fig. 6.4(a). The serial output (SO) of register             A is connected to the serial input (SI) of register B. To prevent the loss of information             stored in the source register, the information in register A is made to circulate by con-             necting the serial output to its serial input. The initial content of register B is shifted out             through its serial output and is lost unless it is transferred to a third shift register. The             shift control input determines when and how many times the registers are shifted. For             illustration here, this is done with an AND gate that allows clock pulses to pass into the             CLK terminals only when the shift control is active. (This practice can be problematic             because it may compromise the clock path of the circuit, as discussed earlier.)                 Suppose the shift registers in Fig. 6.4 have four bits each. Then the control unit that             supervises the transfer of data must be designed in such a way that it enables the shift               SIA                              SOA SIB     Shift register B  SOB                       Shift register A                                  CLK                       CLK  Clock  Shift control                                       (a) Block diagram Clock  Shift control          CLK                          T1 T2 T3 T4                                        (b) Timing diagram FIGURE 6.4 Serial transfer from register A to register B registers, through the shift control signal, for a fixed time of four clock pulses in order to pass an entire word.This design is shown in the timing diagram of Fig. 6.4(b).The shift control signal is synchronized with the clock and changes value just after the negative edge of the clock. The next four clock pulses find the shift control signal in the active state, so the output of the AND gate connected to the CLK inputs produces four pulses: T1, T2, T3, and T4. Each rising edge of the pulse causes a shift in both registers. The fourth pulse changes the shift control to 0, and the shift registers are disabled.    Assume that the binary content of A before the shift is 1011 and that of B is 0010. The serial transfer from A to B occurs in four steps, as shown in Table 6.1. With the first pulse, T1, the rightmost bit of A is shifted into the leftmost bit of B and is also circulated into the leftmost position of A. At the same time, all bits of A and B are shifted one position to the right. The previous serial output from B in the rightmost position is lost, and its value changes from 0 to 1. The next three pulses perform identical operations, shifting the bits of A into B, one at a time. After the fourth shift, the shift control goes to 0, and registers A and B both have the value 1011. Thus, the contents of A are copied into B, so that the contents of A remain unchanged i.e., the contents of A are restored to their original value.    The difference between the serial and the parallel mode of operation should be appar- ent from this example. In the parallel mode, information is available from all bits of a register and all bits can be transferred simultaneously during one clock pulse.

The information             is transferred one bit at a time while the registers are shifted in the same direction. Serial Addition             Operations in digital computers are usually done in parallel because that is a faster             mode of operation. Serial operations are slower because a datapath operation takes             several clock cycles, but serial operations have the advantage of requiring fewer hard-             ware components. In VLSI circuits, they require less silicon area on a chip. To demon-             strate the serial mode of operation, we present the design of a serial adder. The parallel             counterpart was presented in Section 4.4.                 The two binary numbers to be added serially are stored in two shift registers. Begin-             ning with the least significant pair of bits, the circuit adds one pair at a time through a             single full\\\\adder (FA) circuit, as shown in Fig. 6.5.The carry out of the full adder is trans-             ferred to a D flip\\\\flop, the output of which is then used as the carry input for the next             pair of significant bits. The sum bit from the S output of the full adder could be trans-             ferred into a third shift register. By shifting the sum into A while the bits of A are shifted             out, it is possible to use one register for storing both the augend and the sum bits. The             serial input of register B can be used to transfer a new binary number while the addend             bits are shifted out during the addition.                 The operation of the serial adder is as follows: Initially, register A holds the augend,             register B holds the addend, and the carry flip\\\\flop is cleared to 0. The outputs (SO) of A             and B provide a pair of significant bits for the full adder at x and y. Output Q of the flip\\\\flop             provides the input carry at z. The shift control enables both registers and the carry flip\\\\flop,             so at the next clock pulse, both registers are shifted once to the right, the sum bit from S             enters the leftmost flip\\\\flop of A, and the output carry is transferred into flip\\\\flop Q. The             shift control enables the registers for a number of clock pulses equal to the number of bits             in the registers. For each succeeding clock pulse, a new sum bit is transferred to A, a new             carry is transferred to Q, and both registers are shifted once to the right. This process con-             tinues until the shift control is disabled. Thus, the addition is accomplished by passing each             pair of bits together with the previous carry through a single full\\\\adder circuit and transfer-             ring the sum, one bit at a time, into register A.                 Initially, register A and the carry flip\\\\flop are cleared to 0, and then the first number             is added from B. While B is shifted through the full adder, a second number is transferred  Shift   SI                           SO control          Shift register A   CLK          (Augend)                                           x                     S                                           y FA Serial   SI                           SO  z                     C input          Shift register B          (Addend)                                                   Q                                                              D                                                            C                                           Clear     FIGURE 6.5     Serial adder to it through its serial input. The second number is then added to the contents of register A, while a third number is transferred serially into register B. This can be repeated to perform the addition of two, three, or more four\\\\bit numbers and accumulate their sum in register A.    Comparing the serial adder with the parallel adder described in Section 4.4, we note several differences. The parallel adder uses registers with a parallel load, whereas the serial adder uses shift registers. The number of full\\\\adder circuits in the parallel adder is equal to the number of bits in the binary numbers, whereas the serial adder requires only one full\\\\adder circuit and a carry flip\\\\flop. Excluding the registers, the parallel adder is a combinational circuit, whereas the serial adder is a sequential circuit which consists of a full adder and a flip\\\\flop that stores the output carry. This design is typical in serial operations because the result of a bit\\\\time operation may depend not only on the present inputs, but also on previous inputs that must be stored in flip\\\\flops.    To show that serial operations can be designed by means of sequential circuit proce- dure, we will redesign the serial adder with the use of a state table. First, we assume that two shift registers are available to store the binary numbers to be added serially. The serial outputs from the registers are designated by x and y. The sequential circuit to be designed will not include the shift registers, but they will be inserted later to show the complete circuit. The sequential circuit proper has the two inputs, x and y, that provide a pair of significant bits, an output S that generates the sum bit, and flip\\\\flop Q for storing the carry. The state table that specifies the sequential circuit is listed in Table 6.2. The present state of Q is the present value of the carry.

The next             state of Q is equal to the output carry. Note that the state table entries are identical             to the entries in a full\\\\adder truth table, except that the input carry is now the present             state of Q and the output carry is now the next state of Q.                 If a D flip\\\\flop is used for Q, the circuit reduces to the one shown in Fig. 6.5. If a JK flip\\\\             flop is used for Q, it is necessary to determine the values of inputs J and K by referring to             the excitation table (Table 5.12). This is done in the last two columns of Table 6.2. The two             flip\\\\flop input equations and the output equation can be simplified by means of maps to                                                        JQ = xy                                                       KQ = xy = (x + y)                                                          S = x{y{Q             The circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 6.6. The circuit consists of three gates and a JK             flip\\\\flop. The two shift registers are included in the diagram to show the complete serial             adder. Note that output S is a function not only of x and y, but also of the present state             of Q. The next state of Q is a function of the present state of Q and of the values of x             and y that come out of the serial outputs of the shift registers. Universal Shift Register             If the flip\\\\flop outputs of a shift register are accessible, then information entered serially             by shifting can be taken out in parallel from the outputs of the flip\\\\flops. If a parallel             load capability is added to a shift register, then data entered in parallel can be taken out             in serial fashion by shifting the data stored in the register.                 Some shift registers provide the necessary input and output terminals for parallel             transfer. They may also have both shift\\\\right and shift\\\\left capabilities. The most general             shift register has the following capabilities:                 1. A clear control to clear the register to 0.                 2. A clock input to synchronize the operations.                         coSnhtirftol SShI ift registerSAO x S                            CLK Serial  SI                   SO y input   Shift register B                  J                                              C                                           K                                    Clear FIGURE 6.6 Second form of serial adder    3.

A shift\\\\left control to enable the shift\\\\left operation and the serial input and output        lines associated with the shift left.    5.

A control state that leaves the information in the register unchanged in response        to the clock. Other shift registers may have only some of the preceding functions,        with at least one shift operation.    A register capable of shifting in one direction only is a unidirectional shift register. One that can shift in both directions is a bidirectional shift register. If the register has both shifts and parallel\\\\load capabilities, it is referred to as a universal shift register.    The block diagram symbol and the circuit diagram of a four\\\\bit universal shift register that has all the capabilities just listed are shown in Fig. 6.7. The circuit consists of four D flip\\\\flops and four multiplexers. The four multiplexers have two common selection inputs s1 and s0. Input 0 in each multiplexer is selected when s1s0 = 00, input 1 is selected when s1s0 = 01, and similarly for the other two inputs. The selection inputs control the mode of operation of the register according to the function entries in Table 6.3.When s1s0 = 00, the present value of the register is applied to the D inputs of the flip\\\\flops. This condition forms a path from the output of each flip\\\\flop into the input of the same flip\\\\flop, so that the output recirculates to the input in this mode of operation. The next clock edge trans- fers into each flip\\\\flop the binary value it held previously, and no change of state occurs.

This causes a shift\\\\right operation, with the serial input transferred into flip\\\\flop      A3. When s1s0 = 10, a shift\\\\left operation results, with the other serial input going into      flip\\\\flop A0. Finally, when s1s0 = 11, the binary information on the parallel input lines is      transferred into the register simultaneously during the next clock edge. Note that data      enters MSB_in for a shift\\\\right operation and enters LSB_in for a shift\\\\left operation.      Clear_b is an active\\\\low signal that clears all of the flip\\\\flops.         Shift registers are often used to interface digital systems situated remotely from each      other. For example, suppose it is necessary to transmit an n\\\\bit quantity between two      points. If the distance is far, it will be expensive to use n lines to transmit the n bits in      parallel. It is more economical to use a single line and transmit the information serially,      one bit at a time. The transmitter accepts the n\\\\bit data in parallel into a shift register      and then transmits the data serially along the common line. The receiver accepts the      data serially into a shift register. When all n bits are received, they can be taken from      the outputs of the register in parallel. Thus, the transmitter performs a parallel\\\\to\\\\serial      conversion of data and the receiver does a serial\\\\to\\\\parallel conversion. 6.3  RIPPLE COUNTERS       A register that goes through a prescribed sequence of states upon the application of input       pulses is called a counter. The input pulses may be clock pulses, or they may originate       from some external source and may occur at a fixed interval of time or at random. The       sequence of states may follow the binary number sequence or any other sequence of       states. A counter that follows the binary number sequence is called a binary counter. An       n\\\\bit binary counter consists of n flip\\\\flops and can count in binary from 0 through 2n - 1.          Counters are available in two categories: ripple counters and synchronous counters.       In a ripple counter, a flip\\\\flop output transition serves as a source for triggering other       flip\\\\flops. In other words, the C input of some or all flip\\\\flops are triggered, not by the       common clock pulses, but rather by the transition that occurs in other flip\\\\flop outputs.       In a synchronous counter, the C inputs of all flip\\\\flops receive the common clock.       Synchronous counters are presented in the next two sections. Here, we present the       binary and BCD ripple counters and explain their operation.                                                                         Section 6.3 Ripple Counters 267 Binary Ripple Counter             A binary ripple counter consists of a series connection of complementing flip\\\\flops, with             the output of each flip\\\\flop connected to the C input of the next higher order flip\\\\flop.             The flip\\\\flop holding the least significant bit receives the incoming count pulses. A com-             plementing flip\\\\flop can be obtained from a JK flip\\\\flop with the J and K inputs tied             together or from a T flip\\\\flop. A third possibility is to use a D flip\\\\flop with the complement             output connected to the D input. In this way, the D input is always the complement of             the present state, and the next clock pulse will cause the flip\\\\flop to complement. The             logic diagram of two 4\\\\bit binary ripple counters is shown in Fig. 6.8. The counter is con-             structed with complementing flip\\\\flops of the T type in part (a) and D type in part (b).             The output of each flip\\\\flop is connected to the C input of the next flip\\\\flop in sequence.             The flip\\\\flop holding the least significant bit receives the incoming count pulses. The T             inputs of all the flip\\\\flops in (a) are connected to a permanent logic 1, making each flip\\\\             flop complement if the signal in its C input goes through a negative transition. The bub-             ble in front of the dynamic indicator symbol next to C indicates that the flip\\\\flops respond             to the negative\\\\edge transition of the input. The negative transition occurs when the             output of the previous flip\\\\flop to which C is connected goes from 1 to 0.                 To understand the operation of the four\\\\bit binary ripple counter, refer to the first             nine binary numbers listed in Table 6.4. The count starts with binary 0 and increments             by 1 with each count pulse input. After the count of 15, the counter goes back to 0 to             repeat the count. The least significant bit, A0, is complemented with each count pulse             input. Every time that A0 goes from 1 to 0, it complements A1. Every time that A1 goes             from 1 to 0, it complements A2. Every time that A2 goes from 1 to 0, it complements A3,             and so on for any other higher order bits of a ripple counter. For example, consider the             transition from count 0011 to 0100. A0 is complemented with the count pulse. Since A0             goes from 1 to 0, it triggers A1 and complements it. As a result, A1 goes from 1 to 0, which             in turn complements A2, changing it from 0 to 1. A2 does not trigger A3, because A2             produces a positive transition and the flip\\\\flop responds only to negative transitions.             Thus, the count from 0011 to 0100 is achieved by changing the bits one at a time, so the Table 6.4 Binary Count Sequence A 3  A 2               A 1  A 0 0    0                 0    0 0    0                 0    1 0    0                 1    0 0    0                 1    1 0    1                 0    0 0    1                 0    1 0    1                 1    0 0    1                 1    1 1    0                 0    0 T                                     A0         D                      A0 Count C R                                 Count     CR T                                     A1         D                      A1    CR                                               CR T                                     A2         D                      A2    CR                                               CR T                                     A3         D                      A3    CR                                               CR         Logic 1                           Reset Reset                                                  (b) With D flip-flops                (a) With T flip-flops FIGURE 6.8 Four\\\\bit binary ripple counter                                                                         Section 6.3 Ripple Counters 269             count goes from 0011 to 0010, then to 0000, and finally to 0100. The flip\\\\flops change             one at a time in succession, and the signal propagates through the counter in a ripple             fashion from one stage to the next.                 A binary counter with a reverse count is called a binary countdown counter. In a             countdown counter, the binary count is decremented by 1 with every input count pulse.             The count of a four\\\\bit countdown counter starts from binary 15 and continues to binary             counts 14, 13, 12, . . . , 0 and then back to 15. A list of the count sequence of a binary             countdown counter shows that the least significant bit is complemented with every count             pulse. Any other bit in the sequence is complemented if its previous least significant bit             goes from 0 to 1. Therefore, the diagram of a binary countdown counter looks the same             as the binary ripple counter in Fig. 6.8, provided that all flip\\\\flops trigger on the positive             edge of the clock. (The bubble in the C inputs must be absent.) If negative\\\\edge\\\\triggered             flip\\\\flops are used, then the C input of each flip\\\\flop must be connected to the comple-             mented output of the previous flip\\\\flop. Then, when the true output goes from 0 to 1, the             complement will go from 1 to 0 and complement the next flip\\\\flop as required. BCD Ripple Counter             A decimal counter follows a sequence of 10 states and returns to 0 after the count of 9.             Such a counter must have at least four flip\\\\flops to represent each decimal digit, since             a decimal digit is represented by a binary code with at least four bits. The sequence of             states in a decimal counter is dictated by the binary code used to represent a decimal             digit. If BCD is used, the sequence of states is as shown in the state diagram of Fig. 6.9.             A decimal counter is similar to a binary counter, except that the state after 1001 (the             code for decimal digit 9) is 0000 (the code for decimal digit 0).                 The logic diagram of a BCD ripple counter using JK flip\\\\flops is shown in Fig. 6.10.             The four outputs are designated by the letter symbol Q, with a numeric subscript equal             to the binary weight of the corresponding bit in the BCD code. Note that the output of             Q1 is applied to the C inputs of both Q2 and Q8 and the output of Q2 is applied to the             C input of Q4. The J and K inputs are connected either to a permanent 1 signal or to             outputs of other flip\\\\flops.                 A ripple counter is an asynchronous sequential circuit. Signals that affect the flip\\\\flop             transition depend on the way they change from 1 to 0.

These condi- tions are derived from the logic diagram and from knowledge of how a JK flip\\\\flop operates. Remember that when the C input goes from 1 to 0, the flip\\\\flop is set if J = 1, is cleared if K = 1, is complemented if J = K = 1, and is left unchanged if J = K = 0.

Q1 changes state after each clock      pulse. Q2 complements every time Q1 goes from 1 to 0, as long as Q8 = 0. When Q8      becomes 1, Q2 remains at 0. Q4 complements every time Q2 goes from 1 to 0. Q8 remains      at 0 as long as Q2 or Q4 is 0. When both Q2 and Q4 become 1, Q8 complements when Q1      goes from 1 to 0. Q8 is cleared on the next transition of Q1.         The BCD counter of Fig. 6.10 is a decade counter, since it counts from 0 to 9. To      count in decimal from 0 to 99, we need a two\\\\decade counter. To count from 0 to 999,      we need a three\\\\decade counter. Multiple decade counters can be constructed by con-      necting BCD counters in cascade, one for each decade. A three\\\\decade counter is      shown in Fig. 6.11. The inputs to the second and third decades come from Q8 of the      previous decade. When Q8 in one decade goes from 1 to 0, it triggers the count for the      next higher order decade while its own decade goes from 9 to 0. 6.4  SYNCHRONOUS COUNTERS       Synchronous counters are different from ripple counters in that clock pulses are applied       to the inputs of all flip\\\\flops. A common clock triggers all flip\\\\flops simultaneously,       rather than one at a time in succession as in a ripple counter. The decision whether a       flip\\\\flop is to be complemented is determined from the values of the data inputs, such       as T or J and K at the time of the clock edge. If T = 0 or J = K = 0, the flip\\\\flop does       not change state. If T = 1 or J = K = 1, the flip\\\\flop complements.          The design procedure for synchronous counters was presented in Section 5.8, and the       design of a three\\\\bit binary counter was carried out in conjunction with Fig. 5.31. In this       section, we present some typical synchronous counters and explain their operation. Binary Counter             The design of a synchronous binary counter is so simple that there is no need to go             through a sequential logic design process. In a synchronous binary counter, the flip\\\\flop             in the least significant position is complemented with every pulse. A flip\\\\flop in any other             position is complemented when all the bits in the lower significant positions are equal to 1.             For example, if the present state of a four\\\\bit counter is A3A2A1A0 = 0011, the next             count is 0100. A0 is always complemented. A1 is complemented because the present             state of A0 = 1. A2 is complemented because the present state of A1A0 = 11. However,             A3 is not complemented, because the present state of A2A1A0 = 011, which does not             give an all\\\\1s condition.                 Synchronous binary counters have a regular pattern and can be constructed with             complementing flip\\\\flops and gates. The regular pattern can be seen from the four\\\\bit             counter depicted in Fig. 6.12. The C inputs of all flip\\\\flops are connected to a common             clock. The counter is enabled by Count_enable. If the enable input is 0, all J and K inputs             are equal to 0 and the clock does not change the state of the counter. The first stage,             A0, has its J and K equal to 1 if the counter is enabled. The other J and K inputs are             equal to 1 if all previous least significant stages are equal to 1 and the count is enabled.             The chain of AND gates generates the required logic for the J and K inputs in each             stage. The counter can be extended to any number of stages, with each stage having an             additional flip\\\\flop and an AND gate that gives an output of 1 if all previous flip\\\\flop             outputs are 1.                 Note that the flip\\\\flops trigger on the positive edge of the clock. The polarity of the             clock is not essential here, but it is with the ripple counter. The synchronous counter can             be triggered with either the positive or the negative clock edge. The complementing             flip\\\\flops in a binary counter can be of either the JK type, the T type, or the D type with             XOR gates. The equivalency of the three types is indicated in Fig. 5.13. UpCDown Binary Counter             A synchronous countdown binary counter goes through the binary states in reverse order,             from 1111 down to 0000 and back to 1111 to repeat the count. It is possible to design a             countdown counter in the usual manner, but the result is predictable by inspection of the             downward binary count. The bit in the least significant position is complemented with each             pulse. A bit in any other position is complemented if all lower significant bits are equal to 0.             For example, the next state after the present state of 0100 is 0011. The least significant             bit is always complemented. The second significant bit is complemented because the first             bit is 0. The third significant bit is complemented because the first two bits are equal to 0.             But the fourth bit does not change, because not all lower significant bits are equal to 0.                 A countdown binary counter can be constructed as shown in Fig. 6.12, except that             the inputs to the AND gates must come from the complemented outputs, instead of             the normal outputs, of the previous flip\\\\flops. The two operations can be combined in             one circuit to form a counter capable of counting either up or down. The circuit of an             upCdown binary counter using T flip\\\\flops is shown in Fig. 6.13. It has an up control             input and a down control input. When the up input is 1, the circuit counts up, since the             T inputs receive their signals from the values of the previous normal outputs of the             flip\\\\flops. When the down input is 1 and the up input is 0, the circuit counts down,             since the complemented outputs of the previous flip\\\\flops are applied to the T inputs.             When the up and down inputs are both 0, the circuit does not change state and remains               Section 6.4 Synchronous Counters 273               J                                                                    A0                  C Count_enable  K               J                                                                    A1                  C               K               J                                                                    A2                  C               K                                                                               J       A3                                                                                 C  To next stage                                                                               K                                                                   CLK FIGURE 6.12 Four\\\\bit synchronous binary counter        Up    Down                                                                                          C                                                                                       T     A1                                                                                          C                                                                                       T     A2                                                                                          C                                                                                       T     A3                                                                                          C                                                                                  CLK FIGURE 6.13 Four\\\\bit upCdown binary counter                                                                Section 6.4 Synchronous Counters 275             in the same count. When the up and down inputs are both 1, the circuit counts up. This             set of conditions ensures that only one operation is performed at any given time. Note             that the up input has priority over the down input. BCD Counter             A BCD counter counts in binary\\\\coded decimal from 0000 to 1001 and back to 0000.             Because of the return to 0 after a count of 9, a BCD counter does not have a regular             pattern, unlike a straight binary count. To derive the circuit of a BCD synchronous             counter, it is necessary to go through a sequential circuit design procedure.                 The state table of a BCD counter is listed in Table 6.5. The input conditions for the             T flip\\\\flops are obtained from the present\\\\ and next\\\\state conditions. Also shown in the             table is an output y, which is equal to 1 when the present state is 1001. In this way, y can             enable the count of the next\\\\higher significant decade while the same pulse switches the             present decade from 1001 to 0000.                 The flip\\\\flop input equations can be simplified by means of maps. The unused states             for minterms 10 to 15 are taken as dont\\\\care terms. The simplified functions are                                                      TQ1 = 1                                                      TQ2 = Q8Q1                                                      TQ4 = Q2Q1                                                      TQ8 = Q8Q1 + Q4Q2Q1                                                         y = Q8Q1                 The circuit can easily be drawn with four T flip\\\\flops, five AND gates, and one OR             gate. Synchronous BCD counters can be cascaded to form a counter for decimal numbers             of any length. The cascading is done as in Fig. 6.11, except that output y must be con-             nected to the count input of the next\\\\higher significant decade.

Figure 6.14 shows the top\\\\level block diagram symbol and the logic diagram of a four\\\\bit             register that has a parallel load capability and can operate as a counter. When equal to             1, the input load control disables the count operation and causes a transfer of data from             the four data inputs into the four flip\\\\flops. If both control inputs are 0, clock pulses do             not change the state of the register.                 The carry output becomes a 1 if all the flip\\\\flops are equal to 1 while the count input is             enabled. This is the condition for complementing the flip\\\\flop that holds the next significant             bit. The carry output is useful for expanding the counter to more than four bits. The speed             of the counter is increased when the carry is generated directly from the outputs of all four             flip\\\\flops, because the delay to generate the carry bit is reduced. In going from state 1111             to 0000, only one gate delay occurs, whereas four gate delays occur in the AND gate chain             shown in Fig. 6.12. Similarly, each flip\\\\flop is associated with an AND gate that receives all             previous flip\\\\flop outputs directly instead of connecting the AND gates in a chain.                 The operation of the counter is summarized in Table 6.6. The four control inputs             Clear, CLK, Load, and Countdetermine the next state. The Clear input is asynchro-             nous and, when equal to 0, causes the counter to be cleared regardless of the presence             of clock pulses or other inputs. This relationship is indicated in the table by the X entries,             which symbolize dont\\\\care conditions for the other inputs. The Clear input must be in             the 1 state for all other operations. With the Load and Count inputs both at 0, the out-             puts do not change, even when clock pulses are applied. A Load input of 1 causes a             transfer from inputs I0 - I3 into the register during a positive edge of CLK. The input             data are loaded into the register regardless of the value of the Count input, because the             Count input is inhibited when the Load input is enabled. The Load input must be 0 for             the Count input to control the operation of the counter.                 A counter with a parallel load can be used to generate any desired count sequence.             Figure 6.15 shows two ways in which a counter with a parallel load is used to generate             the BCD count. In each case, the Count control is set to 1 to enable the count through             the CLK input. Also, recall that the Load control inhibits the count and that the clear             operation is independent of other control inputs.                 The AND gate in Fig. 6.15(a) detects the occurrence of state 1001. The counter is             initially cleared to 0, and then the Clear and Count inputs are set to 1, so the counter is             active at all times. As long as the output of the AND gate is 0, each positive\\\\edge clock Table 6.6 Function Table for the Counter of Fig. 6.14   Clear CLK Load Count Function 0  X  X  X Clear to 0 1  c  1  X Load inputs 1  c  0  1 Count next binary state 1  c  0  0 No change                       Section 6.4 Synchronous Counters 277          Count           Load          Data_in                                                                  4-Bit Binary Counter        A_count                      4                                                                                                         4             Clear              CLK                                                                                                  C_out                                                                                   (a) Count  Load                                                                                                      J             A0      I0                                                                                                       C      I1                                                                                                    K                                                                                                            J             A1                                                                                                               C                                                                                                            K     I2                                                                                                     J             A2     I3                                                                                                        C Clear                                                                                                      K CLK                                                                                                            J             A3                                                                              (b)                FIGURE 6.14                                                                                    C                Four\\\\bit binary counter with parallel load                                                                                                            K                                                                                                                          C_out                                        A3 A2 A1 A0      Load                                 Count  1  Clear                           Count  1                                           Clear  1                                  Load  0             Counter                       CLK               Counter                 CLK            of Fig. 6.14                                    of Fig. 6.14      Inputs  0                                               Inputs have no effect                 (a) Using the load input            (b) Using the clear input      FIGURE 6.15      Two ways to achieve a BCD counter using a counter with parallel load      increments the counter by 1. When the output reaches the count of 1001, both A0 and      A3 become 1, making the output of the AND gate equal to 1. This condition activates      the Load input; therefore, on the next clock edge the register does not count, but is      loaded from its four inputs. Since all four inputs are connected to logic 0, an all\\\\0s value      is loaded into the register following the count of 1001. Thus, the circuit goes through the      count from 0000 through 1001 and back to 0000, as is required in a BCD counter.         In Fig. 6.15(b), the NAND gate detects the count of 1010, but as soon as this count      occurs, the register is cleared.The count 1010 has no chance of staying on for any appre-      ciable time, because the register goes immediately to 0. A momentary spike occurs in      output A0 as the count goes from 1010 to 1011 and immediately to 0000. The spike may      be undesirable, and for that reason, this configuration is not recommended. If the coun-      ter has a synchronous clear input, it is possible to clear the counter with the clock after      an occurrence of the 1001 count. 6.5  OTHER COUNTERS       Counters can be designed to generate any desired sequence of states. A divide\\\\by\\\\N       counter (also known as a modulo\\\\N counter) is a counter that goes through a repeated       sequence of N states. The sequence may follow the binary count or may be any other       arbitrary sequence. Counters are used to generate timing signals to control the sequence       of operations in a digital system. Counters can also be constructed by means of shift       registers. In this section, we present a few examples of nonbinary counters. Counter with Unused States             A circuit with n flip\\\\flops has 2n binary states. There are occasions when a sequential             circuit uses fewer than this maximum possible number of states. States that are not used                                      Section 6.5 Other Counters 279 in specifying the sequential circuit are not listed in the state table. In simplifying the input equations, the unused states may be treated as dont\\\\care conditions or may be assigned specific next states. It is important to realize that once the circuit is designed and constructed, outside interference during its operation may cause the circuit to enter one of the unused states. In that case, it is necessary to ensure that the circuit eventually goes into one of the valid states so that it can resume normal operation. Otherwise, if the sequential circuit circulates among unused states, there will be no way to bring it back to its intended sequence of state transitions. If the unused states are treated as dont\\\\care conditions, then once the circuit is designed, it must be investigated to determine the effect of the unused states. The next state from an unused state can be determined from the analysis of the circuit after it is designed.    As an illustration, consider the counter specified in Table 6.7. The count has a repeated sequence of six states, with flip\\\\flops B and C repeating the binary count 00, 01, 10, and flip\\\\flop A alternating between 0 and 1 every three counts. The count sequence of the counter is not straight binary, and two states, 011 and 111, are not included in the count. The choice of JK flip\\\\flops results in the flip\\\\flop input conditions listed in the table. Inputs KB and KC have only 1s and Xs in their columns, so these inputs are always equal to 1. The other flip\\\\flop input equations can be simplified by using minterms 3 and 7 as dont\\\\care conditions. The simplified equations are                          JA = B      KA = B                          JB = C      KB = 1                          JC = B      KC = 1    The logic diagram of the counter is shown in Fig. 6.16(a). Since there are two unused states, we analyze the circuit to determine their effect. If the circuit happens to be in state 011 because of an error signal, the circuit goes to state 100 after the application of a clock pulse. This action may be determined from an inspection of the logic diagram by noting that when B = 1, the next clock edge complements A and clears C to 0, and when C = 1, the next clock edge complements B. In a similar manner, we can evaluate the next state from present state 111 to be 000.

If             the circuit ever goes to one of the unused states because of outside interference, the next             count pulse transfers it to one of the valid states and the circuit continues to count cor-             rectly. Thus, the counter is self\\\\correcting. In a self\\\\correcting counter, if the counter             happens to be in one of the unused states, it eventually reaches the normal count             sequence after one or more clock pulses. An alternative design could use additional logic             to direct every unused state to a specific next state. Ring Counter             Timing signals that control the sequence of operations in a digital system can be gener-             ated by a shift register or by a counter with a decoder. A ring counter is a circular shift             register with only one flip\\\\flop being set at any particular time; all others are cleared.             The single bit is shifted from one flip\\\\flop to the next to produce the sequence of timing             signals. Figure 6.17(a) shows a four\\\\bit shift register connected as a ring counter. The             initial value of the register is 1000 and requires Preset/Clear flip\\\\flops. The single bit is                                                Section 6.5 Other Counters 281      Shift                                     T0 T1 T2 T3      right                                                (a) Ring-counter (initial value  1000) CLK T0 T1 T2 T3                       (b) Sequence of four timing signals                                 T0 T1 T2 T3                                        24                                      decoder                                         Count          2-bit counter                                        enable  (c) Counter and decoder FIGURE 6.17 Generation of timing signals shifted right with every clock pulse and circulates back from T3 to T0. Each flip\\\\flop is in the 1 state once every four clock cycles and produces one of the four timing signals shown in Fig. 6.17(b). Each output becomes a 1 after the negative\\\\edge transition of a clock pulse and remains 1 during the next clock cycle.                 For an alternative design, the timing signals can be generated by a two\\\\bit counter             that goes through four distinct states.The decoder shown in Fig. 6.17(c) decodes the four             states of the counter and generates the required sequence of timing signals.                 To generate 2n timing signals, we need either a shift register with 2n flip\\\\flops or an             n\\\\bit binary counter together with an n\\\\to\\\\2n\\\\line decoder. For example, 16 timing sig-             nals can be generated with a 16\\\\bit shift register connected as a ring counter or with a             4\\\\bit binary counter and a 4\\\\to\\\\16\\\\line decoder. In the first case, we need 16 flip\\\\flops.             In the second, we need 4 flip\\\\flops and 16 four\\\\input AND gates for the decoder. It is             also possible to generate the timing signals with a combination of a shift register and a             decoder. That way, the number of flip\\\\flops is less than that in a ring counter, and the             decoder requires only two\\\\input gates. This combination is called a Johnson counter. Johnson Counter             A k\\\\bit ring counter circulates a single bit among the flip\\\\flops to provide k distinguish-             able states. The number of states can be doubled if the shift register is connected as a             switch\\\\tail ring counter. A switch\\\\tail ring counter is a circular shift register with the             complemented output of the last flip\\\\flop connected to the input of the first flip\\\\flop.             Figure 6.18(a) shows such a shift register.

The register shifts its contents once to the right with every clock pulse, and at the same      time, the complemented value of the E flip\\\\flop is transferred into the A flip\\\\flop.      Starting from a cleared state, the switch\\\\tail ring counter goes through a sequence of      eight states, as listed in Fig. 6.18(b). In general, a k\\\\bit switch\\\\tail ring counter will go      through a sequence of 2k states. Starting from all 0s, each shift operation inserts 1s from      the left until the register is filled with all 1s. In the next sequences, 0s are inserted from      the left until the register is again filled with all 0s.         A Johnson counter is a k\\\\bit switch\\\\tail ring counter with 2k decoding gates to pro-      vide outputs for 2k timing signals. The decoding gates are not shown in Fig. 6.18, but are      specified in the last column of the table. The eight AND gates listed in the table, when      connected to the circuit, will complete the construction of the Johnson counter. Since      each gate is enabled during one particular state sequence, the outputs of the gates gen-      erate eight timing signals in succession.         The decoding of a k\\\\bit switch\\\\tail ring counter to obtain 2k timing signals follows a      regular pattern. The all\\\\0s state is decoded by taking the complement of the two extreme      flip\\\\flop outputs. The all\\\\1s state is decoded by taking the normal outputs of the two extreme      flip\\\\flops. All other states are decoded from an adjacent 1, 0 or 0, 1 pattern in the sequence.      For example, sequence 7 has an adjacent 0, 1 pattern in flip\\\\flops B and C. The decoded      output is then obtained by taking the complement of B and the normal output of C, or BC.         One disadvantage of the circuit in Fig. 6.18(a) is that if it finds itself in an unused state,      it will persist in moving from one invalid state to another and never find its way to a valid      state. The difficulty can be corrected by modifying the circuit to avoid this undesirable      condition. One correcting procedure is to disconnect the output from flip\\\\flop B that goes      to the D input of flip\\\\flop C and instead enable the input of flip\\\\flop C by the function                                                   DC = (A + C)B      where DC is the flip\\\\flop input equation for the D input of flip\\\\flop C.         Johnson counters can be constructed for any number of timing sequences. The num-      ber of flip\\\\flops needed is one\\\\half the number of timing signals. The number of decod-      ing gates is equal to the number of timing signals, and only two\\\\input gates are needed. 6.6  HDL FOR REGISTERS AND COUNTERS       Registers and counters can be described in Verilog at either the behavioral or the struc-       tural level. Behavioral modeling describes only the operations of the register, as pre-       scribed by a function table, without a preconceived structure. A structural\\\\level       description shows the circuit in terms of a collection of components such as gates, flip\\\\       flops, and multiplexers. The various components are instantiated to form a hierarchical       description of the design similar to a representation of a multilevel logic diagram. The       examples in this section will illustrate both types of descriptions. Both are useful. When       a machine is complex, a hierarchical description creates a physical partition of the       machine into simpler and more easily described units. Shift Register             The universal shift register presented in Section 6.2 is a bidirectional shift register with a             parallel load. The four clocked operations that are performed with the register are speci-             fied in Table 6.6. The register also can be cleared asynchronously. Our chosen name for a             behavioral description of the four\\\\bit universal shift register shown in Fig. 6.7(a), the name             Shift_Register_4_beh, signifies the behavioral model of the internal detail of the top\\\\level             block diagram symbol and distinguishes that model from a structural one. The behavioral             model is presented in HDL Example 6.1, and the structural model is given in HDL Exam-             ple 6.2. The top\\\\level block diagram symbol in Fig. 6.7(a) indicates that the four\\\\bit uni-             versal shift register has two selection inputs (s1, s0), two serial inputs (shift_left, shift_right),             for controlling the shift register, two serial datapath inputs (MSB_in and LSB_in), a four\\\\             bit parallel input (I_par), and a four\\\\bit parallel output (A_par). The elements of vector             I_par[3: 0] correspond to the bits I3, . . . , I0 in Fig. 6.7, and similarly for A_par[3: 0].             The always block describes the five operations that can be performed with the register.             The Clear input clears the register asynchronously with an active\\\\low signal. Clear             must be high for the register to respond to the positive edge of the clock. The four             clocked operations of the register are determined from the values of the two select             inputs in the case statement. (s1 and s0 are concatenated into a two\\\\bit vector and are used             as the expression argument of the case statement.) The shifting operation is specified by the             concatenation of the serial input and three bits of the register. For example, the statement             A_par <= {MSB_in, A_par [3: 1]} specifies a concatenation of the serial data input for a right shift operation (MSB_in) with bits A_par[3: 1] of the output data bus. A reference to a contiguous range of bits within a vector is referred to as a part select. The four\\\\bit result of the concatenation is transferred to register A_par [3: 0] when the clock pulse triggers the operation. This transfer produces a shift\\\\right operation and updates the register with new information. The shift operation overwrites the contents of A_par[0] with the contents of A_par[1]. Note that only the functionality of the circuit has been described, irrespective of any particular hardware. A synthesis tool would create a netlist of ASIC cells to implement the shift register in the structure of Fig. 6.7(b).

Consider the following alternative case statement for the shift register model: case ({s1, s0})                                // No change   // 2\\'b00: A_par <= A_par;                    // Shift right   2\\'b01: A_par <= {MSB_in, A_par [3: 1]};      // Shift left   2\\'b10: A_par <= {A_par [2: 0], LSB_in};      // Parallel load of input   2\\'b11: A_par <= I_par; endcase    Without the case item 2b00, the case statement would not find a match between 5s1, s0 6 and the case items, so register A_par would be left unchanged.    A structural model of the universal shift register can be described by referring to the logic diagram of Fig. 6.7(b).The diagram shows that the register has four multiplexers and four D flip\\\\flops. A mux and flip\\\\flop together are modeled as a stage of the shift register. The stage is a structural model, too, with an instantiation and interconnection of a module for a mux and another for a D flip\\\\flop. For simplicity, the lowest\\\\level modules of the structure are behavioral models of the multiplexer and flip\\\\flop. Attention must be paid to the details of connecting the stages correctly. The structural description of the register is shown in HDL Example 6.2. The top\\\\level module declares the inputs and outputs and then instantiates four copies of a stage of the register. The four instantiations specify the interconnections between the four stages and provide the detailed construction of the register as specified in the logic diagram. The behavioral description of the flip\\\\flop uses a single edge\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior (an always block). The assignment statements use the nonblocking assignment operator (<=) the model of the mux employs a single level\\\\ sensitive behavior, and the assignments use the blocking assignment operator (=).

A simulation should verify that             the models have the same functionality. In practice, a designer develops only the behav-             ioral model, which is then synthesized. The function of the synthesized circuit can be             compared with the behavioral description from which it was compiled. Eliminating the             need for the designer to develop a structural model produces a huge improvement in             the efficiency of the design process. Synchronous Counter             HDL Example 6.3 presents Binary_Counter_4_Par_Load, a behavioral model of the             synchronous counter with a parallel load from Fig. 6.14. Count, Load, CLK, and Clear_b             are inputs that determine the operation of the counter according to the function speci-             fied in Table 6.6. The counter has four data inputs, four data outputs, and a carry output.             The internal data lines (I3, I2, I1, I0) are bundled as Data_in[3: 0] in the behavioral             model. Likewise, the register that holds the bits of the count (A3, A2, A1, A0) is A_             count[3: 0]. It is good practice to have identifiers in the HDL model of a circuit corre-             spond exactly to those in the documentation of the model. That is not always feasible,             however, if the circuit\\\\level identifiers are those found in a handbook, for they are often             short and cryptic and do not exploit the text that is available with an HDL. The top\\\\level             block diagram symbol in Fig. 6.14(a) serves as an interface between the names used in             a circuit diagram and the expressive names that can be used in the HDL model. The             carry output C_out is generated by a combinational circuit and is specified with an assign             statement. C_out = 1when the count reaches 15 and the counter is in the count state.             Thus, C_out = 1if Count = 1, Load = 0, and A = 1111; otherwise C_out = 0. The             always block specifies the operation to be performed in the register, depending on the             values of Clear_b, Load, and Count. A 0 (active\\\\low signal) at Clear_b resets A to 0.             Otherwise, if Clear_b = 1, one out of three operations is triggered by the positive edge             of the clock. The if, else if, and else statements establish a precedence among the control             signals Clear, Load, and Count corresponding to the specification in Table 6.6. Clear_b             overrides Load and Count; Load overrides Count. A synthesis tool will produce the             circuit of Fig. 6.14(b) from the behavioral model.

The first             module instantiates four internally complementing flip\\\\flops defined in the second mod-             ule as Comp_D_flip_flop (Q, CLK, Reset). The clock (input CLK) of the first flip\\\\flop             is connected to the external control signal Count. (Count replaces CLK in the port list             of instance F0.) The clock input of the second flip\\\\flop is connected to the output of the             first. (A0 replaces CLK in instance F1.) Similarly, the clock of each of the other flip\\\\flops             is connected to the output of the previous flip\\\\flop. In this way, the flip\\\\flops are chained             together to create a ripple counter as shown in Fig. 6.8(b).                 The second module describes a complementing flip\\\\flop with delay. The circuit of a             complementing flip\\\\flop is constructed by connecting the complement output to the D             input. A reset input is included with the flip\\\\flop in order to be able to initialize the             counter; otherwise the simulator would assign the unknown value (x) to the output of             the flip\\\\flop and produce useless results. The flip\\\\flop is assigned a delay of two time             units from the time that the clock is applied to the time that the flip\\\\flop complements             its output. The delay is specified by the statement Q 6 = #2 Q. Notice that the delay             operator is placed to the right of the nonblocking assignment operator. This form of             delay, called intra\\\\assignment delay, has the effect of postponing the assignment of the             complemented value of Q to Q. The effect of modeling the delay will be apparent in             the simulation results. This style of modeling might be useful in simulation, but it is to             be avoided when the model is to be synthesized. The results of synthesis depend on the             ASIC cell library that is accessed by the tool, not on any propagation delays that might             appear within the model that is to be synthesized.

The always statement generates a free\\\\        running clock with a cycle of 10 time units. The flip\\\\flops trigger on the negative edge of        the clock, which occurs at t = 10, 20, 30, and every 10 time units thereafter.The waveforms        obtained from this simulation are shown in Fig. 6.19.The control signal Count goes negative        every 10 ns. A0 is complemented with each negative edge of Count, but is delayed by 2 ns.        Each flip\\\\flop is complemented when its previous flip\\\\flop goes from 1 to 0.After t = 80 ns,        all four flip\\\\flops complement because the counter goes from 0111 to 1000. Each output is        delayed by 2 ns, and because of that, A3 goes from 0 to 1 at t = 88 ns and from 1 to 0 at        168 ns. Notice how the propagation delays accumulate to the last bit of the counter, result-        ing in very slow counter action. This limits the practical utility of the counter.        0.0 ns   57.0 ns               114.0 ns                                    171.0 ns Reset Count A0 A1 A2 A3                                t  88 ns                                            t  168 ns                          (a) From 0 to 180 ns                                     91.0 ns        70.0 ns  77.0 ns               84.0 ns                                                 98.0 ns Reset Count A0 A1 A2 A3                                                             (b) From 70 to 98 ns            FIGURE 6.19            Simulation output of HDL Example 6.4           Problems 291 PROBLEMS (Answers to problems marked with * appear at the end of the book. Where appropriate, a logic design and its related HDL modeling problem are cross-referenced.) Note: For each problem that requires writing and verifying a Verilog description, a test plan is to be written to identify which functional features are to be tested during the simulation and how they will be tested. For example, a reset on the fly could be tested by asserting the reset signal while the simulated machine is in a state other than the reset state. The test plan is to guide the development of a test bench that will implement the plan. Simulate the model using the test bench and verify that the behavior is correct. If synthesis tools and an ASIC cell library or a field pro- grammable gate array (FPGA) tool suite are available, the Verilog descriptions developed for Problems 6.34C6.51 can be assigned as synthesis exercises. The gate\\\\level circuit produced by the synthesis tools should be simulated and compared to the simulation results for the pre\\\\synthesis model.     In some of the HDL problems, there may be a need to deal with the issue of unused states (see the discussion of the default case item preceding HDL Example 4.8 in Chapter 4). 6.1 Include a 2\\\\input NAND gate in the register of Fig. 6.1 and connect the gate output to the          C inputs of all the flip\\\\flops. One input of the NAND gate receives the clock pulses from          the clock generator, and the other input of the NAND gate provides a parallel load control.          Explain the operation of the modified register. Explain why this circuit might have opera-          tional problems. 6.2 Include a synchronous clear input to the register of Fig. 6.2.The modified register will have          a parallel load capability and a synchronous clear capability. The register is cleared syn-          chronously when the clock goes through a positive transition and the clear input is equal          to 1. (HDLsee Problem 6.35(a), (b).) 6.3 What is the difference between serial and parallel transfer? Explain how to convert serial          data to parallel and parallel data to serial. What type of register is needed? 6.4*  The contents of a four\\\\bit register is initially 0110. The register is shifted six times to the       right with the serial input being 1011100. What is the content of the register after each       shift? 6.5 The four\\\\bit universal shift register shown in Fig. 6.7 is enclosed within one IC component          package. (HDLsee Problem 6.52.)          (a) Draw a block diagram of the IC showing all inputs and outputs. Include two pins for                the power supply.          (b) Draw a block diagram using two of these ICs to produce an eight\\\\bit universal shift                register. 6.6 Design a four\\\\bit shift register with parallel load using D flip\\\\flops. There are two control          inputs: shift and load. When shift = 1, the content of the register is shifted by one posi-          tion. New data are transferred into the register when load = 1 and shift = 0. If both          control inputs are equal to 0, the content of the register does not change.

Register A holds the binary number       0101 and register B holds 0111. The carry flip\\\\flop is initially reset to 0. List the binary       values in register A and the carry flip\\\\flop after each shift. (HDLsee Problem 6.54). 6.9 Two ways for implementing a serial adder (A + B) is shown in Section 6.2. It is necessary          to modify the circuits to convert them to serial subtractors (A - B).          (a) Using the circuit of Fig. 6.5, show the changes needed to perform A + 2s complement                of B. (HDLsee Problem 6.35(h).)          (b) *Using the circuit of Fig. 6.6, show the changes needed by modifying Table 6.2 from an                adder to a subtractor circuit. (See Problem 4.12). (HDLsee Problem 6.35(i).) 6.10  Design a serial 2s complementer with a shift register and a flip\\\\flop. The binary number       is shifted out from one side and its 2s complement shifted into the other side of the shift       register. (HDLsee Problem 6.35(j).) 6.11  A binary ripple counter uses flip\\\\flops that trigger on the positive\\\\edge of the clock. What       will be the count if       (a) the normal outputs of the flip\\\\flops are connected to the clock and       (b) the complement outputs of the flip\\\\flops are connected to the clock? 6.12  Draw the logic diagram of a four\\\\bit binary ripple countdown counter using       (a) flip\\\\flops that trigger on the positive\\\\edge of the clock and       (b) flip\\\\flops that trigger on the negative\\\\edge of the clock. 6.13  Show that a BCD ripple counter can be constructed using a four\\\\bit binary ripple counter       with asynchronous clear and a NAND gate that detects the occurrence of count 1010.       (HDLsee Problem 6.35(k).) 6.14  How many flip\\\\flop will be complemented in a 10\\\\bit binary ripple counter to reach the       next count after the following counts?       (a) *1001100111       (b) 1111000111       (c) 0000001111 6.15* A flip\\\\flops has a 3 ns delay from the time the clock edge occurs to the time the output          is complemented. What is the maximum delay in a 10\\\\bit binary ripple counter that uses          these flip\\\\flops? What is the maximum frequency at which the counter can operate          reliably? 6.16* The BCD ripple counter shown in Fig. 6.10 has four flip\\\\flops and 16 states, of which only          10 are used. Analyze the circuit and determine the next state for each of the other six          unused states. What will happen if a noise signal sends the circuit to one of the unused          states? (HDLsee Problem 6.54.)                                                                          Problems 293 6.17* Design a four\\\\bit binary synchronous counter with D flip\\\\flops. 6.18  What operation is performed in the upCdown counter of Fig. 6.13 when both the up and       down inputs are enabled? Modify the circuit so that when both inputs are equal to 1, the       counter does not change state. (HDLsee Problem 6.35(l).) 6.19  The flip\\\\flop input equations for a BCD counter using T flip\\\\flops are given in Section 6.4.       Obtain the input equations for a BCD counter that uses (a) JK flip\\\\flops and (b)* D flip\\\\       flops. Compare the three designs to determine which one is the most efficient. 6.20  Enclose the binary counter with parallel load of Fig. 6.14 in a block diagram showing, all       inputs and outputs.       (a) Show the connections of four such blocks to produce a 16\\\\bit counter with parallel             load.       (b) Construct a binary counter that counts from 0 through binary 127. 6.21* The counter of Fig. 6.14 has two control inputsLoad (L) and Count (C)and a data          input, (Ii).

Load (L)                                                                                                                   J Count (C)         CLK                                    K   Data (I)     FIGURE P6.21 6.22  For the circuit of Fig. 6.14, give three alternatives for a mod\\\\10 counter (i.e., the count       evolves through a sequence of 12 distinct states).       (a) Using an AND gate and the load input.       (b) Using the output carry.       (c) Using a NAND gate and the asynchronous clear input. 6.23  Design a timing circuit that provides an output signal that stays on for exactly twelve clock       cycles. A start signal sends the output to the 1 state, and after twelve clock cycles the signal       returns to the 0 state. (HDLsee Problem 6.45.) 6.24* Design a counter with T flip\\\\flops that goes through the following binary repeated se-          quence: 0, 1, 3, 7, 6, 4. Show that when binary states 010 and 101 are considered as dont          care conditions, the counter may not operate properly. Find a way to correct the design.          (HDLsee Problem 6.55.) 6.25  It is necessary to generate six repeated timing signals T0 through T5 similar to the ones       shown in Fig. 6.17(c). Design the circuit using (HDLsee Problem 6.46.):       (a) flip\\\\flops only.       (b) a counter and a decoder. 6.26* A digital system has a clock generator that produces pulses at a frequency of 80 MHz.          Design a circuit that provides a clock with a cycle time of 50 ns. 6.27  Using JK flip\\\\flops,       (a) Design a counter with the following repeated binary sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.             (HDLsee Problem 6.50(a), 6.51.).       (b) Draw the logic diagram of the counter. 6.28  Using D flip\\\\flops,       (a) *Design a counter with the following repeated binary sequence: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6.

Determine the       next state for each of these states and show that, if the counter finds itself in an invalid       state, it does not return to a valid state. Modify the circuit as recommended in the text and       show that the counter produces the same sequence of states and that the circuit reaches a       valid state from any one of the unused states. 6.30  Show that a Johnson counter with n flip\\\\flops produces a sequence of 2n states. List the       10 states produced with five flip\\\\flops and the Boolean terms of each of the 10 AND gate       outputs. 6.31 Write and verify the HDL behavioral and structural descriptions of the four\\\\bit register          Fig. 6.1. 6.32 (a) Write and verify an HDL behavioral description of a four\\\\bit register with parallel                load and asynchronous clear.

The order of precedence is: Load, Up, and Down.       (b) The counter has two selection inputs to specify four operations: Load, Up, Down, and             no change. 6.39 Write and verify HDL behavioral and structural descriptions of the counter of Fig. 6.16. 6.40 Write and verify the HDL description of an eight\\\\bit ring\\\\counter similar to the one shown          in Fig. 6.17(a). 6.41 Write and verify the HDL description of a four\\\\bit switch\\\\tail ring (Johnson) counter          (Fig. 6.18a). 6.42* The comment with the last clause of the if statement in Binary_Counter_4_Par_Load in          HDL Example 6.3 notes that the statement is redundant. Explain why this statement can          be removed without changing the behavior implemented by the description. 6.43  The scheme shown in Fig. 6.4 gates the clock to control the serial transfer of data from shift       register A to shift register B. Using multiplexers at the input of each cell of the shift registers,       develop a structural model of an alternative circuit that does not alter the clock path. The       top level of the design hierarchy is to instantiate the shift registers. The module describing       the shift registers is to have instantiations of flip\\\\flops and muxes. Describe the mux and       flip\\\\flop modules with behavioral models. Be sure to consider the need to reset the machine.       Develop a test bench to simulate the circuit and demonstrate the transfer of data. 6.44  Modify the design of the serial adder shown in Fig. 6.5 by removing the gated clock to the D       flip\\\\flop and supplying the clock signal to it directly. Augment the D flip\\\\flop with a mux to       recirculate the contents of the flip\\\\flop when shifting is suspended and provide the carry out       of the full adder when shifting is active. The shift registers are to incorporate this feature also,       rather than use a gated clock. The top\\\\level of the design is to instantiate modules using       behavioral models for the shift registers, full adder, D flip\\\\flop, and mux. Assume asynchro-       nous reset. Develop a test bench to simulate the circuit and demonstrate the transfer of data. 6.45* Write and verify a behavioral description of a finite state machine to implement the coun-          ter described in Problem 6.24. 6.46  Problem 6.25 specifies an implementation of a circuit to generate timing signals using       (a) Only flip\\\\flops.       (b) A counter and a decoder.       As an alternative, write a behavioral description (without consideration of the actual hard-       ware) of a state machine whose output generates the timing signals T0 through T5. 6.47 Write a behavioral description of the circuit shown in Fig. P6.47 and verify that the circuits          output is asserted if successive samples of the input have an odd number of 1s.

When data processing takes       place, information from memory is transferred to selected registers in the processing unit.       Intermediate and final results obtained in the processing unit are transferred back to be       stored in memory. Binary information received from an input device is stored in memory,       and information transferred to an output device is taken from memory. A memory unit       is a collection of cells capable of storing a large quantity of binary information.          There are two types of memories that are used in digital systems: random\\\\access       memory (RAM) and read\\\\only memory (ROM). RAM stores new information for later       use. The process of storing new information into memory is referred to as a memory       write operation. The process of transferring the stored information out of memory is       referred to as a memory read operation. RAM can perform both write and read opera-       tions. ROM can perform only the read operation. This means that suitable binary infor-       mation is already stored inside memory and can be retrieved or read at any time.       However, that information cannot be altered by writing.          ROM is a programmable logic device (PLD). The binary information that is stored       within such a device is specified in some fashion and then embedded within the hard-       ware in a process is referred to as programming the device. The word programming       here refers to a hardware procedure which specifies the bits that are inserted into the       hardware configuration of the device.          ROM is one example of a PLD. Other such units are the programmable logic array       (PLA), programmable array logic (PAL), and the field\\\\programmable gate array (FPGA).       A PLD is an integrated circuit with internal logic gates connected through electronic                                299      (a) Conventional symbol                            (b) Array logic symbol      FIGURE 7.1      Conventional and array logic diagrams for OR gate      paths that behave similarly to fuses. In the original state of the device, all the fuses are      intact. Programming the device involves blowing those fuses along the paths that must      be removed in order to obtain the particular configuration of the desired logic function.      In this chapter, we introduce the configuration of PLDs and indicate procedures for their      use in the design of digital systems. We also present CMOS FPGAs, which are configured      by downloading a stream of bits into the device to configure transmission gates to estab-      lish the internal connectivity required by a specified logic function (combinational or      sequential).         A typical PLD may have hundreds to millions of gates interconnected through hun-      dreds to thousands of internal paths. In order to show the internal logic diagram of such      a device in a concise form, it is necessary to employ a special gate symbology applicable      to array logic. Figure 7.1 shows the conventional and array logic symbols for a multiple\\\\      input OR gate. Instead of having multiple input lines into the gate, we draw a single line      entering the gate. The input lines are drawn perpendicular to this single line and are      connected to the gate through internal fuses. In a similar fashion, we can draw the array      logic for an AND gate. This type of graphical representation for the inputs of gates will      be used throughout the chapter in array logic diagrams. 7.2  RANDOM-ACCESS MEMORY       A memory unit is a collection of storage cells, together with associated circuits needed       to transfer information into and out of a device. The architecture of memory is such that       information can be selectively retrieved from any of its internal locations. The time it       takes to transfer information to or from any desired random location is always the       samehence the name random\\\\access memory, abbreviated RAM. In contrast, the time       required to retrieve information that is stored on magnetic tape depends on the location       of the data.          A memory unit stores binary information in groups of bits called words. A word in       memory is an entity of bits that move in and out of storage as a unit. A memory word       is a group of 1s and 0s and may represent a number, an instruction, one or more       alphanumeric characters, or any other binary\\\\coded information. A group of 8 bits is       called a byte. Most computer memories use words that are multiples of 8 bits in length.       Thus, a 16\\\\bit word contains two bytes, and a 32\\\\bit word is made up of four bytes. The       capacity of a memory unit is usually stated as the total number of bytes that the unit       can store.

A block diagram of a memory unit is shown in Fig. 7.2. The n data input lines provide the information to be stored in memory, and the n data output lines supply the information coming out of memory. The k address lines specify the particular word chosen among the many available. The two control inputs specify the direction of trans- fer desired: The Write input causes binary data to be transferred into the memory, and the Read input causes binary data to be transferred out of memory.    The memory unit is specified by the number of words it contains and the number of bits in each word. The address lines select one particular word. Each word in memory is assigned an identification number, called an address, starting from 0 up to 2k - 1, where k is the number of address lines. The selection of a specific word inside memory is done by applying the k\\\\bit address to the address lines. An internal decoder accepts this address and opens the paths needed to select the word specified. Memories vary greatly in size and may range from 1,024 words, requiring an address of 10 bits, to 232 words, requiring 32 address bits. It is customary to refer to the number of words (or bytes) in memory with one of the letters K (kilo), M (mega), and G (giga). K is equal to 210, M is equal to 220, and G is equal to 230. Thus, 64K = 216, 2M = 221, and 4G = 232.    Consider, for example, a memory unit with a capacity of 1K words of 16 bits each. Since 1K = 1,024 = 210 and 16 bits constitute two bytes, we can say that the memory can accommodate 2,048 = 2K bytes . Figure 7.3 shows possible contents of the first three and the last three words of this memory. Each word contains 16 bits that can be divided into two bytes. The words are recognized by their decimal address from 0 to 1,023. The equivalent binary address consists of 10 bits. The first address is specified with ten 0s; the last address is specified with ten 1s, because 1,023 in binary is equal to 1111111111. A word in memory is selected by its binary address. When a word is read or written, the memory operates on all 16 bits as a single unit.    The 1K * 16 memory of Fig. 7.3 has 10 bits in the address and 16 bits in each word. As another example, a 64K * 10 memory will have 16 bits in the address (since 64K = 216) and each word will consist of 10 bits.

The number of bits in the address             is determined from the relationship 2k  m, where m is the total number of words and             k is the number of address bits needed to satisfy the relationship. Write and Read Operations             The two operations that RAM can perform are the write and read operations. As alluded             to earlier, the write signal specifies a transfer\\\\in operation and the read signal specifies             a transfer\\\\out operation. On accepting one of these control signals, the internal circuits             inside the memory provide the desired operation.                 The steps that must be taken for the purpose of transferring a new word to be stored             into memory are as follows:                 1. Apply the binary address of the desired word to the address lines.                 2. Apply the data bits that must be stored in memory to the data input lines.                 3. Activate the write input.             The memory unit will then take the bits from the input data lines and store them in the             word specified by the address lines.                 The steps that must be taken for the purpose of transferring a stored word out of             memory are as follows:                 1. Apply the binary address of the desired word to the address lines.                 2. Activate the read input.                Section 7.2 Random-Access Memory 303 Table 7.1 Control Inputs to Memory Chip Memory Enable  Read/Write         Memory Operation                                   None 0                              X  Write to selected word                                   Read from selected word 1                              0 1                              1             The memory unit will then take the bits from the word that has been selected by the             address and apply them to the output data lines. The contents of the selected word do             not change after the read operation, i.e., the word operation is nondestructive.                 Commercial memory components available in integrated\\\\circuit chips sometimes             provide the two control inputs for reading and writing in a somewhat different configu-             ration. Instead of having separate read and write inputs to control the two operations,             most integrated circuits provide two other control inputs: One input selects the unit and             the other determines the operation. The memory operations that result from these             control inputs are specified in Table 7.1.                 The memory enable (sometimes called the chip select) is used to enable the particu-             lar memory chip in a multichip implementation of a large memory. When the memory             enable is inactive, the memory chip is not selected and no operation is performed. When             the memory enable input is active, the read/write input determines the operation to be             performed. Memory Description in HDL             Memory is modeled in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL) by an array             of registers. It is declared with a reg keyword, using a two\\\\dimensional array. The first             number in the array specifies the number of bits in a word (the word length) and the             second gives the number of words in memory (memory depth). For example, a memory             of 1,024 words with 16 bits per word is declared as                                                         reg[15: 0] memword [0: 1023];             This statement describes a two\\\\dimensional array of 1,024 registers, each containing 16             bits. The second array range in the declaration of memword specifies the total number             of words in memory and is equivalent to the address of the memory. For example,             memword[512] refers to the 16\\\\bit memory word at address 512.                 The operation of a memory unit is illustrated in HDL Example 7.1. The memory has             64 words of four bits each. There are two control inputs: Enable and ReadWrite. The             DataIn and DataOut lines have four bits each. The input Address must have six bits             (since 26 = 64). The memory is declared as a two\\\\dimensional array of registers, with             Mem used as an identifier that can be referenced with an index to access any of the             64 words. A memory operation requires that the Enable input be active. The ReadWrite             input determines the type of operation. If ReadWrite is 1, the memory performs a read             operation symbolized by the statement                                             DataOut d Mem [Address]; Execution of this statement causes a transfer of four bits from the selected memory word specified by Address onto the DataOut lines. If ReadWrite is 0, the memory performs a write operation symbolized by the statement                                              Mem [Address] d DataIn; Execution of this statement causes a transfer from the four\\\\bit DataIn lines into the memory word selected by Address. When Enable is equal to 0, the memory is disabled and the outputs are assumed to be in a high\\\\impedance state, indicated by the symbol z. Thus, the memory has three\\\\state outputs.

The CPU is usually synchronized by its own clock. The memory,             however, does not employ an internal clock. Instead, its read and write operations are             specified by control inputs. The access time of memory is the time required to select a             word and read it. The cycle time of memory is the time required to complete a write             operation. The CPU must provide the memory control signals in such a way as to syn-             chronize its internal clocked operations with the read and write operations of memory.             This means that the access time and cycle time of the memory must be within a time             equal to a fixed number of CPU clock cycles.                 Suppose as an example that a CPU operates with a clock frequency of 50 MHz, giv-             ing a period of 20 ns for one clock cycle. Suppose also that the CPU communicates with             a memory whose access time and cycle time do not exceed 50 ns. This means that the                                Section 7.2 Random-Access Memory 305 Clock     20 nsec                               T2               T3              T1          T1 Memory address                                         Address valid Memory                        Initiate writing                   Latched enable                                                   Data valid Read/                                           (a) Write cycle Write Data input                                                 50 nsec                           T1                    T2               T3              T1 Clock                                                 Address valid Memory address Memory                        Initiate read enable Read/ Write        Data                                                          Data valid        output                                                 (b) Read cycle FIGURE 7.4 Memory cycle timing waveforms write cycle terminates the storage of the selected word within a 50\\\\ns interval and that the read cycle provides the output data of the selected word within 50 ns or less. (The two numbers are not always the same.) Since the period of the CPU cycle is 20 ns, it will be necessary to devote at least two\\\\and\\\\a\\\\half, and possibly three, clock cycles for each memory request.    The memory timing shown in Fig. 7.4 is for a CPU with a 50\\\\MHz clock and a memory with 50 ns maximum cycle time. The write cycle in part (a) shows three 20\\\\ns cycles: T 1,             T 2, and T 3. For a write operation, the CPU must provide the address and input data to             the memory. This is done at the beginning of T 1. (The two lines that cross each other in             the address and data waveforms designate a possible change in value of the multiple             lines.) The memory enable and the read/write signals must be activated after the signals             in the address lines are stable in order to avoid destroying data in other memory words.             The memory enable signal switches to the high level and the read/write signal switches             to the low level to indicate a write operation. The two control signals must stay active             for at least 50 ns. The address and data signals must remain stable for a short time after             the control signals are deactivated. At the completion of the third clock cycle, the mem-             ory write operation is completed and the CPU can access the memory again with the             next T 1 cycle.                 The read cycle shown in Fig. 7.4(b) has an address for the memory provided by the             CPU. The memory\\\\enable and read/write signals must be in their high level for a read             operation. The memory places the data of the word selected by the address into the out-             put data lines within a 50\\\\ns interval (or less) from the time that the memory enable is             activated. The CPU can transfer the data into one of its internal registers during the             negative transition of T3. The next T1 cycle is available for another memory request. Types of Memories             The mode of access of a memory system is determined by the type of components used.             In a random\\\\access memory, the word locations may be thought of as being separated             in space, each word occupying one particular location. In a sequential\\\\access memory,             the information stored in some medium is not immediately accessible, but is available             only at certain intervals of time. A magnetic disk or tape unit is of this type. Each             memory location passes the read and write heads in turn, but information is read out             only when the requested word has been reached. In a random\\\\access memory, the access             time is always the same regardless of the particular location of the word. In a sequential\\\\             access memory, the time it takes to access a word depends on the position of the word             with respect to the position of the read head; therefore, the access time is variable.                 Integrated circuit RAM units are available in two operating modes: static and             dynamic. Static RAM (SRAM) consists essentially of internal latches that store the             binary information. The stored information remains valid as long as power is applied to             the unit. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) stores the binary information in the form of electric             charges on capacitors provided inside the chip by MOS transistors. The stored charge             on the capacitors tends to discharge with time, and the capacitors must be periodically             recharged by refreshing the dynamic memory. Refreshing is done by cycling through the             words every few milliseconds to restore the decaying charge. DRAM offers reduced             power consumption and larger storage capacity in a single memory chip. SRAM is             easier to use and has shorter read and write cycles.                 Memory units that lose stored information when power is turned off are said to be             volatile. CMOS integrated circuit RAMs, both static and dynamic, are of this category, since             the binary cells need external power to maintain the stored information. In contrast, a             nonvolatile memory, such as magnetic disk, retains its stored information after the removal                                                                Section 7.3 Memory Decoding 307        of power. This type of memory is able to retain information because the data stored on        magnetic components are represented by the direction of magnetization, which is retained        after power is turned off. ROM is another nonvolatile memory. A nonvolatile memory        enables digital computers to store programs that will be needed again after the computer        is turned on. Programs and data that cannot be altered are stored in ROM, while other        large programs are maintained on magnetic disks. The latter programs are transferred into        the computer RAM as needed. Before the power is turned off, the binary information from        the computer RAM is transferred to the disk so that the information will be retained. 7.3 MEMORY DECODING             In addition to requiring storage components in a memory unit, there is a need for decod-             ing circuits to select the memory word specified by the input address. In this section, we             present the internal construction of a RAM and demonstrate the operation of the             decoder. To be able to include the entire memory in one diagram, the memory unit             presented here has a small capacity of 16 bits, arranged in four words of 4 bits each. An             example of a two\\\\dimensional coincident decoding arrangement is presented to show a             more efficient decoding scheme that is used in large memories. We then give an example             of address multiplexing commonly used in DRAM integrated circuits. Internal Construction             The internal construction of a RAM of m words and n bits per word consists of m * n             binary storage cells and associated decoding circuits for selecting individual words. The             binary storage cell is the basic building block of a memory unit. The equivalent logic of             a binary cell that stores one bit of information is shown in Fig. 7.5. The storage part of             the cell is modeled by an SR latch with associated gates to form a D latch. Actually, the                     Select                                                                  Select Input               S                              Output Input  BC      Output                     R                                        Read/Write                   Read/Write                                                                  (b) Block diagram                     (a) Logic diagram        FIGURE 7.5        Memory cell             cell is an electronic circuit with four to six transistors. Nevertheless, it is possible and             convenient to model it in terms of logic symbols. A binary storage cell must be very small             in order to be able to pack as many cells as possible in the small area available in the             integrated circuit chip. The binary cell stores one bit in its internal latch. The select input             enables the cell for reading or writing, and the read/write input determines the operation             of the cell when it is selected. A 1 in the read/write input provides the read operation by             forming a path from the latch to the output terminal. A 0 in the read/write input provides             the write operation by forming a path from the input terminal to the latch.                 The logical construction of a small RAM is shown in Fig. 7.6. This RAM consists of             four words of four bits each and has a total of 16 binary cells. The small blocks labeled             BC represent the binary cell with its three inputs and one output, as specified in             Fig. 7.5(b). A memory with four words needs two address lines. The two address inputs             go through a 2 * 4 decoder to select one of the four words.The decoder is enabled with                                         Input data                 Word 0                                     BC  BC          BC           BC Address         Word 1 inputs                  24                 BC  BC          BC           BC                 decoder                 Word 2                                     BC  BC          BC           BC Memory      EN enable                 Word 3                                     BC  BC          BC           BC Read/Write                                                     Output data             FIGURE 7.6             Diagram of a 4 * 4 RAM                                                                     Section 7.3 Memory Decoding 309             the memory\\\\enable input. When the memory enable is 0, all outputs of the decoder are             0 and none of the memory words are selected. With the memory select at 1, one of the             four words is selected, dictated by the value in the two address lines. Once a word has             been selected, the read/write input determines the operation. During the read opera-             tion, the four bits of the selected word go through OR gates to the output terminals.             (Note that the OR gates are drawn according to the array logic established in Fig. 7.1.)             During the write operation, the data available in the input lines are transferred into the             four binary cells of the selected word. The binary cells that are not selected are disabled,             and their previous binary values remain unchanged. When the memory select input that             goes into the decoder is equal to 0, none of the words are selected and the contents of             all cells remain unchanged regardless of the value of the read/write input.                 Commercial RAMs may have a capacity of thousands of words, and each word may             range from 1 to 64 bits. The logical construction of a large\\\\capacity memory would be a             direct extension of the configuration shown here. A memory with 2k words of n bits per             word requires k address lines that go into a k * 2k decoder. Each one of the decoder             outputs selects one word of n bits for reading or writing. Coincident Decoding             A decoder with k inputs and 2k outputs requires 2k AND gates with k inputs per gate.             The total number of gates and the number of inputs per gate can be reduced by             employing two decoders in a two\\\\dimensional selection scheme. The basic idea in             two\\\\dimensional decoding is to arrange the memory cells in an array that is close as             possible to square. In this configuration, two k/2\\\\input decoders are used instead of             one k\\\\input decoder. One decoder performs the row selection and the other the col-             umn selection in a two\\\\dimensional matrix configuration.                 The two\\\\dimensional selection pattern is demonstrated in Fig. 7.7 for a 1K\\\\word             memory. Instead of using a single 10 * 1,024 decoder, we use two 5 * 32 decoders.             With the single decoder, we would need 1,024 AND gates with 10 inputs in each. In the             two\\\\decoder case, we need 64 AND gates with 5 inputs in each. The five most significant             bits of the address go to input X and the five least significant bits go to input Y. Each             word within the memory array is selected by the coincidence of one X line and one Y             line. Thus, each word in memory is selected by the coincidence between 1 of 32 rows and             1 of 32 columns, for a total of 1,024 words. Note that each intersection represents a word             that may have any number of bits.                 As an example, consider the word whose address is 404. The 10\\\\bit binary equivalent             of 404 is 01100 10100. This makes X = 01100 (binary 12) and Y = 10100 (binary 20).             The n\\\\bit word that is selected lies in the X decoder output number 12 and the Y decoder             output number 20. All the bits of the word are selected for reading or writing. Address Multiplexing             The SRAM memory cell modeled in Fig. 7.5 typically contains six transistors. In order to             build memories with higher density, it is necessary to reduce the number of transistors in             a cell. The DRAM cell contains a single MOS transistor and a capacitor. The charge stored                                                                                          Y                             5  32 decoder                 0 1 2 . . . . 20 . . . 31             0             1             2             .                                                                               binary address             .                                                                               01100 10100 X  5  32    .    decoder  12                                                                              X  Y             .             .             .             31 FIGURE 7.7 Two\\\\dimensional decoding structure for a 1K\\\\word memory on the capacitor discharges with time, and the memory cells must be periodically recharged by refreshing the memory. Because of their simple cell structure, DRAMs typically have four times the density of SRAMs. This allows four times as much memory capacity to be placed on a given size of chip. The cost per bit of DRAM storage is three to four times less than that of SRAM storage. A further cost savings is realized because of the lower power requirement of DRAM cells. These advantages make DRAM the preferred tech- nology for large memories in personal digital computers. DRAM chips are available in capacities from 64K to 256M bits. Most DRAMs have a 1\\\\bit word size, so several chips have to be combined to produce a larger word size.    Because of their large capacity, the address decoding of DRAMs is arranged in a two\\\\dimensional array, and larger memories often have multiple arrays. To reduce the number of pins in the IC package, designers utilize address multiplexing whereby one set of address input pins accommodates the address components. In a two\\\\dimensional array, the address is applied in two parts at different times, with the row address first and the column address second. Since the same set of pins is used for both parts of the address, the size of the package is decreased significantly.    We will use a 64K\\\\word memory to illustrate the address\\\\multiplexing idea. A diagram of the decoding configuration is shown in Fig. 7.8. The memory consists of                                      Section 7.3 Memory Decoding 311 CAS                                  8-bit column                                         register                                      8  256                                      decoder RAS  8-bit    8-bit    8  256            256  256      Read/Write address    row     decoder            memory          register                    cell array                                      Data  Data                                        in   out FIGURE 7.8 Address multiplexing for a 64K DRAM a two\\\\dimensional array of cells arranged into 256 rows by 256 columns, for a total of 28 * 28 = 216 = 64K words. There is a single data input line, a single data output line, and a read/write control, as well as an eight\\\\bit address input and two address strobes, the latter included for enabling the row and column address into their respective regis- ters. The row address strobe (RAS) enables the eight\\\\bit row register, and the column address strobe (CAS) enables the eight\\\\bit column register. The bar on top of the name of the strobe symbol indicates that the registers are enabled on the zero level of the signal.    The 16\\\\bit address is applied to the DRAM in two steps using RAS and CAS. Initially, both strobes are in the 1 state. The 8\\\\bit row address is applied to the address inputs and RAS is changed to 0. This loads the row address into the row address register. RAS also enables the row decoder so that it can decode the row address and select one row of the array. After a time equivalent to the settling time of the row selection, RAS goes back to the 1 level. The 8\\\\bit column address is then applied to the address inputs, and CAS is driven to the 0 state. This transfers the column address into the column register and             enables the column decoder. Now the two parts of the address are in their respective             registers, the decoders have decoded them to select the one cell corresponding to the             row and column address, and a read or write operation can be performed on that cell.             CAS must go back to the 1 level before initiating another memory operation. 7.4  ERROR DETECTION AND CORRECTION       The dynamic physical interaction of the electrical signals affecting the data path of a       memory unit may cause occasional errors in storing and retrieving the binary informa-       tion. The reliability of a memory unit may be improved by employing error\\\\detecting       and error\\\\correcting codes. The most common error detection scheme is the parity bit.       (See Section 3.9.) A parity bit is generated and stored along with the data word in       memory. The parity of the word is checked after reading it from memory. The data word       is accepted if the parity of the bits read out is correct. If the parity checked results in an       inversion, an error is detected, but it cannot be corrected.          An error\\\\correcting code generates multiple parity check bits that are stored with       the data word in memory. Each check bit is a parity over a group of bits in the data       word. When the word is read back from memory, the associated parity bits are also       read from memory and compared with a new set of check bits generated from the data       that have been read. If the check bits are correct, no error has occurred. If the check       bits do not match the stored parity, they generate a unique pattern, called a syndrome,       that can be used to identify the bit that is in error. A single error occurs when a bit       changes in value from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1 during the write or read operation. If the       specific bit in error is identified, then the error can be corrected by complementing       the erroneous bit. Hamming Code             One of the most common error\\\\correcting codes used in RAMs was devised by R. W.             Hamming. In the Hamming code, k parity bits are added to an n\\\\bit data word, forming             a new word of n + k bits. The bit positions are numbered in sequence from 1 to n + k.             Those positions numbered as a power of 2 are reserved for the parity bits. The remain-             ing bits are the data bits. The code can be used with words of any length. Before giving             the general characteristics of the code, we will illustrate its operation with a data word             of eight bits.                 Consider, for example, the 8\\\\bit data word 11000100. We include 4 parity bits with             the 8\\\\bit word and arrange the 12 bits as follows:      Bit position:  1  2 3  4 567  8 9 10 11 12                     P1 P2 1 P4 1 0 0 P8 0  1  0  0                Section 7.4 Error Detection and Correction 313 The 4 parity bits, P1, P2, P4, and P8, are in positions 1, 2, 4, and 8, respectively. The 8 bits of the data word are in the remaining positions. Each parity bit is calculated as follows:                   P1 = XOR of bits (3, 5, 7, 9, 11) = 1 { 1 { 0 { 0 { 0 = 0                   P2 = XOR of bits (3, 5, 7, 10, 11) = 1 { 0 { 0 { 1 { 0 = 0                   P4 = XOR of bits (5, 6, 7, 12) = 1 { 0 { 0 { 0 = 1                   P8 = XOR of bits (9, 10, 11, 12) = 0 { 1 { 0 { 0 = 1 Remember that the exclusive\\\\OR operation performs the odd function: It is equal to 1 for an odd number of 1s in the variables and to 0 for an even number of 1s. Thus, each parity bit is set so that the total number of 1s in the checked positions, including the parity bit, is always even.    The 8\\\\bit data word is stored in memory together with the 4 parity bits as a 12\\\\bit composite word. Substituting the 4 P bits in their proper positions, we obtain the 12\\\\bit composite word stored in memory:                0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0  1  0  0 Bit position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 When the 12 bits are read from memory, they are checked again for errors. The parity is checked over the same combination of bits, including the parity bit. The 4 check bits are evaluated as follows:                                 C1 = XOR of bits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)                                 C2 = XOR of bits (2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11)                                 C4 = XOR of bits (4, 5, 6, 7, 12)                                 C8 = XOR of bits (8, 9, 10, 11, 12) A 0 check bit designates even parity over the checked bits and a 1 designates odd parity. Since the bits were stored with even parity, the result, C = C8C4C2C1 = 0000, indicates that no error has occurred. However, if C  0, then the 4\\\\bit binary number formed by the check bits gives the position of the erroneous bit. For example, consider the following three cases: Bit position:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12                0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 No error                1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 Error in bit 1                0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 Error in bit 5 In the first case, there is no error in the 12\\\\bit word. In the second case, there is an error in bit position number 1 because it changed from 0 to 1. The third case shows an error in bit position 5, with a change from 1 to 0. Evaluating the XOR of the corre- sponding bits, we determine the 4 check bits to be as follows:                       C8             C4      C2             C1 For no error:         0              0       0              0 With error in bit 1:  0              0       0              1 With error in bit 5:  0              1       0              1 Thus, for no error, we have C = 0000; with an error in bit 1, we obtain C = 0001; and with an error in bit 5, we get C = 0101. When the binary number C is not equal to 0000, it gives the position of the bit in error. The error can be corrected by complementing the corre- sponding bit. Note that an error can occur in the data word or in one of the parity bits.    The Hamming code can be used for data words of any length. In general, the Ham- ming code consists of k check bits and n data bits, for a total of n + k bits.The syndrome value C consists of k bits and has a range of 2k values between 0 and 2k - 1. One of these values, usually zero, is used to indicate that no error was detected, leaving 2k - 1 values to indicate which of the n + k bits was in error. Each of these 2k - 1 values can be used to uniquely describe a bit in error. Therefore, the range of k must be equal to or greater than n + k, giving the relationship                                              2k - 1  n + k Solving for n in terms of k, we obtain                                              2k - 1 - k  n This relationship gives a formula for establishing the number of data bits that can be used in conjunction with k check bits. For example, when k = 3, the number of data bits that can be used is n  (23 - 1 - 3) = 4. For k = 4, we have 24 - 1 - 4 = 11, giving n  11. The data word may be less than 11 bits, but must have at least 5 bits; otherwise, only 3 check bits will be needed. This justifies the use of 4 check bits for the 8 data bits in the previous example. Ranges of n for various values of k are listed in Table 7.2.    The grouping of bits for parity generation and checking can be determined from a list of the binary numbers from 0 through 2k - 1. The least significant bit is a 1 in the binary numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. The second significant bit is a 1 in the binary numbers Table 7.2                            Range of Data Bits, n Range of Data Bits for k Check Bits                                                   2C4    Number of Check Bits, k                        5C11                                                  12C26                      3                           27C57                      4                          58C120                      5                      6                      7                                                                    Section 7.5 Read\\\\Only Memory 315             2, 3, 6, 7, and so on. Comparing these numbers with the bit positions used in generating             and checking parity bits in the Hamming code, we note the relationship between the bit             groupings in the code and the position of the 1\\\\bits in the binary count sequence. Note             that each group of bits starts with a number that is a power of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. These             numbers are also the position numbers for the parity bits. Single\\\\Error Correction, Double\\\\Error Detection             The Hamming code can detect and correct only a single error. By adding another parity             bit to the coded word, the Hamming code can be used to correct a single error and detect             double errors. If we include this additional parity bit, then the previous 12\\\\bit coded             word becomes 001110010100P13, where P13 is evaluated from the exclusive\\\\OR of the             other 12 bits. This produces the 13\\\\bit word 0011100101001 (even parity). When the             13\\\\bit word is read from memory, the check bits are evaluated, as is the parity P over             the entire 13 bits. If P = 0, the parity is correct (even parity), but if P = 1, then the             parity over the 13 bits is incorrect (odd parity). The following four cases can arise:                     If C = 0 and P = 0, no error occurred.                     If C  0 and P = 1, a single error occurred that can be corrected.                     If C  0 and P = 0, a double error occurred that is detected, but that cannot be                    corrected.                    If C = 0 and P = 1, an error occurred in the P13 bit.             This scheme may detect more than two errors, but is not guaranteed to detect all such             errors.                 Integrated circuits use a modified Hamming code to generate and check parity bits             for single\\\\error correction and double\\\\error detection. The modified Hamming code             uses a more efficient parity configuration that balances the number of bits used to cal-             culate the XOR operation. A typical integrated circuit that uses an 8\\\\bit data word and             a 5\\\\bit check word is IC type 74637. Other integrated circuits are available for data words             of 16 and 32 bits. These circuits can be used in conjunction with a memory unit to correct             a single error or detect double errors during write and read operations. 7.5  READ\\\\ONLY MEMORY       A read\\\\only memory (ROM) is essentially a memory device in which permanent binary       information is stored. The binary information must be specified by the designer and is       then embedded in the unit to form the required interconnection pattern. Once the pat-       tern is established, it stays within the unit even when power is turned off and on again.          A block diagram of a ROM consisting of k inputs and n outputs is shown in Fig. 7.9.       The inputs provide the address for memory, and the outputs give the data bits of the       stored word that is selected by the address. The number of words in a ROM is deter-       mined from the fact that k address input lines are needed to specify 2k words. Note that       ROM does not have data inputs, because it does not have a write operation. Integrated     k inputs (address)                2k  n  n outputs (data)                                       ROM FIGURE 7.9 ROM block diagram circuit ROM chips have one or more enable inputs and sometimes come with three\\\\state outputs to facilitate the construction of large arrays of ROM.    Consider, for example, a 32 * 8 ROM. The unit consists of 32 words of 8 bits each. There are five input lines that form the binary numbers from 0 through 31 for the address. Figure 7.10 shows the internal logic construction of this ROM. The five inputs are decoded into 32 distinct outputs by means of a 5 * 32 decoder. Each output of the decoder represents a memory address. The 32 outputs of the decoder are connected to each of the eight OR gates. The diagram shows the array logic convention used in com- plex circuits. (See Fig. 6.1.) Each OR gate must be considered as having 32 inputs. Each output of the decoder is connected to one of the inputs of each OR gate. Since each OR gate has 32 input connections and there are 8 OR gates, the ROM contains 32 * 8 = 256 internal connections. In general, a 2k * n ROM will have an internal k * 2k decoder and n OR gates. Each OR gate has 2k inputs, which are connected to each of the outputs of the decoder.                         0                                    1 I0 2 I1                      3                   .     5  32 .

A programmable connection between two lines is logically equivalent to a switch that can be altered to be either closed (meaning that the two lines are connected) or open (meaning that the two lines are disconnected). The programmable intersection between two lines is some- times called a crosspoint. Various physical devices are used to implement crosspoint switches. One of the simplest technologies employs a fuse that normally connects the two points, but is opened or blown by the application of a high\\\\voltage pulse into the fuse.    The internal binary storage of a ROM is specified by a truth table that shows the word content in each address. For example, the content of a 32 * 8 ROM may be specified with a truth table similar to the one shown in Table 7.3. The truth table shows the five inputs under which are listed all 32 addresses. Each address stores a word of 8 bits, which is listed in the outputs columns. The table shows only the first four and the last four words in the ROM. The complete table must include the list of all 32 words.    The hardware procedure that programs the ROM blows fuse links in accordance with a given truth table. For example, programming the ROM according to the truth table given by Table 7.3 results in the configuration shown in Fig. 7.11. Every 0 listed in the truth table specifies the absence of a connection, and every 1 listed specifies a path that is obtained by a connection. For example, the table specifies the eight\\\\bit word 10110010 for permanent storage at address 3. The four 0s in the word are programmed by blowing the fuse links between output 3 of the decoder and the inputs of the OR gates associated with outputs A6, A3, A2, and A0. The four 1s in the word are marked with a * to denote a temporary connection, in place of a dot used for a permanent connection in logic diagrams. When the input of the ROM is 00011, all the outputs of the decoder are 0 except for output 3, which is at logic 1. The signal equivalent to logic 1 at decoder output 3 propagates through the connections to the OR gate outputs of A7, A5, A4, and A1. The other four outputs remain at 0. The result is that the stored word 10110010 is applied to the eight data outputs.

By inserting OR gates to sum the minterms of Boolean functions, we were             able to generate any desired combinational circuit. The ROM is essentially a device that             includes both the decoder and the OR gates within a single device to form a minterm             generator. By choosing connections for those minterms which are included in the func-             tion, the ROM outputs can be programmed to represent the Boolean functions of the             output variables in a combinational circuit.                 The internal operation of a ROM can be interpreted in two ways. The first interpreta-             tion is that of a memory unit that contains a fixed pattern of stored words. The second             interpretation is that of a unit which implements a combinational circuit. From this point             of view, each output terminal is considered separately as the output of a Boolean func-             tion expressed as a sum of minterms. For example, the ROM of Fig. 7.11 may be consid-             ered to be a combinational circuit with eight outputs, each a function of the five input             variables. Output A7 can be expressed in sum of minterms as                                          A7(I4, I3, I2, I1, I0) = (0, 2, 3, c, 29)             (The three dots represent minterms 4 through 27, which are not specified in the figure.)             A connection marked with * in the figure produces a minterm for the sum. All other             crosspoints are not connected and are not included in the sum.                 In practice, when a combinational circuit is designed by means of a ROM, it is not             necessary to design the logic or to show the internal gate connections inside the unit. All             that the designer has to do is specify the particular ROM by its IC number and provide             the applicable truth table. The truth table gives all the information for programming the             ROM. No internal logic diagram is needed to accompany the truth table.                                             Section 7.5 Read\\\\Only Memory 319 EXAMPLE 7.1        Design a combinational circuit using a ROM. The circuit accepts a three\\\\bit number and        outputs a binary number equal to the square of the input number.           The first step is to derive the truth table of the combinational circuit. In most cases,        this is all that is needed. In other cases, we can use a partial truth table for the ROM by        utilizing certain properties in the output variables. Table 7.4 is the truth table for the        combinational circuit. Three inputs and six outputs are needed to accommodate all        possible binary numbers. We note that output B0 is always equal to input A0, so there        is no need to generate B0 with a ROM, since it is equal to an input variable. Moreover,        output B1 is always 0, so this output is a known constant. We actually need to generate        only four outputs with the ROM; the other two are readily obtained. The minimum size        of ROM needed must have three inputs and four outputs. Three inputs specify eight        words, so the ROM must be of size 8 * 4. The ROM implementation is shown in        Fig. 7.12. The three inputs specify eight words of four bits each. The truth table in        Fig. 7.12(b) specifies the information needed for programming the ROM. The block        diagram of Fig. 7.12(a) shows the required connections of the combinational circuit.

The first             is called mask programming and is done by the semiconductor company during the             last fabrication process of the unit. The procedure for fabricating a ROM requires             that the customer fill out the truth table he or she wishes the ROM to satisfy. The             truth table may be submitted in a special form provided by the manufacturer or in             a specified format on a computer output medium. The manufacturer makes the cor-             responding mask for the paths to produce the 1s and 0s according to the customers             truth table. This procedure is costly because the vendor charges the customer a             special fee for custom masking the particular ROM. For this reason, mask program-             ming is economical only if a large quantity of the same ROM configuration is to be             ordered.                 For small quantities, it is more economical to use a second type of ROM called pro-             grammable read\\\\only memory, or PROM. When ordered, PROM units contain all the             fuses intact, giving all 1s in the bits of the stored words. The fuses in the PROM are             blown by the application of a high\\\\voltage pulse to the device through a special pin.             A blown fuse defines a binary 0 state and an intact fuse gives a binary 1 state. This pro-             cedure allows the user to program the PROM in the laboratory to achieve the desired             relationship between input addresses and stored words. Special instruments called             PROM programmers are available commercially to facilitate the procedure. In any case,             all procedures for programming ROMs are hardware procedures, even though the word             programming is used.                 The hardware procedure for programming ROMs or PROMs is irreversible, and once             programmed, the fixed pattern is permanent and cannot be altered. Once a bit pattern             has been established, the unit must be discarded if the bit pattern is to be changed. A             third type of ROM is the erasable PROM, or EPROM, which can be restructured to the             initial state even though it has been programmed previously. When the EPROM is             placed under a special ultraviolet light for a given length of time, the shortwave radiation             discharges the internal floating gates that serve as the programmed connections. After             erasure, the EPROM returns to its initial state and can be reprogrammed to a new set             of values.                 The fourth type of ROM is the electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM or E2PROM).             This device is like the EPROM, except that the previously programmed connections can             be erased with an electrical signal instead of ultraviolet light. The advantage is that the             device can be erased without removing it from its socket.                 Flash memory devices are similar to EEPROMs, but have additional built\\\\in circuitry             to selectively program and erase the device in\\\\circuit, without the need for a special             programmer. They have widespread application in modern technology in cell phones,             digital cameras, set\\\\top boxes, digital TV, telecommunications, nonvolatile data storage,             and microcontrollers. Their low consumption of power makes them an attractive storage             medium for laptop and notebook computers. Flash memories incorporate additional             circuitry, too, allowing simultaneous erasing of blocks of memory, for example, of size             16 to 64 K bytes. Like EEPROMs, flash memories are subject to fatigue, typically having             about 105 block erase cycles.

There are three major types of combina-             tional PLDs, differing in the placement of the programmable connections in the ANDC             OR array. Figure 7.13 shows the configuration of the three PLDs. The PROM has a fixed             AND array constructed as a decoder and a programmable OR array. The programmable             OR gates implement the Boolean functions in sum\\\\of\\\\minterms form. The PAL has a             programmable AND array and a fixed OR array. The AND gates are programmed to             provide the product terms for the Boolean functions, which are logically summed in each             OR gate. The most flexible PLD is the PLA, in which both the AND and OR arrays can             be programmed. The product terms in the AND array may be shared by any OR gate             to provide the required sum\\\\of\\\\products implementation. The names PAL and PLA             emerged from different vendors during the development of PLDs. The implementation             of combinational circuits with PROM was demonstrated in this section. The design of             combinational circuits with PLA and PAL is presented in the next two sections. 7.6  PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC ARRAY       The PLA is similar in concept to the PROM, except that the PLA does not provide full       decoding of the variables and does not generate all the minterms. The decoder is       replaced by an array of AND gates that can be programmed to generate any product             term of the input variables. The product terms are then connected to OR gates to pro-             vide the sum of products for the required Boolean functions.                 The internal logic of a PLA with three inputs and two outputs is shown in Fig. 7.14.             Such a circuit is too small to be useful commercially, but is presented here to demonstrate             the typical logic configuration of a PLA. The diagram uses the array logic graphic symbols             for complex circuits. Each input goes through a bufferCinverter combination, shown in the             diagram with a composite graphic symbol, that has both the true and complement outputs.             Each input and its complement are connected to the inputs of each AND gate, as indicated             by the intersections between the vertical and horizontal lines. The outputs of the AND             gates are connected to the inputs of each OR gate. The output of the OR gate goes to an             XOR gate, where the other input can be programmed to receive a signal equal to either             logic 1 or logic 0. The output is inverted when the XOR input is connected to 1 (since             x { 1 = x). The output does not change when the XOR input is connected to 0 (since             x { 0 = x). The particular Boolean functions implemented in the PLA of Fig. 7.14 are                                                    F1 = AB + AC + ABC                                                    F2 = (AC + BC)                 A B C    1                                          AB    2                                          AC    3                                          BC                                            4  ABC    C C B B A A                                                                  0                                                                  1                                                                                  F1                                                                                                                                        F2    FIGURE 7.14    PLA with three inputs, four product terms, and two outputs                                             Section 7.6 Programmable Logic Array 323 The product terms generated in each AND gate are listed along the output of the gate in the diagram. The product term is determined from the inputs whose crosspoints are connected and marked with a *. The output of an OR gate gives the logical sum of the selected product terms. The output may be complemented or left in its true form, depending on the logic being realized.    The fuse map of a PLA can be specified in a tabular form. For example, the program- ming table that specifies the PLA of Fig. 7.14 is listed in Table 7.5.The PLA programming table consists of three sections. The first section lists the product terms numerically. The second section specifies the required paths between inputs and AND gates. The third section specifies the paths between the AND and OR gates. For each output variable, we may have a T (for true) or C (for complement) for programming the XOR gate. The product terms listed on the left are not part of the table; they are included for reference only. For each product term, the inputs are marked with 1, 0, or  (dash). If a variable in the product term appears in the form in which it is true, the corresponding input vari- able is marked with a 1. If it appears complemented, the corresponding input variable is marked with a 0. If the variable is absent from the product term, it is marked with a dash.    The paths between the inputs and the AND gates are specified under the column head Inputs in the programming table. A 1 in the input column specifies a connection from the input variable to the AND gate. A 0 in the input column specifies a connection from the complement of the variable to the input of the AND gate. A dash specifies a blown fuse in both the input variable and its complement. It is assumed that an open terminal in the input of an AND gate behaves like a 1.    The paths between the AND and OR gates are specified under the column head Outputs. The output variables are marked with 1s for those product terms which are included in the function. Each product term that has a 1 in the output column requires a path from the output of the AND gate to the input of the OR gate. Those marked with a dash specify a blown fuse. It is assumed that an open terminal in the input of an OR gate behaves like a 0. Finally, a T (true) output dictates that the other input of the corresponding XOR gate be connected to 0, and a C (complement) specifies a connection to 1.

The size of a PLA is specified by the number of inputs, the number of product terms,             and the number of outputs. A typical integrated circuit PLA may have 16 inputs, 48             product terms, and eight outputs. For n inputs, k product terms, and m outputs, the inter-             nal logic of the PLA consists of n bufferCinverter gates, k AND gates, m OR gates, and             m XOR gates. There are 2n * k connections between the inputs and the AND array,             k * m connections between the AND and OR arrays, and m connections associated             with the XOR gates.                 In designing a digital system with a PLA, there is no need to show the internal con-             nections of the unit as was done in Fig. 7.14. All that is needed is a PLA programming             table from which the PLA can be programmed to supply the required logic. As with a             ROM, the PLA may be mask programmable or field programmable. With mask pro-             gramming, the customer submits a PLA program table to the manufacturer. This table             is used by the vendor to produce a custom\\\\made PLA that has the required internal             logic specified by the customer. A second type of PLA that is available is the field\\\\             programmable logic array, or FPLA, which can be programmed by the user by means             of a commercial hardware programmer unit.                 In implementing a combinational circuit with a PLA, careful investigation must be             undertaken in order to reduce the number of distinct product terms, since a PLA has a             finite number of AND gates. This can be done by simplifying each Boolean function to             a minimum number of terms. The number of literals in a term is not important, since all             the input variables are available anyway. Both the true value and the complement of             each function should be simplified to see which one can be expressed with fewer prod-             uct terms and which one provides product terms that are common to other functions.     EXAMPLE 7.2             Implement the following two Boolean functions with a PLA:                                                    F1(A, B, C) = g (0, 1, 2, 4)                                                    F2(A, B, C) = g (0, 5, 6, 7)             The two functions are simplified in the maps of Fig. 7.15. Both the true value and the             complement of the functions are simplified into sum\\\\of\\\\products form. The combination             that gives the minimum number of product terms is                                                     F1 = (AB + AC + BC)             and                                                    F2 = AB + AC + ABC             This combination gives four distinct product terms: AB, AC, BC, and ABC. The PLA             programming table for the combination is shown in the figure. Note that output F1 is             the true output, even though a C is marked over it in the table. This is because F1 is             generated with an ANDCOR circuit and is available at the output of the OR gate. The             XOR gate complements the function to produce the true F1 output.

It was presented merely for purposes of illustration. A typical PLA has a large         number of inputs and product terms. The simplification of Boolean functions with so         many variables should be carried out by means of computer\\\\assisted simplification pro-         cedures. The computer\\\\aided design (CAD) program simplifies each function and its         complement to a minimum number of terms. The program then selects a minimum         number of product terms that cover all functions in the form in which they are true or         in their complemented form. The PLA programming table is then generated and the         required fuse map obtained. The fuse map is applied to an FPLA programmer that goes         through the hardware procedure of blowing the internal fuses in the integrated circuit. 7.7     PROGRAMMABLE ARRAY LOGIC          The PAL is a programmable logic device with a fixed OR array and a programmable          AND array. Because only the AND gates are programmable, the PAL is easier to pro-          gram than, but is not as flexible as, the PLA. Figure 7.16 shows the logic configuration of          a typical PAL with four inputs and four outputs. Each input has a bufferCinverter gate,          and each output is generated by a fixed OR gate. There are four sections in the unit,          each composed of an ANDCOR array that is three wide, the term used to indicate that          there are three programmable AND gates in each section and one fixed OR gate. Each          AND gate has 10 programmable input connections, shown in the diagram by 10 vertical          lines intersecting each horizontal line. The horizontal line symbolizes the multiple\\\\input          configuration of the AND gate. One of the outputs is connected to a bufferCinverter          gate and then fed back into two inputs of the AND gates.             Commercial PAL devices contain more gates than the one shown in Fig. 7.16. A typical          PAL integrated circuit may have eight inputs, eight outputs, and eight sections, each con-          sisting of an eight\\\\wide ANDCOR array. The output terminals are sometimes driven by          three\\\\state buffers or inverters.             In designing with a PAL, the Boolean functions must be simplified to fit into each          section. Unlike the situation with a PLA, a product term cannot be shared among two          or more OR gates. Therefore, each function can be simplified by itself, without regard     Product                          AND gates inputs       term          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10              1              2                                                               F1                      3 I1              4              5                                                               F2              6 I2              7              8                                                               F3              9 I3              10              11                                                              F4                     12 I4                              1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10     FIGURE 7.16     PAL with four inputs, four outputs, and a three\\\\wide ANDCOR structure                                             Section 7.7 Programmable Array Logic 327 to common product terms. The number of product terms in each section is fixed, and if the number of terms in the function is too large, it may be necessary to use two sections to implement one Boolean function.    As an example of using a PAL in the design of a combinational circuit, consider the following Boolean functions, given in sum\\\\of\\\\minterms form:                         w(A, B, C, D) = g (2, 12, 13)                         x(A, B, C, D) = g (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)                         y(A, B, C, D) = g (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15)                         z(A, B, C, D) = g (1, 2, 8, 12, 13) Simplifying the four functions to a minimum number of terms results in the following Boolean functions:                         w = ABC + ABCD                          x = A + BCD                          y = AB + CD + BD                          z = ABC + ABCD + ACD + ABCD                             = w + ACD + ABCD Note that the function for z has four product terms. The logical sum of two of these terms is equal to w. By using w, it is possible to reduce the number of terms for z from four to three.    The PAL programming table is similar to the one used for the PLA, except that only the inputs of the AND gates need to be programmed.

The table is divided into four sec-      tions with three product terms in each, to conform with the PAL of Fig. 7.16.

For each dash, we mark the diagram with blown fuses in both      the true and complement inputs. If the AND gate is not used, we leave all its input fuses      intact. Since the corresponding input receives both the true value and the complement of      each input variable, we have AA = 0 and the output of the AND gate is always 0.         As with all PLDs, the design with PALs is facilitated by using CAD techniques. The      blowing of internal fuses is a hardware procedure done with the help of special elec-      tronic instruments. 7.8  SEQUENTIAL PROGRAMMABLE DEVICES       Digital systems are designed with flip\\\\flops and gates. Since the combinational PLD       consists of only gates, it is necessary to include external flip\\\\flops when they are used in       the design. Sequential programmable devices include both gates and flip\\\\flops. In this       way, the device can be programmed to perform a variety of sequential\\\\circuit functions.       There are several types of sequential programmable devices available commercially, and       each device has vendor\\\\specific variants within each type. The internal logic of these       devices is too complex to be shown here. Therefore, we will describe three major types       without going into their detailed construction:          1. Sequential (or simple) programmable logic device (SPLD)          2. Complex programmable logic device (CPLD)          3. Field\\\\programmable gate array (FPGA)       The sequential PLD is sometimes referred to as a simple PLD to differentiate it from       the complex PLD. The SPLD includes flip\\\\flops, in addition to the ANDCOR array,       within the integrated circuit chip. The result is a sequential circuit as shown in Fig. 7.18.       A PAL or PLA is modified by including a number of flip\\\\flops connected to form a       register. The circuit outputs can be taken from the OR gates or from the outputs of the      Inputs              ANDCOR array                             Outputs              (PAL or PLA)                                            Flip-flops      FIGURE 7.18      Sequential programmable logic device             flip\\\\flops. Additional programmable connections are available to include the flip\\\\flop             outputs in the product terms formed with the AND array. The flip\\\\flops may be of the             D or the JK type.                 The first programmable device developed to support sequential circuit implementation             is the field\\\\programmable logic sequencer (FPLS). A typical FPLS is organized around a             PLA with several outputs driving flip\\\\flops. The flip\\\\flops are flexible in that they can be             programmed to operate as either the JK or the D type. The FPLS did not succeed com-             mercially, because it has too many programmable connections. The configuration mostly             used in an SPLD is the combinational PAL together with D flip\\\\flops. A PAL that includes             flip\\\\flops is referred to as a registered PAL, to signify that the device contains flip\\\\flops in             addition to the ANDCOR array. Each section of an SPLD is called a macrocell, which is             a circuit that contains a sum\\\\of\\\\products combinational logic function and an optional             flip\\\\flop. We will assume an ANDCOR sum\\\\of\\\\products function, but in practice, it can be             any one of the two\\\\level implementations presented in Section 3.7.                 Figure 7.19 shows the logic of a basic macrocell. The ANDCOR array is the same as             in the combinational PAL shown in Fig. 7.16. The output is driven by an edge\\\\triggered             D flip\\\\flop connected to a common clock input and changes state on a clock edge. The             output of the flip\\\\flop is connected to a three\\\\state buffer (or inverter) controlled by an             output\\\\enable signal marked in the diagram as OE. The output of the flip\\\\flop is fed             back into one of the inputs of the programmable AND gates to provide the present\\\\state             condition for the sequential circuit. A typical SPLD has from 8 to 10 macrocells within                                                                  CLK OE                                                                                                                            D                                                                                                                               CLK                   FIGURE 7.19                   Basic macrocell logic                                          Section 7.8 Sequential Programmable Devices 331        one IC package. All the flip\\\\flops are connected to the common CLK input, and all        three\\\\state buffers are controlled by the OE input.           In addition to programming the AND array, a macrocell may have other program-        ming features. Typical programming options include the ability to either use or bypass        the flip\\\\flop, the selection of clock edge polarity, the selection of preset and clear for the        register, and the selection of the true value or complement of an output. An XOR gate        is used to program a true/complement condition. Multiplexers select between two or        four distinct paths by programming the selection inputs.           The design of a digital system using PLDs often requires the connection of several        devices to produce the complete specification. For this type of application, it is more        economical to use a complex programmable logic device (CPLD), which is a collection        of individual PLDs on a single integrated circuit. A programmable interconnection        structure allows the PLDs to be connected to each other in the same way that can be        done with individual PLDs.           Figure 7.20 shows the general configuration of a CPLD. The device consists of mul-        tiple PLDs interconnected through a programmable switch matrix. The inputCoutput        (I/O) blocks provide the connections to the IC pins. Each I/O pin is driven by a three\\\\        state buffer and can be programmed to act as input or output. The switch matrix receives        inputs from the I/O block and directs them to the individual macrocells. Similarly,        selected outputs from macrocells are sent to the outputs as needed. Each PLD typically        contains from 8 to 16 macrocells, usually fully connected. If a macrocell has unused        product terms, they can be used by other nearby macrocells. In some cases the macrocell        flip\\\\flop is programmed to act as a D, JK, or T flip\\\\flop.           Different manufacturers have taken different approaches to the general architecture        of CPLDs. Areas in which they differ include the individual PLDs (sometimes called        PLD  PLD                    PLD  PLD                                         PLD  I/O        Programmable switch matrix        I/O block                                        block        PLD  PLD                    PLD        FIGURE 7.20        General CPLD configuration             function blocks), the type of macrocells, the I/O blocks, and the programmable intercon-             nection structure. The best way to investigate a vendor\\\\specific device is to look at the             manufacturers literature.                 The basic component used in VLSI design is the gate array, which consists of a pattern             of gates, fabricated in an area of silicon, that is repeated thousands of times until the entire             chip is covered with gates. Arrays of one thousand to several hundred thousand gates are             fabricated within a single IC chip, depending on the technology used. The design with             gate arrays requires that the customer provide the manufacturer the desired interconnec-             tion pattern. The first few levels of the fabrication process are common and independent             of the final logic function. Additional fabrication steps are required to interconnect the             gates according to the specifications given by the designer.                 A field\\\\programmable gate array (FPGA) is a VLSI circuit that can be programmed             at the users location. A typical FPGA consists of an array of millions of logic blocks,             surrounded by programmable input and output blocks and connected together via pro-             grammable interconnections. There is a wide variety of internal configurations within             this group of devices. The performance of each type of device depends on the circuit             contained in its logic blocks and the efficiency of its programmed interconnections.                 A typical FPGA logic block consists of lookup tables, multiplexers, gates, and             flip\\\\flops. A lookup table is a truth table stored in an SRAM and provides the com-             binational circuit functions for the logic block. These functions are realized from the             lookup table, in the same way that combinational circuit functions are implemented             with ROM, as described in Section 7.5. For example, a 16 * 2 SRAM can store the             truth table of a combinational circuit that has four inputs and two outputs. The             combinational logic section, along with a number of programmable multiplexers, is             used to configure the input equations for the flip\\\\flop and the output of the logic             block.                 The advantage of using RAM instead of ROM to store the truth table is that the table             can be programmed by writing into memory. The disadvantage is that the memory is             volatile and presents the need for the lookup tables content to be reloaded in the event             that power is disrupted. The program can be downloaded either from a host computer             or from an onboard PROM. The program remains in SRAM until the FPGA is repro-             grammed or the power is turned off. The device must be reprogrammed every time             power is turned on. The ability to reprogram the FPGA can serve a variety of applica-             tions by using different logic implementations in the program.                 The design with PLD, CPLD, or FPGA requires extensive computer\\\\aided design             (CAD) tools to facilitate the synthesis procedure. Among the tools that are available             are schematic entry packages and hardware description languages (HDLs), such as             ABEL, VHDL, and Verilog. Synthesis tools are available that allocate, configure, and             connect logic blocks to match a high\\\\level design description written in HDL. As an             example of CMOS FPGA technology, we will discuss the Xilinx FPGA.1                1 See www.Altera.com for an alternative CMOS FPGA architecture.                                               Section 7.8 Sequential Programmable Devices 333 Xilinx FPGAs             Xilinx launched the worlds first commercial FPGA in 1985, with the vintage XC2000             device family.2 The XC3000 and XC4000 families soon followed, setting the stage for             todays Spartan, and Virtex device families. Each evolution of devices brought             improvements in density, performance, power consumption, voltage levels, pin counts, and             functionality. For example, the Spartan family of devices initially offered a maximum of             40K system gates, but todays Spartan\\\\6 offers 150,000 logic cells plus 4.8Mb block RAM. Basic Xilinx Architecture             The basic architecture of Spartan and earlier device families consists of an array of             configurable logic blocks (CLBs), a variety of local and global routing resources, and             inputCoutput (I/O) blocks (IOBs), programmable I/O buffers, and an SRAM\\\\based             configuration memory, as shown in Fig. 7.21.

Configurable Logic Block (CLB)             Each CLB consists of a programmable lookup table, multiplexers, registers, and paths for             control signals, as shown in Fig. 7.22.Two of the function generators (F and G) of the lookup             table can generate any arbitrary function of four inputs, and the third (H) can generate any             Boolean function of three inputs. The H\\\\function block can get its inputs from the F and             G lookup tables or from external inputs. The three function generators can be programmed             to generate (1) three different functions of three independent sets of variables (two with             four inputs and one with three inputsone function must be registered within the CLB),             (2) an arbitrary function of five variables, (3) an arbitrary function of four variables together             with some functions of six variables, and (4) some functions of nine variables.                 Each CLB has two storage devices that can be configured as edge\\\\triggered flip\\\\flops             with a common clock, or, in the XC4000X, they can be configured as flip\\\\flops or as             transparent latches with a common clock (programmed for either edge and separately             invertible) and an enable. The storage elements can get their inputs from the function             generators or from the Din input. The other element can get an external input from the             H1 input. The function generators can also drive two outputs (X and Y) directly and             independently of the outputs of the storage elements. All of these outputs can be con-             nected to the interconnect network. The storage elements are driven by a global set/             reset during power\\\\up; the global set/reset is programmed to match the programming             of the local S/R control for a given storage element. Distributed RAM             The three function generators within a CLB can be used as either a 16 * 2 dual\\\\port             RAM or a 32 * 1 single\\\\port RAM. The XC4000 devices do not have block RAM, but             a group of their CLBs can form an array of memory. Spartan devices have block RAM             in addition to distributed RAM. Interconnect Resources             A grid of switch matrices overlays the architecture of CLBs to provide general\\\\purpose             interconnect for branching and routing throughout the device. The interconnect has             three types of general\\\\purpose interconnects: single\\\\length lines, double\\\\length lines,             and long lines. A grid of horizontal and vertical single\\\\length lines connects an array of             switch boxes that provide a reduced number of connections between signal paths within             each box, not a full crossbar switch. Each CLB has a pair of three\\\\state buffers that can             drive signals onto the nearest horizontal lines above or below the CLB.                 Direct (dedicated) interconnect lines provide routing between adjacent vertical and             horizontal CLBs in the same column or row. These are relatively high speed local con-             nections through metal, but are not as fast as a hardwired metal connection because of             the delay incurred by routing the signal paths through the transmission gates that con-             figure the path. Direct interconnect lines do not use the switch matrices, thus eliminating             the delay incurred on paths going through a matrix.3                3 See Xilinx documentation for the pin\\\\out conventions to establish local interconnects between CLBs.

These lines provide a more efficient implementation of intermediate\\\\length connections by eliminating a switch matrix from the path, thereby reducing the delay of the path.    Long lines span the entire array vertically and horizontally. They drive low\\\\skew, high\\\\fan\\\\out control signals. Long vertical lines have a programmable splitter that seg- ments the lines and allows two independent routing channels spanning one\\\\half of the array, but located in the same column. The routing resources are exploited automatically by the routing software. There are eight low\\\\skew global buffers for clock distribution.    The signals that drive long lines are buffered. Long lines can be driven by adjacent CLBs or IOBs and may connect to three\\\\state buffers that are available to CLBs. Long lines provide three\\\\state buses within the architecture and implement wired\\\\AND logic. Each horizontal long line is driven by a three\\\\state buffer and can be programmed to connect to a pull\\\\up resistor, which pulls the line to a logical 1 if no driver is asserted on the line.    The programmable interconnect resources of the device connect CLBs and IOBs, either directly or through switch boxes. These resources consist of a grid of two layers of metal segments and programmable interconnect points (PIPs) within switch boxes. A PIP is a CMOS transmission gate whose state (on or off) is determined by the content of a static RAM cell in the programmable memory, as shown in Fig. 7.23. The connection is estab- lished when the transmission gate is on (i.e., when a 1 is applied at the gate of the n\\\\channel transistor), and a 0 is applied at the gate of the p\\\\channel transistor. Thus, the device can be reprogrammed simply by changing the contents of the controlling memory cell.    The architecture of a PIP\\\\based interconnection in a switch box is shown in Fig. 7.24, which shows possible signal paths through a PIP. The configuration of CMOS transmis- sion gates determines the connection between a horizontal line and the opposite hori- zontal line and between the vertical lines at the connection. Each switch matrix PIP requires six pass transistors to establish full connectivity.                                               Section 7.8 Sequential Programmable Devices 337                   FIGURE 7.24                   Circuit for a programmable PIP I/O Block (IOB)             Each programmable I/O pin has a programmable IOB having buffers for compatibility             with TTL and CMOS signal levels. Figure 7.25 shows a simplified schematic for a pro-             grammable IOB. It can be used as an input, an output, or a bidirectional port. An IOB             that is configured as an input can have direct, latched, or registered input. In an output             configuration, the IOB has direct or registered output. The output buffer of an IOB has             skew and slew control. The registers available to the input and output path of an IOB             are driven by separate, invertible clocks. There is a global set/reset.                 Internal delay elements compensate for the delay induced when a clock signal passes             through a global buffer before reaching an IOB. This strategy eliminates the hold condi-             tion on the data at an external pin. The three\\\\state output of an IOB puts the output             buffer in a high\\\\impedance state. The output and the enable for the output can be             inverted. The slew rate of the output buffer can be controlled to minimize transients on             the power bus when noncritical signals are switched. The IOB pin can be programmed             for pull\\\\up or pull\\\\down to prevent needless power consumption and noise.                 The devices have embedded logic to support the IEEE 1149.1 (JTAG) boundary scan             standard. There is an on\\\\chip test access port (TAP) controller, and the I/O cells can be             configured as a shift register. Under testing, the device can be checked to verify that all             the pins on a PC board are connected and operate properly by creating a serial chain of             all of the I/O pins of the chips on the board. A master three\\\\state control signal puts all             of the IOBs in high\\\\impedance mode for board testing.

Dual\\\\port RAMs are emulated in a Spartan device by the structure shown in Fig. 7.27,             which has a single (common) write port and two asynchronous read ports. A CLB can             form a memory having a maximum size of 16 * 1. Xilinx Spartan XL FPGAs             Spartan XL chips are a further enhancement of Spartan chips, offering higher speed and             density (40,000 system gates, approximately 6,000 of which are usable) and on\\\\chip,             distributed SelectRAM memory.4 The lookup tables of the devices can implement 22n             different functions of n inputs.                4 The maximum number of logic gates for a Xilinx FPGA is an estimate of the maximum number of logic gates that                could be realized in a design consisting of only logic functions (no memory). Logic capacity is expressed in terms                of the number of two\\\\input NAND gates that would be required to implement the same number and type of logic                functions (Xilinx App. Note).

The XL series is targeted for applications for which low cost, low power, low packag- ing, and low test cost are important factors constraining the design. Spartan XL devices offer up to 80\\\\MHz system performance, depending on the number of cascaded lookup tables, which reduce performance by introducing longer paths. Table 7.7 presents sig- nificant attributes of devices in the Spartan XL family.    The architecture of the Spartan XL and earlier devices consists of an array of CLB tiles mingled within an array of switch matrices, surrounded by a perimeter of IOBs. These devices support only distributed memory, whose use reduces the number of CLBs that could be used for logic. The relatively small amount of on\\\\chip memory limits the devices to applications in which operations with off\\\\chip memory devices do not compromise performance objectives. Beginning with the Spartan II series, Xilinx supported configurable embedded block memory, as well as distributed memory in a new architecture. Xilinx Spartan II FPGAs             Aside from improvements in speed (200\\\\MHz I/O switching frequency), density (up to             200,000 system gates) and operating voltage (2.5 V), four other features distinguish the             Spartan II devices from the Spartan devices: (1) on\\\\chip block memory, (2) a novel             architecture, (3) support for multiple I/O standards, and (4) delay locked loops (DLLs).5                 The Spartan II device family, manufactured in 0.22 >0.18@mm CMOS technology with             six layers of metal for interconnect, incorporates configurable block memory in addition             to the distributed memory of the previous generations of devices, and the block memory             does not reduce the amount of logic or distributed memory that is available for the 5 Spartan II devices do not support low\\\\voltage differential signaling (LVDS) or low\\\\voltage positive emitter\\\\coupled logic (LVPECL) I/O standards.                                   Section 7.8 Sequential Programmable Devices 341 application. A large on\\\\chip memory can improve system performance by eliminating or reducing the need to access off\\\\chip storage.    Reliable clock distribution is the key to the synchronous operation of high\\\\speed digital circuits. If the clock signal arrives at different times at different parts of a circuit, the device may fail to operate correctly. Clock skew reduces the available time budget of a circuit by lengthening the setup time at registers. It can also shorten the effective hold\\\\time margin of a flip\\\\flop in a shift register and cause the register to shift incor- rectly. At high clock frequencies (shorter clock periods), the effect of skew is more significant because it represents a larger fraction of the clock cycle time. Buffered clock trees are commonly used to minimize clock skew in FPGAs. Xilinx provides all\\\\digital DLLs for clock synchronization or management in high\\\\speed circuits. DLLs eliminate the clock distribution delay and provide frequency multipliers, frequency dividers, and clock mirrors.    Spartan II devices are suitable for applications such as implementing the glue logic of a video capture system and the glue logic of an ISDN modem.

Each of four quadrants of CLBs is supported by a DLL and is flanked by a 4,096\\\\bit block6 of RAM, and the periphery of the chip is lined with IOBs.    Each CLB contains four logic cells, organized as a pair of slices. Each logic cell, shown in Fig. 7.29, has a four\\\\input lookup table, logic for carry and control, and a D\\\\type flip\\\\flop.

Such systems are said to have memory. A digital system is a sequential logic system       constructed with flip\\\\flops and gates. Sequential circuits can be specified by means of       state tables as shown in Chapter 5. To specify a large digital system with a state table is       very difficult, because the number of states would be enormous. To overcome this dif-       ficulty, digital systems are designed via a modular approach. The system is partitioned       into subsystems, each of which performs some function. The modules are constructed       from such digital devices as registers, decoders, multiplexers, arithmetic elements, and       control logic. The various modules are interconnected with datapaths and control signals       to form a digital system. In this chapter, we will introduce a design methodology for       describing and designing large, complex digital systems. 8.2  REGISTER TRANSFER LEVEL NOTATION       The modules of a digital system are best defined by a set of registers and the opera-       tions that are performed on the binary information stored in them. Examples of       register operations are shift, count, clear, and load. Registers are assumed to be the       basic components of the digital system. The information flow and processing per-       formed on the data stored in the registers are referred to as register transfer opera-       tions. Well see subsequently how a hardware description language (HDL) includes       operators that correspond to the register transfer operations of a digital system.                                                                                                                  351             A digital system is represented at the register transfer level (RTL) when it is specified             by the following three components:                 1. The set of registers in the system.                 2. The operations that are performed on the data stored in the registers.                 3. The control that supervises the sequence of operations in the system.             A register is a connected group of flip\\\\flops that stores binary information and has the             capability of performing one or more elementary operations. A register can load new             information or shift the information to the right or the left. A counter is a register that             increments a number by a fixed value (e.g., 1). A flip\\\\flop is a one\\\\bit register that can             be set, cleared, or complemented. In fact, the flip\\\\flops and associated gates of any             sequential circuit can be called registers by this definition.                 The operations executed on the information stored in registers are elementary oper-             ations that are performed in parallel on the bits of a data word during one clock cycle.             The data produced by the operation may replace the binary information that was in the             register before the operation executed. Alternatively, the result may be transferred to             another register (i.e., an operation on a register may leave its contents unchanged). The             digital circuits introduced in Chapter 6 are registers that implement elementary opera-             tions. A counter with a parallel load is able to perform the increment\\\\by\\\\one and load             operations. A bidirectional shift register is able to perform the shift\\\\right and shift\\\\left             operations by shifting its contents by one or more bits in a specified direction.                 The operations in a digital system are controlled by signals that sequence the opera-             tions in a prescribed manner. Certain conditions that depend on results of previous             operations may determine the sequence of future operations. The outputs of the control             logic of a digital system are binary variables that initiate the various operations in the             systems registers.                 Information transfer from one register to another is designated in symbolic form by             means of a replacement operator. The statement                                                                R2 d R1             denotes a transfer of the contents of register R1 into register R2that is, a replacement             of the contents of register R2 by the contents of register R1. For example, an eight\\\\bit             register R2 holding the value 01011010 could have its contents replaced by R1 holding             the value 10100101. By definition, the contents of the source register R1 do not change             after the transfer. They are merely copied to R1. The arrow symbolizes the transfer and             its direction; it points from the register whose contents are being transferred and towards             the register that will receive the contents. A control signal would determine when the             operation actually executes.                 The controller in a digital system is a finite state machine (see Chapter 5) whose             outputs are the control signals governing the register operations. In synchronous             machines, the operations are synchronized by the system clock. For example, register             R2 might be synchronized to have its contents replaced at the positive edge of the clock.                 A statement that specifies a register transfer operation implies that a datapath (i.e.,             a set of circuit connections) is available from the outputs of the source register to the Section 8.2 Register Transfer Level Notation 353 inputs of the destination register and that the destination register has a parallel load capability. Data can be transferred serially between registers, too, by repeatedly shifting their contents along a single wire, one bit at a time. Normally, we want a register transfer operation to occur, not with every clock cycle, but only under a predetermined condition. A conditional statement governing a register transfer operation is symbolized with an ifCthen statement such as If (T1 = 1) then (R2 d R1) where T1 is a control signal generated in the control section. Note that the clock is not included as a variable in the register transfer statements. It is assumed that all transfers occur at a clock\\\\edge transition (i.e., a transition from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). Although a control condition such as T1 may become true before the clock transition, the actual transfer does not occur until the clock transition does. The transfers are initiated and synchronized by the action of the clock signal, but the actual transition of the outputs (in a physical system) does not result in instantaneous transitions at the outputs of the registers. Propagation delays depend on the physical characteristics of the transistors implementing the flip\\\\flops of the register and the wires connecting devices. There is always a delay, however small, between a cause and its effect in a physical system.    A comma may be used to separate two or more operations that are executed at the same time (concurrently). Consider the statement If (T3 = 1) then (R2 d R1, R1 d R2) This statement specifies an operation that exchanges the contents of two registers; more- over, the operation in both registers is triggered by the same clock edge, provided that T3 = 1. This simultaneous (concurrent) operation is possible with registers that have edge\\\\triggered flip\\\\flops controlled by a common clock (synchronizing signal). Other examples of register transfers are as follows: R1 d R1 + R2  Add contents of R2 to R1 (R1 gets R1 + R2) R3 d R3 + 1   Increment R3 by 1 (count upwards) R4 d shr R4   Shift right R4 R5 d 0        Clear R5 to 0 In hardware, addition is done with a binary parallel adder, incrementing is done with a counter, and the shift operation is implemented with a shift register. The type of opera- tions most often encountered in digital systems can be classified into four categories: 1. Transfer operations, which transfer (i.e., copy) data from one register to another. 2. Arithmetic operations, which perform arithmetic (e.g., multiplication) on data in    registers. 3. Logic operations, which perform bit manipulation (e.g., logical OR) of nonnumeric    data in registers. 4. Shift operations, which shift data between registers. The transfer operation does not change the information content of the data being moved from the source register to the destination register unless the source and destination are             the same. The other three operations change the information content during the trans-             fer. The register transfer notation and the symbols used to represent the various regis-             ter transfer operations are not standardized. In this text, we employ two types of             notation. The notation introduced in this section will be used informally to specify and             explain digital systems at the register transfer level. The next section introduces the             RTL symbols used in the Verilog HDL, which is standardized. 8.3  REGISTER TRANSFER LEVEL IN HDL      Digital systems can be described at the register transfer level by means of a HDL. In the      Verilog HDL, descriptions of RTL operations use a combination of behavioral and data-      flow constructs and are employed to specify the register operations and the combina-      tional logic functions implemented by hardware. Register transfers are specified by      means of procedural assignment statements within an edge\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior.      Combinational circuit functions are specified at the RTL level by means of continuous      assignment statements or by procedural assignment statements within a level\\\\sensitive      cyclic behavior. The symbol used to designate a register transfer is either an equals sign      (=) or an arrow (6 =); the symbol used to specify a combinational circuit function is an      equals sign. Synchronization with the clock is represented by associating with an always      statement an event control expression in which sensitivity to the clock event is qualified      by posedge or negedge.The always keyword indicates that the associated block of state-      ments will be executed repeatedly, for the life of the simulation. The @ operator and the      event control expression preceding the block of statements synchronize the execution      of the statements to the clock event.         The following examples show the various ways to specify a register transfer operation      in Verilog:      (a) assign S = A + B;         // Continuous assignment for addition operation      (b) always @ (A, B)           // Level-sensitive cyclic behavior                                    // Combinational logic for addition operation            S = A + B;              // Edge-sensitive cyclic behavior      (c) always @ (negedge clock)                                    // Blocking procedural assignment for addition            begin                   // Register transfer operation             RA = RA + RB;             RD = RA;               // Edge-sensitive cyclic behavior            end                                    // Nonblocking procedural assignment for addition      (d) always @ (negedge clock)  // Register transfer operation            begin             RA <= RA + RB;             RD <= RA;            end         Continuous assignments (e.g., assign S = A + B;) are used to represent and specify      combinational logic circuits. In simulation, a continuous assignment statement executes      when the expression on the right\\\\hand side changes. The effect of execution is immediate.                                                     Section 8.3 Register Transfer Level in HDL 355             (The variable on the left\\\\hand side is updated.) Similarly, a level\\\\sensitive cyclic behav-             ior (e.g., always @ (A, B)) executes during simulation when a change is detected by its             event control expression (sensitivity list). The effect of assignments made by the = oper-             ator is immediate. The continuous assignment statement (assign S = A + B) describes a             binary adder with inputs A and B and output S. The target operand in a continuous             assignment statement (S in this case) cannot be a register data type, but must be a type             of net, for example, wire. The procedural assignment made in the level\\\\sensitive cyclic             behavior in the second example shows an alternative way of specifying a combinational             circuit for addition. Within the cyclic behavior, the mechanism of the sensitivity list             ensures that the output, S, will be updated whenever A, or B, or both change.                 There are two kinds of procedural assignments: blocking and nonblocking. The two             are distinguished by their symbols and by their operation. Blocking assignments use the             equals symbol (=) as the assignment operator, and nonblocking assignments use the left             arrow (6 =) as the operator. Blocking assignment statements are executed sequentially             in the order that they are listed in a sequential block; when they execute, they have an             immediate effect on the contents of memory before the next statement can be executed.             Nonblocking assignments are made concurrently. This feature is implemented by evalu-             ating the expression on the right\\\\hand side of each statement in the list of statements             before making the assignment to their left\\\\hand sides. Consequently, there is no interac-             tion between the result of any assignment and the evaluation of an expression affecting             another assignment. Also, the statements associated with an edge\\\\sensitive cyclic behav-             ior do not execute until the indicated edge condition occurs. Consider (c) in the example             given above. In the list of blocking procedural assignment, the first statement transfers the             sum (RA + RB) to RA, and the second statement transfers the new value of RA into RD.             The value in RA after the clock event is the sum of the values in RA and RB immediately             before the clock event. At the completion of the operation, both RA and RD have the             same value. In the nonblocking procedural assignment ((d) above), the two assignments             are performed concurrently, so that RD receives the original value of RA. The activity             in both examples is launched by the clock undergoing a falling edge transition.                 The registers in a system are clocked simultaneously (concurrently). The D\\\\input of             each flip\\\\flop determines the value that will be assigned to its output, independently of             the input to any other flip\\\\flop. To ensure synchronous operations in RTL design, and             to ensure a match between an HDL model and the circuit synthesized from the model,             it is necessary that nonblocking procedural assignments be used for all variables that             are assigned a value within an edge\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior (always clocked). The non-             blocking assignment that appears in an edge\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior models the behav-             ior of the hardware of a synchronous sequential circuit accurately. In general, the             blocking assignment operator (=) is used in a procedural assignment statement only             when it is necessary to specify a sequential ordering of multiple assignment statements. HDL Operators             The Verilog HDL operators and their symbols used in RTL design are listed in Table 8.1.             The arithmetic, logic, and shift operators describe register transfer operations.

The operands of the arithmetic operators are numbers. The +, -, *, and / operators form the sum, difference, product, and quotient, respectively, of a pair of operands. The exponentiation operator (**) was added to the language in 2001 and forms a double\\\\precision floating\\\\point value from a base and exponent having a real, integer,                                         Section 8.3 Register Transfer Level in HDL 357 or signed value. Negative numbers are represented in 2s\\\\complement form. The mod- ulus operator produces the remainder from the division of two numbers. For example, 14 % 3 evaluates to 2.    There are two types of binary operators for binary words: bitwise and reduction. The bitwise operators perform a bit\\\\by\\\\bit operation on two vector operands to form a vec- tor result. They take each bit in one operand and perform the operation with the cor- responding bit in the other operand. Negation (~) is a unary operator; it complements the bits of a single vector operand to form a vector result. The reduction operators are also unary, acting on a single operand and producing a scalar (one\\\\bit) result. They oper- ate pairwise on the bits of a word, from right to left, and yield a one\\\\bit result. For example, the reduction NOR (~|) results in 0 with operand 00101 and in 1 with operand 00000. The result of applying the NOR operation on the first two bits is used with the third bit, and so forth. Negation is not used as a reduction operatorits operation on a vector produces a vector. Truth tables for the bitwise operators acting on a pair of scalar operands are the same as those listed in Table 4.9 in Section 4.12 for the corre- sponding Verilog primitive (e.g., the and primitive and the & bitwise operator have the same truth table). The output of an AND gate with two scalar inputs is the same as the result produced by operating on the two bits with the & operator.    The logical and relational operators are used to form Boolean expressions and can take variables or expressions as operands. (Note:A variable is also an expression.) Used basically for determining true or false conditions, the logical and relational operators evaluate to 1 if the condition expressed is true and to 0 if the condition is false. If the condition is ambiguous, they evaluate to x. An operand that is a variable evaluates to 0 if the value of the variable is equal to zero and to 1 if the value is not equal to zero. For example, if A = 1010 and B = 0000, then the expression A has the Boolean value 1 (the number in question is not equal to 0) and the expression B has the Boolean value 0. Results of other operations with these values are as follows: A && B = 0    // Logical AND:         (1010) && (0000) = 0 A & B = 0000  // Bitwise AND:         (1010) & (1010) = (0000) A || B = 1    // Logical OR:          (1010) || (0000) = 1 A | B = 1010  // Bitwise OR:          (1010) | (0000) = (1010) !A = 0        // Logical negation     !(1010) = !(1) = 0 ~A = 0101     // Bitwise negation     ~(1010) = (0101) !B = 1        // Logical negation     !(0000) = !(0) = 1 ~B = 1111     // Bitwise negation     ~(0000) = 1111 (A > B) = 1   // is greater than (A == B) = 0  // identity (equality) The relational operators = = = and ! = = test for bitwise equality (identity) and inequal- ity in Verilogs four\\\\valued logic system. For example, if A = 0xx0 and B = 0xx0, the test A = = = B would evaluate to true, but the test A = = B would evaluate to x.                 Verilog 2001 has logical and arithmetic shift operators.The logical shift operators shift             a vector operand to the right or the left by a specified number of bits. The vacated bit             positions are filled with zeros. For example, if R = 11010, then the statement                   R = R >> 1;             shifts R to the right one position. The value of R that results from the logical right\\\\shift             operation (11010) >> 1 is 01101. In contrast, the arithmetic right\\\\shift operator fills the             vacated cell (the most significant bit (MSB)) with its original contents when the word             is shifted to the right. The arithmetic left\\\\shift operator fills the vacated cell with a 0             when the word is shifted to the left. The arithmetic right\\\\shift operator is used when the             sign extension of a number is important. If R = 11010, then the statement                   R >>> 1;             produces the result R = 11101; if R = 01101, it produces the result R = 00110. There is             no distinction between the logical left\\\\shift and the arithmetic left\\\\shift operators.                 The concatenation operator provides a mechanism for appending multiple oper-             ands. It can be used to specify a shift, including the bits transferred into the vacant             positions. This aspect of its operation was shown in HDL Example 6.1 for the shift             register.                 Expressions are evaluated from left to right, and their operators associate from left             to right (with the exception of the conditional operator) according to the precedence             shown in Table 8.2. For example, in the expression A + B C C, the value of B is added             to A, and then C is subtracted from the result. In the expression A + B/C, the value of             B is divided by C, and then the result is added to A because the division operator ( / )             has a higher precedence than the addition operator (+). Use parentheses to establish             precedence. For example, the expression (A + B)/C is not the same as the expression             A + B/C. Loop Statements             Verilog HDL has four types of loops that execute procedural statements repeatedly:             repeat, forever, while, and for. All looping statements must appear inside an initial or             always block.                 The repeat loop executes the associated statements a specified number of times. The             following is an example that was used previously:                     initial                       begin                        clock = 1\\'b0;                        repeat (16)                          #5 clock = ~ clock;                       end             This code toggles the clock 16 times and produces eight clock cycles with a cycle time             of 10 time units. Section 8.3 Register Transfer Level in HDL 359 Table 8.2                             Highest precedence Verilog Operator Precedence           Lowest precedence    +  ! ~ & ~& | ~ | ^ ~^ ^~ (unary)    **    * / %    +  (binary)    << >> <<< >>>    < < = > >=    == != === !==    & (binary)    ^ ^~ ~^ (binary)    | (binary)    &&    ||    ?: (conditional operator)    { } { { } }    The forever loop causes unconditional, repetitive execution of a procedural statement or a block of procedural statements. For example, the following loop produces a con- tinuous clock having a cycle time of 20 time units:          initial           begin             clock = 1\\'b0;             forever              #10 clock = ~ clock;           end    The while loop executes a statement or a block of statements repeatedly while an expression is true. If the expression is false to begin with, the statement is never exe- cuted. The following example illustrates the use of the while loop:         integer count;          initial            begin             count = 0;             while (count < 64)               #5 count = count + 1;            end             The value of count is incremented from 0 to 63. Each increment is delayed by five time             units, and the loop exits at the count of 64.                 In dealing with looping statements, it is sometimes convenient to use the integer data             type to index the loop. Integers are declared with the keyword integer, as in the previous             example. Although it is possible to use a reg variable to index a loop, sometimes it is             more convenient to declare an integer variable, rather than a reg, for counting purposes.             Variables declared as data type reg are stored as unsigned numbers. Those declared as             data type integer are store as signed numbers in 2s\\\\complement format. The default             width of an integer is a minimum of 32 bits.                 The for loop is a compact way to express the operations implied by a list of state-             ments whose variables are indexed. The for loop contains three parts separated by two             semicolons:                   An initial condition.                   An expression to check for the terminating condition.                   An assignment to change the control variable.                 The following is an example of a for loop:                       for (j = 0; j < 8; j = j + 1)                        begin                          // procedural statements go here                        end             The for loop statement repeats the execution of the procedural statements eight times. The             control variable is j, the initial condition is j = 0, and the loop is repeated as long as j is less             than 8. After each execution of the loop statement, the value of j is incremented by 1.                 A description of a two\\\\to\\\\four\\\\line decoder using a for loop is shown in HDL Exam-             ple 8.1. Since output Y is evaluated in a procedural statement, it must be declared as             type reg. The control variable for the loop is the integer k. When the loop is expanded             (unrolled), we get the following four conditions (IN and Y are in binary, and the index             for Y is in decimal):                   if IN = 00 then Y(0) = 1; else Y(0) = 0;                   if IN = 01 then Y(1) = 1; else Y(1) = 0;                   if IN = 10 then Y(2) = 1; else Y(2) = 0;                   if IN = 11 then Y(3) = 1; else Y(3) = 0; HDL Example 8.1 (Decoder) // Description of 2 x 4 decoder using a for loop statement module decoder (IN, Y); input    [1: 0] IN;        // Two binary inputs output   [3: 0] Y;         // Four binary outputs reg      [3: 0] Y; integer  k;                // Control (index) variable for loop                                                     Section 8.3 Register Transfer Level in HDL 361                               always @ (IN)                                 for (k = 0; k <= 3; k = k + 1)                                 if (IN == k) Y[k] = 1;                                 else Y[k] = 0;                              endmodule Logic Synthesis             Logic synthesis is the automatic process by which a computer\\\\based program (i.e., a             synthesis tool) transforms an HDL model of a logic circuit into an optimized netlist of             gates that perform the operations specified by the source code. There are various target             technologies that implement the synthesized design in hardware. The effective use of             an HDL description requires that designers adopt a vendor\\\\specific style suitable for             the particular synthesis tools. The type of ICs that implement the design may be an             application\\\\specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable logic device (PLD), or             a field\\\\programmable gate array (FPGA). Logic synthesis is widely used in industry to             design and implement large circuits efficiently, correctly, and rapidly.                 Logic synthesis tools interpret the source code of the HDL and translate it into             an optimized gate structure, accomplishing (correctly) all of the work that would be             done by manual methods using Karnaugh maps. Designs written in Verilog or a compa-             rable language for the purpose of logic synthesis tend to be at the register transfer level.             This is because the HDL constructs used in an RTL description can be converted into             a gate\\\\level description in a straightforward manner. The following examples discuss             how a logic synthesizer can interpret an HDL construct and convert it into a gate             structure.                 The continuous assignment (assign) statement is used to describe combinational             circuits. In an HDL, it represents a Boolean equation for a logic circuit. A continuous             assignment with a Boolean expression for the right\\\\hand side of the assignment state-             ment is synthesized into the corresponding gate circuit implementing the expression.             An expression with an addition operator (+) is interpreted as a binary adder using             full\\\\adder circuits. An expression with a subtraction operator () is converted into a             gate\\\\level subtractor consisting of full adders and exclusive\\\\OR gates (Fig. 4.13).             A statement with a conditional operator such as                   assign Y = S ? In_1 : In_0;             translates into a two\\\\to\\\\one\\\\line multiplexer with control input S and data inputs In_1             and In_0.A statement with multiple conditional operators specifies a larger multiplexer.                 A cyclic behavior (always . . .) may imply a combinational or sequential circuit,             depending on whether the event control expression is level sensitive or edge sensitive.             A synthesis tool will interpret as combinational logic a level\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior             whose event control expression is sensitive to every variable that is referenced within             the behavior (e.g., by the variables appearing in the right\\\\hand side of an assignment statement). The event control expression in a description of combinational logic may not be sensitive to an edge of any signal. For example, always @ (In_1 or In_0 or S)  // Alternative: (In_1, In_0, S)  if (S) Y = In_1;  else Y = In_0; translates into a two\\\\to\\\\one\\\\line multiplexer. As an alternative, the case statement may be used to imply large multiplexers. The casex statement treats the logic values x and z as dont\\\\cares when they appear in either the case expression or a case item.    An edge\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior (e.g., always @ (posedge clock)) specifies a syn- chronous (clocked) sequential circuit. The implementation of the corresponding circuit consists of D flip\\\\flops and the gates that implement the synchronous register transfer operations specified by the statements associated with the event control expression. Examples of such circuits are registers and counters. A sequential circuit description with a case statement translates into a control circuit with D flip\\\\flops and gates that form the inputs to the flip\\\\flops. Thus, each statement in an RTL description is inter- preted by the synthesizer and assigned to a corresponding gate and flip\\\\flop circuit. For synthesizable sequential circuits, the event control expression must be sensitive to the positive or the negative edge of the clock (synchronizing signal), but not to both.    A simplified flowchart of the process used by industry to design digital systems is shown in Fig. 8.1. The RTL description of the HDL design is simulated and checked for proper operation. Its operational features must match those given in the specification for the behavior of the circuit. The test bench provides the stimulus signals to the simu- lator. If the result of the simulation is not satisfactory, the HDL description is corrected and checked again. After the simulation run shows a valid design, the RTL description is ready to be compiled by the logic synthesizer. All errors (syntax and functional) in the description must be eliminated before synthesis. The synthesis tool generates a netlist equivalent to a gate\\\\level description of the design as it is represented by the model. If the model fails to express the functionality of the specification, the circuit will fail to do so also. The gate\\\\level circuit is simulated with the same set of stimuli used to check the RTL design. If any corrections are needed, the process is repeated until a satisfactory simulation is achieved. The results of the two simulations are compared to see if they match. If they do not, the designer must change the RTL description to correct any errors in the design. Then the description is compiled again by the logic synthesizer to generate a new gate\\\\level description. Once the designer is satisfied with the results of all simulation tests, the design of the circuit is ready for physical implementation in a technology. In practice, additional testing will be performed to verify that the timing specifications of the circuit can be met in the chosen hardware technology. That issue is not within the scope of this text.    Logic synthesis provides several advantages to the designer. It takes less time to write an HDL description and synthesize a gate\\\\level realization than it does to develop the circuit by manual entry from schematic diagrams. The ease of changing the description facilitates exploration of design alternatives. It is faster, easier, less expensive, and less risky to check the validity of the design by simulation than it is to produce a hardware                      Section 8.4 Algorithmic State Machines (ASMs) 363                  Develop specification                   Develop/edit HDL                        description                  Simulate/verify HDL                        description                  No                                  Test bench                         Correct?

A schematic and the database for fabricating the integrated      circuit can be generated automatically by synthesis tools. The HDL model can be com-      piled by different tools into different technologies (e.g., ASIC cells or FPGAs), provid-      ing multiple returns on the investment to create the model. 8.4  ALGORITHMIC STATE MACHINES (ASMs)       The binary information stored in a digital system can be classified as either data or       control information. Data are discrete elements of information (binary words) that are       manipulated by performing arithmetic, logic, shift, and other similar data\\\\processing             operations. These operations are implemented with digital hardware components such             as adders, decoders, multiplexers, counters, and shift registers. Control information pro-             vides command signals that coordinate and execute the various operations in the data             section of the machine in order to accomplish the desired data\\\\processing tasks.                 The design of the logic of a digital system can be divided into two distinct efforts. One             part is concerned with designing the digital circuits that perform the data\\\\processing             operations. The other part is concerned with designing the control circuits that deter-             mine the sequence in which the various manipulations of data are performed.                 The relationship between the control logic and the data\\\\processing operations in a             digital system is shown in Fig. 8.2. The data\\\\processing path, commonly referred to as             the datapath unit, manipulates data in registers according to the systems requirements.             The control unit issues a sequence of commands to the datapath unit. Note that an             internal feedback path from the datapath unit to the control unit provides status condi-             tions that the control unit uses together with the external (primary) inputs to determine             the sequence of control signals (outputs of the control unit) that direct the operation             of the datapath unit. Well see later that understanding how to model this feedback             relationship with an HDL is very important.                 The control logic that generates the signals for sequencing the operations in the             datapath unit is a finite state machine (FSM), i.e., a synchronous sequential circuit. The             control commands for the system are produced by the FSM as functions of the primary             inputs, the status signals, and the state of the machine. In a given state, the outputs of             the controller are the inputs to the datapath unit and determine the operations that it             will execute. Depending on status conditions and other external inputs, the FSM goes             to its next state to initiate other operations. The digital circuits that act as the control             logic provide a time sequence of signals for initiating the operations in the datapath and             also determine the next state of the control subsystem itself.

An algorithm consists of a finite number of procedural steps that             specify how to obtain a solution to a problem. A hardware algorithm is a procedure for             solving the problem with a given piece of equipment. The most challenging and creative             part of digital design is the formulation of hardware algorithms for achieving required             objectives. The goal is to implement the algorithms in silicon as an integrated circuit.                 A flowchart is a convenient way to specify the sequence of procedural steps and deci-             sion paths for an algorithm. A flowchart for a hardware algorithm translates the verbal             instructions to an information diagram that enumerates the sequence of operations             together with the conditions necessary for their execution. An algorithmic state machine             (ASM) chart is a flowchart that has been developed to specifically define algorithms for             execution on digital hardware. A state machine is another term for a sequential circuit,             which is the basic structure of a digital system. ASM Chart             An ASM chart resembles a conventional flowchart, but is interpreted somewhat differ-             ently. A conventional flowchart describes the procedural steps and decision paths of an             algorithm in a sequential manner, without taking into consideration their time relation-             ship. The ASM chart describes the sequence of events, i.e., the ordering of events in time,             as well as the timing relationship between the states of a sequential controller and the             events that occur while going from one state to the next (i.e., the events that are syn-             chronous with changes in the state). The chart is adapted to specify accurately the con-             trol sequence and datapath operations in a digital system, taking into consideration the             constraints of digital hardware.                 An ASM chart is composed of three basic elements: the state box, the decision box,             and the conditional box. The boxes themselves are connected by directed edges indicat-             ing the sequential precedence and evolution of the states as the machine operates. There             are various ways to attach information to an ASM chart. In one, a state in the control             sequence is indicated by a state box, as shown in Fig. 8.3(a). The shape of the state box             is a rectangle within which are written register operations or the names of output signals             that the control generates while being in the indicated state. The state is given a symbolic             name, which is placed within the upper left corner of the box. The binary code assigned             to the state is placed at the upper right corner. (The state symbol and code can be placed                        Binary code                 0101 State name                           S_ pause Moore-type                               R0 output signals, register operations                                      Start_OP_A                      (a)             (b) FIGURE 8.3 ASM chart state box             in other places as well.) Figure 8.3(b) gives an example of a state box. The state has the             symbolic name S_pause, and the binary code assigned to it is 0101. Inside the box is writ-             ten the register operation R d 0, which indicates that register R is to be cleared to 0.The             name Start_OP_A inside the box indicates, for example, a Moore\\\\type output signal that             is asserted while the machine is in state S_pause and that launches a certain operation             in the datapath unit.                 The style of state box shown in Fig. 8.3(b) is sometimes used in ASM charts, but it can             lead to confusion about when the register operation R d 0 is to execute. Although the             operation is written inside the state box, it actually occurs when the machine makes a             transition from S_pause to its next state. In fact, writing the register operation within the             state box is a way (albeit possibly confusing) to indicate that the controller must assert             a signal that will cause the register operation to occur when the machine changes state.             Later well introduce a chart and notation that are more suited to digital design and that             will eliminate any ambiguity about the register operations controlled by a state machine.                 The decision box of an ASM chart describes the effect of an input (i.e., a primary, or             external, input or a status, or internal, signal) on the control subsystem. The box is dia-             mond shaped and has two or more exit paths, as shown in Fig. 8.4. The input condition             to be tested is written inside the box. One or the other exit path is taken, depending on             the evaluation of the condition. In the binary case, one path is taken if the condition is             true and another when the condition is false. When an input condition is assigned a             binary value, the two paths are indicated by 1 and 0, respectively.                 The state and decision boxes of an ASM chart are similar to those used in conven-             tional flowcharts. The third element, the conditional box, is unique to the ASM chart.             The shape of the conditional box is shown in Fig. 8.5(a). Its rounded corners differenti-             ate it from the state box. The input path to the conditional box must come from one of             the exit paths of a decision box. The outputs listed inside the conditional box are gener-             ated as Mealy\\\\type signals during a given state; the register operations listed in the             conditional box are associated with a transition from the state. Figure 8.5(b) shows an             example with a conditional box. The control generates the output signal Start while in             state S_1 and checks the status of input Flag. If Flag = 1, then R is cleared to 0; otherwise,             R remains unchanged. In either case, the next state is S_2. A register operation is                         1 Condition 3                         Exit path 2  Exit path                         Exit path FIGURE 8.4 ASM chart decision box                                    Section 8.4 Algorithmic State Machines (ASMs) 367                       Binary code      Reset_b                     Reset_b State name                                              001                       001 Moore-type output signals          S_1                       S_1 Unconditional register operations                               Start                     Start                                    0  Flag   1               0  Flag  1 Condition                                           R0                      Flush_R                   Conditional                           010                       010                 (Mealy) outputs    S_2                       S_2                   and register          F G                    Load_F_G                    operations                                                         100                       100                                    S_3                       S_3            (a)                          (b)                     (c) FIGURE 8.5 ASM chart conditional box and examples associated with S_2. We again note that this style of chart can be a source of confusion, because the state machine does not execute the indicated register operation R d 0 when it is in S_1 or the operation F d Gwhen it is in S_2. The notation actually indicates that when the controller is in S_1, it must assert a Mealy\\\\type signal that will cause the reg- ister operation R d 0 to execute in the datapath unit1, subject to the condition that Flag = 0. Likewise, in state S_2, the controller must generate a Moore\\\\type output signal that causes the register operation F d G to execute in the datapath unit. The operations in the datapath unit are synchronized to the clock edge that causes the state to move from S_1 to S_2 and from S_2 to S_3, respectively. Thus, the control signal generated in a given state affects the operation of a register in the datapath when the next clock transition occurs. The result of the operation is apparent in the next state.    The ASM chart in Fig. 8.5(b) mixes descriptions of the datapath and the controller. An ASM chart for only the controller is shown in Fig. 8.5(c), in which the register oper- ations are omitted. In their place are the control signals that must be generated by the control unit to launch the operations of the datapath unit. This chart is useful for describ- ing the controller, but it does not contain adequate information about the datapath. (Well address this issue later.) 1 If the path came from a state box the asserted signals would be moore type signals, dependent on only the state, and should be listed within the box. ASM Block             An ASM block is a structure consisting of one state box and all the decision and condi-             tional boxes connected to its exit path. An ASM block has one entrance and any number             of exit paths represented by the structure of the decision boxes. An ASM chart consists             of one or more interconnected blocks. An example of an ASM block is given in Fig. 8.6.             Associated with state S_0 are two decision boxes and one conditional box. The diagram             distinguishes the block with dashed lines around the entire structure, but this is not usu-             ally done, since the ASM chart uniquely defines each block from its structure. A state             box without any decision or conditional boxes constitutes a simple block.                 Each block in the ASM chart describes the state of the system during one clock\\\\pulse             interval (i.e., the interval between two successive active edges of the clock). The opera-             tions within the state and conditional boxes in Fig. 8.6(a) are initiated by a common             clock pulse when the state of the controller transitions from S_0 to its next state. The             same clock pulse transfers the system controller to one of the next states, S_1, S_2, or             S_3, as dictated by the binary values of E and F. The ASM chart for the controller alone             is shown in Fig. 8.6(b). The Moore\\\\type signal incr_A is asserted unconditionally while             the machine is in S_0; the Mealy\\\\type signal Clear_R is generated conditionally when             the state is S_0 and E is asserted. In general, the Moore\\\\type outputs of the controller             are generated unconditionally and are indicated within a state box; the Mealy\\\\type             outputs are generated conditionally and are indicated in the conditional boxes con-             nected to the edges that leave a decision box.                 The ASM chart is similar to a state transition diagram. Each state block is equivalent             to a state in a sequential circuit. The decision box is equivalent to the binary information                              Reset_b                                          Reset_b                                        001                                              001                          S_0                                              S_0                            A A1                                               incr_A                               E1                                                      1                                                                                E                  1                 R0                             1            Clear_B           F                                                F      010                 011                100       010                 011                100 S_1       S_2                 S_3                S_1       S_2                 S_3                     (a)                                              (b)      FIGURE 8.6      ASM blocks Section 8.4 Algorithmic State Machines (ASMs) 369         001 EF  00       E1 010  EF  01  100                                                                     011     FIGURE 8.7     State diagram equivalent to the ASM chart of Fig. 8.6 written along the directed lines that connect two states in a state diagram. As a conse- quence, it is sometimes convenient to convert the chart into a state diagram and then use sequential circuit procedures to design the control logic. As an illustration, the ASM chart of Fig. 8.6 is drawn as a state diagram (outputs are omitted) in Fig. 8.7. The states are symbolized by circles, with their binary values written inside. The directed lines indicate the conditions that determine the next state. The unconditional and conditional opera- tions that must be performed in the datapath unit are not indicated in the state diagram. Simplifications             A binary decision box of an ASM chart can be simplified by labeling only the edge cor-             responding to the asserted decision variable and leaving the other edge without a label.             A further simplification is to omit the edges corresponding to the state transitions that             occur when a reset condition is asserted. Output signals that are not asserted are not shown             on the chart; the presence of the name of an output signal indicates that it is asserted. Timing Considerations             The timing for all registers and flip\\\\flops in a digital system is controlled by a master\\\\             clock generator. The clock pulses are applied not only to the registers of the datapath,             but also to all the flip\\\\flops in the state machine implementing the control unit. Inputs             are also synchronized to the clock, because they are normally generated as outputs of             another circuit that uses the same clock signals. If the input signal changes at an arbitrary             time independently of the clock, we call it an asynchronous input. Asynchronous inputs             may cause a variety of problems. To simplify the design, we will assume that all inputs             are synchronized with the clock and change state in response to an edge transition.                 The major difference between a conventional flowchart and an ASM chart is in inter-             preting the time relationship among the various operations. For example, if Fig. 8.6 were             a conventional flowchart, then the operations listed would be considered to follow one             after another in sequence: First register A is incremented, and only then is E evaluated.             If E = 1, then register R is cleared and control goes to state S_3. Otherwise (if E = 0),             the next step is to evaluate F and go to state S_1 or S_2. In contrast, an ASM chart con-             siders the entire block as one unit. All the register operations that are specified within                                                    Clock Positive edge of Clock                            Present state        Next state                               ( S_0 )     (S_1 or S_2 or S_3) FIGURE 8.8 Transition between states the block must occur in synchronism at the edge transition of the same clock pulse while the system changes from S_0 to the next state. This sequence of events is presented pictorially in Fig. 8.8. In this illustration, we assume positive\\\\edge triggering of all flip\\\\ flops. An asserted asynchronous reset signal (reset_b) transfers the control circuit into state S_0. While in state S_0, the control circuits check inputs E and F and generate appropriate signals accordingly. If reset_b is not asserted, the following operations occur simultaneously at the next positive edge of the clock:    1. Register A is incremented.    2. If E = 1, register R is cleared.    3. Control transfers to the next state, as specified in Fig. 8.7. Note that the two operations in the datapath and the change of state in the control logic occur at the same time. Note also that the ASM chart in Fig. 8.6(a) indicates the register operations that must occur in the datapath unit, but does not indicate the control signal that is to be formed by the control unit. Conversely, the chart in Fig. 8.6(b) indicates the control signals, but not the datapath operations. We will now present an ASMD chart to provide the clarity and complete information needed by logic designers. ASMD Chart             Algorithmic state machine and datapath (ASMD) charts were developed to clarify the             information displayed by ASM charts and to provide an effective tool for designing a             control unit for a given datapath unit. An ASMD chart differs from an ASM chart in             three important ways: (1) An ASMD chart does not list register operations within a state             box, (2) the edges of an ASMD chart are annotated with register operations that are             concurrent with the state transition indicated by the edge, and (3) an ASMD chart             includes conditional boxes identifying the signals which control the register operations             that annotate the edges of the chart. Thus, an ASMD chart associates register operations             with state transitions rather than with states; it also associates register operations with the             signals that cause them. Consequently, an ASMD chart represents a partition of a com-             plex digital machine into its datapath and control units and clearly indicates the relation-             ship between them. There is no room for confusion about the timing of register             operations or about the signals that launch them.                 Designers form an ASMD chart in a three\\\\step process that creates an annotated and             completely specified ASM chart for the controller of a datapath unit.                                            Section 8.5 Design Example (ASMD Chart) 371         The steps to form an ASMD chart are:         1. Form an ASM chart showing only the states of the controller and the input signals2             that cause state transitions,         2. Convert the ASM chart into an ASMD chart by annotating the edges of the ASM             chart to indicate the concurrent register operations of the datapath unit (i.e., reg-             ister operations that are concurrent with a state transition), and         3. Modify the ASMD chart to identify the control signals that are generated by the             controller and that cause the indicated operations in the datapath unit.      The ASMD chart produced by this process clearly and completely specifies the finite      state machine of the controller, identifies the registers operations of the datapath unit,      identifies signals reporting the status of the datapath to the controller, and links register      operations to the signals that control them.         One important use of a state machine is to control register operations on a datapath      in a sequential machine that has been partitioned into a controller and a datapath. An      ASMD chart links the ASM chart of the controller to the datapath it controls in a man-      ner that serves as a universal model representing all synchronous digital hardware      design. ASMD charts help clarify the design of a sequential machine by separating the      design of its datapath from the design of the controller, while maintaining a clear rela-      tionship between the two units. Register operations that occur concurrently with state      transitions are annotated on a path of the chart, rather than in state boxes or in condi-      tional boxes on the path, because these registers are not part of the controller. The      outputs generated by the controller are the signals that control the registers of the      datapath and cause the register operations annotated on the ASMD chart. 8.5  DESIGN EXAMPLE (ASMD CHART)       We will now present a simple example demonstrating the use of the ASMD chart and       the register transfer representation. We start from the initial specifications of a system       and proceed with the development of an appropriate ASMD chart from which the       digital hardware is then designed.          The datapath unit is to consist of two JK flip\\\\flops E and F, and one four\\\\bit binary       counter A[3: 0].The individual flip\\\\flops in A are denoted by A3, A2, A1, and A0, with A3       holding the most significant bit of the count. A signal, Start, initiates the systems oper-       ation by clearing the counter A and flip\\\\flop F. At each subsequent clock pulse, the       counter is incremented by 1 until the operations stop. Counter bits A2 and A3 determine       the sequence of operations:              If A2 = 0, E is cleared to 0 and the count continues.              If A2 = 1, E is set to 1; then, if A3 = 0, the count continues, but if A3 = 1, F is set to              1 on the next clock pulse and the system stops counting.      2 In general, the inputs to the control unit are external (primary) inputs and status signals that originate in      the datapath unit.                     Then, if Start = 0, the system remains in the initial state, but if Start = 1, the operation                    cycle repeats.                 A block diagram of the systems architecture is shown in Fig. 8.9(a), with (1) the             registers of the datapath unit, (2) the external (primary) input signals, (3) the status             signals fed back from the datapath unit to the control unit, and (4) the control signals             generated by the control unit and input to the datapath unit. Note that the names of the             control signals clearly indicate the operations that they cause to be executed in the             datapath unit. For example, clr_A_F clears registers A and F. The name of the signal             reset_b (alternatively, reset_bar) indicates that the reset action is active low.The internal             details of each unit are not shown. ASMD Chart             An ASMD chart for the system is shown in Fig. 8.9(b) for asynchronous reset action and             in Fig. 8.9(c) for synchronous reset action. The chart shows the state transitions of the             controller and the datapath operations associated with those transitions. The chart is not             in its final form, for it does not identify the control signals generated by the controller.             The nonblocking Verilog operator (6=) is shown instead of the arrow ( d ) for register             transfer operations because we will ultimately use the ASMD chart to write a Verilog             description of the system.                 When the reset action is synchronous, the transition to the reset state is synchronous             with the clock. This transition is shown for S_idle in the diagram, but all other synchro-             nous reset paths are omitted for clarity.The system remains in the reset state, S_idle, until             Start is asserted. When that happens (i.e., Start = 1), the state moves to S_1. At the next             clock edge, depending on the values of A2 and A3 (decoded in a priority order), the state             returns to S_1 or goes to S_2. From S_2, it moves unconditionally to S_idle, where it             awaits another assertion of Start.                 The edges of the chart represent the state transitions that occur at the active (i.e.,             synchronizing) edge of the clock (e.g., the rising edge) and are annotated with the             register operations that are to occur in the datapath. With Start asserted in S_idle,             the state will transition to S_1 and the registers A and F will be cleared. Note that,             on the one hand, if a register operation is annotated on the edge leaving a state box,             the operation occurs unconditionally and will be controlled by a Moore\\\\type signal.             For example, register A is incremented at every clock edge that occurs while the             machine is in the state S_1. On the other hand, the register operation setting register             E annotates the edge leaving the decision box for A2. The signal controlling the             operation will be a Mealy\\\\type signal asserted when the system is in state S_1 and             A2 has the value 1. Likewise, the control signal clearing A and F is asserted condition-             ally: The system is in state S_idle and Start is asserted.                 In addition to showing that the counter is incremented in state S_1, the annotated             paths show that other operations occur conditionally with the same clock edge:                     Either E is cleared and control stays in state S_1 (A2 = 0) or                     E is set and control stays in state S_1 (A2A3 = 10) or                    E is set and control goes to state S_2 (A2A3 = 11).

The third and final step in creating the ASMD chart is to insert conditional boxes for             the signals generated by the controller or to insert Moore\\\\type signals in the state boxes,             as shown in Fig. 8.9(d). The signal clr_A_F is generated conditionally in state S_idle,             incr_A is generated unconditionally in S_1, clr_E and set_E are generated conditionally             in S_1, and set_F is generated unconditionally in S_2. The ASM chart has three states             and three blocks. The block associated with S_idle consists of the state box, one decision             box, and one conditional box. The block associated with S_2 consists of only the state             box. In addition to clock and reset_b, the control logic has one external input, Start, and             two status inputs, A2 and A3.                 In this example, we have shown how a verbal (text) description (specification) of a             design is translated into an ASMD chart that completely describes the controller for the             datapath, indicating the control signals and their associated register operations. This             design example does not necessarily have a practical application, and in general, depend-             ing on the interpretation, the ASMD chart produced by the three\\\\step design process             for the controller may be simplified and formulated differently. However, once the             ASMD chart is established, the procedure for designing the circuit is straightforward.             In practice, designers use the ASMD chart to write Verilog models of the controller and             the datapath and then synthesize a circuit directly from the Verilog description. We will             first design the system manually and then write the HDL description, keeping synthesis             as an optional step for those who have access to synthesis tools. Timing Sequence             Every block in an ASMD chart specifies the signals which control the operations that             are to be initiated by one common clock pulse. The control signals specified within the             state and conditional boxes in the block are formed while the controller is in the indi-             cated state, and the annotated operations occur in the datapath unit when the state             makes a transition along an edge that exits the state. The change from one state to the             next is performed in the control logic. In order to appreciate the timing relationship             involved, we will list the step\\\\by\\\\step sequence of operations after each clock edge,             beginning with an assertion of the signal Start until the system returns to the reset (ini-             tial) state, S_idle.                 Table 8.3 shows the binary values of the counter and the two flip\\\\flops after every             clock pulse. The table also shows separately the status of A2 and A3, as well as the pres-             ent state of the controller. We start with state S_1 right after the input signal Start has             caused the counter and flip\\\\flop F to be cleared. We will assume that the machine had             been running before it entered S_idle, instead of entering it from a reset condition.             Therefore, the value of E is assumed to be 1, because E is set to 1 when the machine             enters S_2, before moving to S_idle (as shown at the bottom of the table), and because             E does not change during the transition from S_idle to S_1. The system stays in state S_1             during the next 13 clock pulses. Each pulse increments the counter and either clears or             sets E. Note the relationship between the time at which A2 becomes a 1 and the time at              Section 8.5 Design Example (ASMD Chart) 375 Table 8.3 Sequence of Operations for Design Example Counter      Flip\\\\Flops A3 A2 A1 A0  E  F                          Conditions      State                                                             S_1 0 0 0 0      1  0                          A2 = 0, A3 = 0 0 0 0 1                                                     S_2 0 0 1 0      0  0                                          S_idle 0 0 1 1              0  0              0  0 0 1 0 0      0  0                          A2 = 1, A3 = 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0      1  0 0 1 1 1              1  0              1  0 1 0 0 0      1  0                          A2 = 0, A3 = 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0      0  0 1 0 1 1              0  0              0  0 1 1 0 0      0  0                          A2 = 1, A3 = 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1      1  0              1  1 which E is set to 1.When A = (A3 A2 A1 A0) 0011, the next (4th) clock pulse increments the counter to 0100, but that same clock edge sees the value of A2 as 0, so E remains cleared. The next (5th) pulse changes the counter from 0100 to 0101, and because A2 is equal to 1 before the clock pulse arrives, E is set to 1. Similarly, E is cleared to 0 not when the count goes from 0111 to 1000, but when it goes from 1000 to 1001, which is when A2 is 0 in the present value of the counter.    When the count reaches 1100, both A2 and A3 are equal to 1. The next clock edge increments A by 1, sets E to 1, and transfers control to state S_2. Control stays in S_2 for only one clock period. The clock edge associated with the path leaving S_2 sets flip\\\\ flop F to 1 and transfers control to state S_idle.The system stays in the initial state S_idle as long as Start is equal to 0.    From an observation of Table 8.3, it may seem that the operations performed on E are delayed by one clock pulse. This is the difference between an ASMD chart and a conventional flowchart. If Fig. 8.9(d) were a conventional flowchart, we would assume that A is first incremented and the incremented value would have been used to check the status of A2. The operations that are performed in the digital hardware, as specified by a block in the ASMD chart, occur during the same clock cycle and not in a sequence of operations following each other in time, as is the usual interpretation in a conven- tional flowchart. Thus, the value of A2 to be considered in the decision box is taken             from the value of the counter in the present state and before it is incremented. This is             because the decision box for E belongs with the same block as state S_1. The digital             circuits in the control unit generate the signals for all the operations specified in the             present block prior to the arrival of the next clock pulse. The next clock edge executes             all the operations in the registers and flip\\\\flops, including the flip\\\\flops in the controller             that determine the next state, using the present values of the output signals of the             controller. Thus, the signals that control the operations in the datapath unit are formed             in the controller in the clock cycle (control state) preceding the clock edge at which the             operations execute. Controller and Datapath Hardware Design             The ASMD chart provides all the information needed to design the digital systemthe             datapath and the controller. The actual boundary between the hardware of the control-             ler and that of the datapath can be arbitrary, but we advocate, first, that the datapath             unit contain only the hardware associated with its operations and the logic required,             perhaps, to form status signals used by the controller, and, second, that the control unit             contain all of the logic required to generate the signals that control the operations of             the datapath unit. The requirements for the design of the datapath are indicated by the             control signals inside the state and conditional boxes of the ASMD chart and are spec-             ified by the annotations of the edges indicating datapath operations. The control logic             is determined from the decision boxes and the required state transitions. The hardware             configuration of the datapath and controller is shown in Fig. 8.10.                 Note that the input signals of the control unit are the external (primary) inputs (Start,             reset_b, and clock) and the status signals from the datapath (A2 and A3). The status             signals provide information about the present condition of the datapath. This informa-             tion, together with the primary inputs and information about the present state of the             machine, is used to form the output of the controller and the value of the next state. The             outputs of the controller are inputs to the datapath and determine which operations will             be executed when the clock undergoes a transition. Note, also, that the state of the con-             trol unit is not an output of the control unit.                 The control subsystem is shown in Fig. 8.10 with only its inputs and outputs, with             names matching those of the ASMD chart. The detailed design of the controller is con-             sidered subsequently. The datapath unit consists of a four\\\\bit binary counter and two             JK flip\\\\flops. The counter is similar to the one shown in Fig. 6.12, except that additional             internal gates are required for the synchronous clear operation. The counter is incre-             mented with every clock pulse when the controller state is S_1. It is cleared only when             control is at state S_idle and Start is equal to 1. The logic for the signal clr_A_F will be             included in the controller and requires an AND gate to guarantee that both conditions             are present. Similarly, we can anticipate that the controller will use AND gates to form             signals set_E and clr_E. Depending on whether the controller is in state S_1 and whether             A2 is asserted, set_F controls flip\\\\flop F and is asserted unconditionally during state S_2.             Note that all flip\\\\flops and registers, including the flip\\\\flops in the control unit, use a             common clock.

The register opera-             tions and control information can be specified with an ASMD chart. It is convenient to             separate the control logic from the register operations of the datapath. The ASMD chart             provides this separation and a clear sequence of steps to design a controller for a data-             path. The control information and register transfer operations can also be represented             separately, as shown in Fig. 8.11. The state diagram specifies the control sequence, and             the register operations are represented by the register transfer notation introduced in Start  0                                A2  0            S_idle                                    S_1               A2A3  11  S_2                    Start  1                                    A2A3  10                                         (a) S_idle             S_1, clr_A_F:                     A  0, F   0 S_1                S_1, incr_A:                      A  A  1                                                         1                    if (A2  1) then set_E: E             0                                                         1                    if (A2  0) then clr_E: E S_2                S_idle, set_F:                    F                                    (b) FIGURE 8.11 Register transfer\\\\level description of design example             Section 8.2. The state transition and the signal controlling the register operation are             shown with the operation. This representation is an alternative to the representation of             the system described in the ASMD chart of Fig. 8.9(d). Only the ASMD chart is really             needed, but the state diagram for the controller is an alternative representation that is             useful in manual design. The information for the state diagram is taken directly from             the ASMD chart. The state names are specified in each state box. The conditions that             cause a change of state are specified inside the diamond\\\\shaped decision boxes of the             ASMD chart and are used to annotate the state diagram. The directed lines between             states and the condition associated with each follow the same path as in the ASMD             chart. The register transfer operations for each of the three states are listed following             the name of the state. They are taken from the state boxes or the annotated edges of the             ASMD chart. State Table             The state diagram can be converted into a state table from which the sequential circuit             of the controller can be designed. First, we must assign binary values to each state in the             ASMD chart. For n flip\\\\flops in the control sequential circuit, the ASMD chart can             accommodate up to 2n states. A chart with 3 or 4 states requires a sequential circuit with             two flip\\\\flops. With 5 to 8 states, there is a need for three flip\\\\flops. Each combination             of flip\\\\flop values represents a binary number for one of the states.                 A state table for a controller is a list of present states and inputs and their correspond-             ing next states and outputs. In most cases, there are many dont\\\\care input conditions                          Section 8.5 Design Example (ASMD Chart) 379 Table 8.4 State Table for the Controller of Fig. 8.10                 Present     Inputs                 Next   Outputs                  State                             State Present\\\\State                                            set_E                                                                  clr_E Symbol          G1 G0 Start A2 A3 G1 G0                                 set_F                                                                                clr_A_F                                                                                        incr_A S_idle          0 0      0                   X X 0 0 0 000 0 S_idle                 0 0      1                   X X 0 1 0 001 0  S_1  S_1            0 1      X                   0 X 0 1 0 100 1  S_1  S_2            0 1      X                   1  0  0  1 1 000 1                 0 1      X                   1  1  1  1 1 000 1                 1 1      X                   X X 0 0 0 010 0             that must be included, so it is advisable to arrange the state table to take those conditions             into consideration. We assign the following binary values to the three states: S_idle = 00,             S_1 = 01, and S_2 = 11. Binary state 10 is not used and will be treated as a dont\\\\care             condition. The state table corresponding to the state diagram is shown in Table 8.4. Two             flip\\\\flops are needed, and they are labeled G1 and G0. There are three inputs and five             outputs. The inputs are taken from the conditions in the decision boxes. The outputs             depend on the inputs and the present state of the control. Note that there is a row in the             table for each possible transition between states. Initial state 00 goes to state 01 or stays             in 00, depending on the value of input Start. The other two inputs are marked with             dont\\\\care Xs, as they do not determine the next state in this case. While the system is             in binary state 00 with Start = 1, the control unit provides an output labeled clr_A_F to             initiate the required register operations. The transition from binary state 01 depends on             inputs A2 and A3. The system goes to binary state 11 only if A2A3 = 11; otherwise, it             remains in binary state 01. Finally, binary state 11 goes to 00 independently of the input             variables. Control Logic             The procedure for designing a sequential circuit starting from a state table was pre-             sented in Chapter 5. If this procedure is applied to Table 8.4, we need to use five\\\\             variable maps to simplify the input equations. This is because there are five variables             listed under the present\\\\state and input columns of the table. Instead of using maps             to simplify the input equations, we can obtain them directly from the state table by             inspection. To design the sequential circuit of the controller with D flip\\\\flops, it is             necessary to go over the next\\\\state columns in the state table and derive all the             conditions that must set each flip\\\\flop to 1. From Table 8.4, we note that the next\\\\             state column of G1 has a single 1 in the fifth row. The D input of flip\\\\flop G1 must             be equal to 1 during present state S_1 when both inputs A2 and A3 are equal to 1.             This condition is expressed with the D flip\\\\flop input equation                                                           DG1 = S_1 A2A3             Similarly, the next\\\\state column of G0 has four 1s, and the condition for setting this             flip\\\\flop is                                                     DG0 = Start S_idle + S_1             To derive the five output functions, we can exploit the fact that binary state 10 is not             used, which simplifies the equation for clr_A_F and enables us to obtain the following             simplified set of output equations:                                                           set_E = S_1A2                                                           clr_E = S_1A2                                                            set_F = S_2                                                        clr_A_F = Start S_idle                                                         incr_A = S_1             The logic diagram showing the internal detail of the controller of Fig. 8.10 is drawn in             Fig. 8.12.

We are now in a position to incorporate these components into the description       of a specific design. As mentioned previously, a design can be described either at the       structural or behavioral level. Behavioral descriptions may be classified as being either       at the register transfer level or at an abstract algorithmic level. Consequently, we now       consider three levels of design: structural description, RTL description, and algorithmic\\\\       based behavioral description.          The structural description is the lowest and most detailed level. The digital system is       specified in terms of the physical components and their interconnection. The various       components may include gates, flip\\\\flops, and standard circuits such as multiplexers and       counters. The design is hierarchically decomposed into functional units, and each unit is       described by an HDL module. A top\\\\level module combines the entire system by instan-       tiating all the lower level modules. This style of description requires that the designer       have sufficient experience not only to understand the functionality of the system, but       also to implement it by selecting and connecting other functional elements.          The RTL description specifies the digital system in terms of the registers, the opera-       tions performed, and the control that sequences the operations. This type of description       simplifies the design process because it consists of procedural statements that determine       the relationship between the various operations of the design without reference to any       specific structure. The RTL description implies a certain hardware configuration among       the registers, allowing the designer to create a design that can be synthesized automati-       cally, rather than manually, into standard digital components.          The algorithmic\\\\based behavioral description is the most abstract level, describing       the function of the design in a procedural, algorithmic form similar to a programming       language. It does not provide any detail on how the design is to be implemented with       hardware. The algorithmic\\\\based behavioral description is most appropriate for simulat-       ing complex systems in order to verify design ideas and explore trade-offs. Descriptions       at this level are accessible to nontechnical users who understand programming lan-       guages. Some algorithms, however, might not be synthesizable.          We will now illustrate the RTL and structural descriptions by using the design exam-       ple of the previous section. The design example will serve as a model of coding style for       future examples and will exploit alternative syntax options supported by revisions to       the Verilog language. (An algorithmic\\\\based description is illustrated in Section 8.9.) RTL Description             The block diagram in Fig. 8.10 describes the design example. An HDL description of             the design example can be written as a single RTL description in a Verilog module or             as a top\\\\level module having instantiations of separate modules for the controller and             the datapath. The former option simply ignores the boundaries between the functional             units; the modules in the latter option establish the boundaries shown in Fig. 8.9(a) and             Fig. 8.10. We advocate the second option, because, in general, it distinguishes more             clearly between the controller and the datapath. This choice also allows one to easily             substitute alternative controllers for a given datapath (e.g., replace an RTL model by             a structural model). The RTL description of the design example is shown in HDL             Example 8.2. The description follows the ASMD chart of Fig. 8.9(d), which contains a             complete description of the controller, the datapath, and the interface between them             (i.e., the outputs of the controller and the status signals). Likewise, our description has             three modules: Design_Example_RTL, Controller_RTL, and Datapath_RTL. The             descriptions of the controller and the datapath units are taken directly from Fig. 8.9(d).             Design_Example_RTL declares the input and output ports of the module and instanti-             ates Controller_RTL and Datapath_RTL.At this stage of the description, it is important             to remember to declare A as a vector. Failure to do so will produce port mismatch errors             when the descriptions are compiled together. Note that the status signals A[2] and A[3],             but not A[0] and A[1], are passed to the controller. The primary (external) inputs to             the controller are Start, clock (to synchronize the system), and reset_b. The active\\\\low             input signal reset_b is needed to initialize the state of the controller to S_idle. Without             that signal, the controller could not be placed in a known initial state.                 The controller is described by three cyclic (always) behaviors. An edge\\\\sensitive             behavior updates the state at the positive edge of the clock, depending on whether a             reset condition is asserted. Two level\\\\sensitive behaviors describe the combinational             logic for the next state and the outputs of the controller, as specified by the ASMD             chart. Notice that the description includes default assignments to all of the outputs             (e.g., set_E = 0). This approach allows the code of the case logic to be simplified by             expressing only explicit assertions of the variables (i.e., values are assigned by excep-             tion). The approach also ensures that every path through the assignment logic assigns             a value to every variable. Thus, a synthesis tool will interpret the logic to be combina-             tional; failure to assign a value to every variable on every path of logic implies the             need for a transparent latch (memory) to implement the logic. Synthesis tools will             provide the latch, wasting silicon area.                 The three states of the controller are given symbolic names and are encoded into             binary values. Only three of the possible two\\\\bit patterns are used, so the case statement             for the next\\\\state logic includes a default assignment to handle the possibility that one             of the three assigned codes is not detected. The alternative is to allow the hardware to             make an arbitrary assignment to the next state (next_state = 2bx;). Also, the first state-             ment of the next\\\\state logic assigns next_state = S_idle to guarantee that the next state             is assigned in every thread of the logic. This is a precaution against accidentally forget-             ting to make an assignment to the next state in every thread of the logic, with the result             that the description implies the need for memory, which a synthesis tool will implement             with a transparent latch.                 The description of Datapath_RTL is written by testing for an assertion of each             control signal from Controller_RTL. The register transfer operations are displayed in                                 Section 8.6 HDL Description of Design Example 383 the ASMD chart (Fig. 8.9(d)). Note that nonblocking assignments are used (with symbol 6 =) for the register transfer operations. This ensures that the register opera- tions and state transitions are concurrent, a feature that is especially crucial during control state S_1. In this state, A is incremented by 1 and the value of A2 (A[2]) is checked to determine the operation to execute at register E at the next clock. To accomplish a valid synchronous design, it is necessary to ensure that A[2] is checked before A is incremented. If blocking assignments were used, one would have to place the two statements that check E first and the A statement that increments last. How- ever, by using nonblocking assignments, we accomplish the required synchronization without being concerned about the order in which the statements are listed. The counter A in Datapath_RTL is cleared synchronously because clr_A_F is synchro- nized to the clock.    The cyclic behaviors of the controller and the datapath interact in a chain reaction: At the active edge of the clock, the state and datapath registers are updated. A change in the state, a primary input, or a status input causes the level\\\\sensitive behaviors of the controller to update the value of the next state and the outputs. The updated values are used at the next active edge of the clock to determine the state transition and the updates of the datapath.    Note that the manual method of design developed (1) a block diagram (Fig. 8.9(a)) showing the interface between the datapath and the controller, (2) an ASMD chart for the system (Fig. 8.9(d)), (3) the logic equations for the inputs to the flip\\\\flops of the controller, and (4) a circuit that implements the controller (Fig. 8.12). In contrast, an RTL model describes the state transitions of the controller and the operations of the datapath as a step toward automatically synthesizing the circuit that implements them. The descriptions of the datapath and controller are derived directly from the ASMD chart in both cases. HDL Example 8.2 // RTL description of design example (see Fig. 8.11) module Design_Example_RTL (A, E, F, Start, clock, reset_b); // Specify ports of the top-level module of the design // See block diagram, Fig. 8.10 output [3: 0] A; output     E, F; input      Start, clock, reset_b; // Instantiate controller and datapath units Controller_RTL M0 (set_E, clr_E, set_F, clr_A_F, incr_A, A[2], A[3], Start, clock, reset_b); Datapath_RTL M1 (A, E, F, set_E, clr_E, set_F, clr_A_F, incr_A, clock); endmodule module Controller_RTL (set_E, clr_E, set_F, clr_A_F, incr_A, A2, A3, Start, clock, reset_b); output reg set_E, clr_E, set_F, clr_A_F, incr_A; input             Start, A2, A3, clock, reset_b; reg [1: 0]    state, next_state; parameter S_idle = 2\\'b00, S_1 = 2\\'b01, S_2 = 2\\'b11; // State codes always @ (posedge clock, negedge reset_b)      // State transitions (edge sensitive) if (reset_b == 0) state <= S_idle; else state <= next_state; // Code next-state logic directly from ASMD chart (Fig. 8.9d) always @ (state, Start, A2, A3) begin                // Next-state logic (level sensitive) next_state = S_idle; case (state) S_idle:               if (Start) next_state = S_1; else next_state = S_idle; S_1:                  if (A2 & A3) next_state = S_2; else next_state = S_1; S_2:                  next_state = S_idle; default:              next_state = S_idle; endcase end // Code output logic directly from ASMD chart (Fig. 8.9d) always @ (state, Start, A2) begin set_E = 0; // default assignments; assign by exception clr_E = 0; set_F = 0; clr_A_F = 0; incr_A = 0; case (state) S_idle:               if (Start) clr_A_F = 1; S_1:                  begin incr_A = 1; if (A2) set_E = 1; else clr_E = 1; end S_2:                  set_F = 1; endcase end endmodule module Datapath_RTL (A, E, F, set_E, clr_E, set_F, clr_A_F, incr_A, clock); output reg [3: 0] A;                           // register for counter output reg    E, F;                            // flags input         set_E, clr_E, set_F, clr_A_F, incr_A, clock; // Code register transfer operations directly from ASMD chart (Fig. 8.9(d)) always @ (posedge clock) begin if (set_E)                                     E <= 1; if (clr_E)                                     E <= 0; if (set_F)                                     F <= 1; if (clr_A_F)                                   begin A <= 0; F <= 0; end if (incr_A)                                    A <= A + 1; end endmodule                                             Section 8.6 HDL Description of Design Example 385 Testing the Design Description             The sequence of operations for the design example was investigated in the previous             section. Table 8.3 shows the values of E and F while register A is incremented. It is             instructive to devise a test that checks the circuit to verify the validity of the HDL             description. The test bench in HDL Example 8.3 provides such a module. (The procedure             for writing test benches is explained in Section 4.12.) The test module generates signals             for Start, clock, and reset_b, and checks the results obtained from registers A, E, and F.             Initially, the reset_b signal is set to 0 to initialize the controller, and Start and clock are             set to 0. At time t = 5, the reset_b signal is de\\\\asserted by setting it to 1, the Start input             is asserted by setting it to 1, and the clock is then repeated for 16 cycles. The $monitor             statement displays the values of A, E, and F every 10 ns. The output of the simulation is             listed in the example under the simulation log. Initially, at time t = 0, the values of the             registers are unknown, so they are marked with the symbol x. The first positive clock             transition, at time = 10, clears A and F, but does not affect E, so E is unknown at this             time. The rest of the table is identical to Table 8.3. Note that since Start is still equal to             1 at time = 160, the last entry in the table shows that A and F are cleared to 0, and E             does not change and remains at 1. This occurs during the second transition, from S_idle             to S_1.

Numerical values are shown in hexadecimal format. The results             are annotated to call attention to the relationship between a control signal and the             operation that it causes to execute. For example, the controller asserts set_E for one             clock cycle before the clock edge at which E is set to 1. Likewise, set_F asserts during             the clock cycle before the edge at which F is set to 1. Also, clr_A_F is formed in the             cycle before A and F are cleared. A more thorough verification of Design_Example_             RTL would confirm that the machine recovers from a reset on the fly (i.e., a reset that             is asserted randomly after the machine is operating). Note that the signals in the out-             put of the simulation have been listed in groups showing (1) clock and reset_b, (2) Start             and the status inputs, (3) the state, (4) the control signals, and (5) the datapath regis-             ters. It is strongly recommended that the state always be displayed, because this informa-             tion is essential for verifying that the machine is operating correctly and for debugging             its description when it is not. For the chosen binary state code, S_idle = 002 = 0H,             S_1= 012 = 1H, and S_2 = 112 = 3H. Structural Description             The RTL description of a design consists of procedural statements that determine the             functional behavior of the digital circuit. This type of description can be compiled by                 Section 8.6 HDL Description of Design Example 387 Name 0          50                                      100  150 clock reset_b Start A2 A3 state[1: 0]  0      1                                        30   1 clr_A_F      x0 1234567 89abc                                d    0 set_E clr_E set_F incr_A A[3: 0] E F              FIGURE 8.13              Simulation results for Design_Example_RTL        HDL synthesis tools, from which it is possible to obtain the equivalent gate\\\\level circuit        of the design. It is also possible to describe the design by its structure rather than its        function. A structural description of a design consists of instantiations of components        that define the circuit elements and their interconnections. In this regard, a structural        description is equivalent to a schematic diagram or a block diagram of the circuit. Con-        temporary design practice relies heavily on RTL descriptions, but we will present a        structural description here to contrast the two approaches.           For convenience, the circuit is again decomposed into two parts: the controller and        the datapath. The block diagram of Fig. 8.10 shows the high\\\\level partition between these        units, and Fig. 8.12 provides additional underlying structural details of the controller.        The structure of the datapath is evident in Fig. 8.10 and consists of the flip\\\\flops and the        four\\\\bit counter with synchronous clear. The top level of the Verilog description replaces        Design_Example_RTL, Controller_RTL, and Datapath_RTL by Design_Example_STR,        Controller_STR, and Datapath_STR, respectively. The descriptions of Controller_STR        and Datapath_STR will be structural.           HDL Example 8.4 presents the structural description of the design example. It consists        of a nested hierarchy of modules and gates describing (1) the top\\\\level module, Design_        Example_STR, (2) the modules describing the controller and the datapath, (3) the modules        describing the flip\\\\flops and counters, and (4) gates implementing the logic of the controller.        For simplicity, the counter and flip\\\\flops are described by RTL models.           The top\\\\level module (see Fig. 8.10) encapsulates the entire design by (1) instantiating        the controller and the datapath modules, (2) declaring the primary (external) input signals,             (3) declaring the output signals, (4) declaring the control signals generated by the controller             and connected to the datapath unit, and (5) declaring the status signals generated by the             datapath unit and connected to the controller. The port list is identical to the list used in the             RTL description. The outputs are declared as wire type here because they serve merely to             connect the outputs of the datapath module to the outputs of the top\\\\level module, with             their logic value being determined within the datapath module.                 The control module describes the circuit of Fig. 8.12.The outputs of the two flip\\\\flops             G1 and G0 are declared as wire data type. G1 and G0 cannot be declared as reg data             type because they are outputs of an instantiated D flip\\\\flop. DG1 and DG0 are unde-             clared identifiers, i.e., implicit wires. The name of a variable is local to the module or             procedural block in which it is declared. Nets may not be declared within a procedural             block (e.g., begin . . . end). The rule to remember is that a variable must be a declared             register type (e.g., reg) if and only if its value is assigned by a procedural statement             (i.e., a blocking or nonblocking assignment statement within a procedural block in cyclic             or single\\\\pass behavior or in the output of a sequential UDP). The instantiated gates             specify the combinational part of the circuit. There are two flip\\\\flop input equations and             three output equations. The outputs of the flip\\\\flops G1 and G0 and the input equations             DG1 and DG0 replace output Q and input D in the instantiated flip\\\\flops. The D flip\\\\             flop is then described in the next module. The structure of the datapath unit has direct             inputs to the JK flip\\\\flops. Note the correspondence between the modules of the HDL             description and the structures in Figs. 8.9, 8.10, and 8.12.

The simulation results for Design_Example_STR matched those for Design_Example_ RTL. However, a comparison of the two descriptions indicates that the RTL style is easier                                                 Section 8.7 Sequential Binary Multiplier 391      to write and will lead to results faster if synthesis tools are available to automatically      synthesize the registers, the combinational logic, and their interconnections. 8.7  SEQUENTIAL BINARY MULTIPLIER      This section introduces a second design example. It presents a hardware algorithm for      binary multiplication, proposes the register configuration for its implementation, and      then shows how to use an ASMD chart to design its datapath and its controller.         The system we will examine multiplies two unsigned binary numbers. The hardware      developed in Section 4.7 to execute multiplication resulted in a combinational circuit      multiplier with many adders and AND gates, and requires large area of silicon as an      integrated circuit. In contrast, in this section, a more efficient hardware algorithm results      in a sequential multiplier that uses only one adder and a shift register. The savings in      hardware and silicon area come about from a trade\\\\off in the space (hardware)Ctime      domain. A parallel adder uses more hardware, but forms its result in one cycle of the      clock; a sequential adder uses less hardware, but takes multiple clock cycles to form its      result.         The multiplication of two binary numbers is done with paper and pencil by successive      (i.e., sequential) additions and shifting. The process is best illustrated with a numerical      example. Let us multiply the two binary numbers 10111 and 10011:      23  10111 multiplican      19  10011 multiplier          10111          10111          00000          00000          10111      437 110110101 product      The process consists of successively adding and shifting copies of the multiplicand.      Successive bits of the multiplier are examined, least significant bit first. If the multi-      plier bit is 1, the multiplicand is copied down; otherwise, 0s are copied down. The      numbers copied in successive lines are shifted one position to the left from the previ-      ous number. Finally, the numbers are added and their sum forms the product. The      product obtained from the multiplication of two binary numbers of n bits each can      have up to 2n bits. It is apparent that the operations of addition and shifting are      executed by the algorithm.         When the multiplication process is implemented with digital hardware, it is conve-      nient to change the process slightly. First, we note that, in the context of synthesizing      a sequential machine, the add\\\\and\\\\shift algorithm for binary multiplication can be      executed in a single clock cycle or over multiple clock cycles. A choice to form the             product in the time span of a single clock cycle will synthesize the circuit of a parallel             multiplier like the one discussed in Section 4.7. On the other hand, an RTL model of             the algorithm adds shifted copies of the multiplicand to an accumulated partial prod-             uct. The values of the multiplier, multiplicand, and partial product are stored in regis-             ters, and the operations of shifting and adding their contents are executed under the             control of a state machine. Among the many possibilities for distributing the effort of             multiplication over multiple clock cycles, we will consider that in which only one par-             tial product is formed and accumulated in a single cycle of the clock. (One alternative             would be to use additional hardware to form and accumulate two partial products in             a clock cycle, but this would require more logic gates and either faster circuits or a             slower clock.) Instead of providing digital circuits to store and add simultaneously as             many binary numbers as there are 1s in the multiplier, it is less expensive to provide             only the hardware needed to sum two binary numbers and accumulate the partial             products in a register. Second, instead of shifting the multiplicand to the left, the par-             tial product being formed is shifted to the right. This leaves the partial product and             the multiplicand in the required relative positions. Third, when the corresponding bit             of the multiplier is 0, there is no need to add all 0s to the partial product, since doing             so will not alter its resulting value. Register Configuration             A block diagram for the sequential binary multiplier is shown in Fig. 8.14(a), and the             register configuration of the datapath is shown in Fig. 8.14(b). The multiplicand is             stored in register B, the multiplier is stored in register Q, and the partial product is             formed in register A and stored in A and Q. A parallel adder adds the contents of             register B to register A. The C flip\\\\flop stores the carry after the addition. The counter             P is initially set to hold a binary number equal to the number of bits in the multiplier.             This counter is decremented after the formation of each partial product. When the             content of the counter reaches zero, the product is formed in the double register A             and Q, and the process stops. The control logic stays in an initial state until Start             becomes 1. The system then performs the multiplication. The sum of A and B forms             the n most significant bits of the partial product, which is transferred to A. The output             carry from the addition, whether 0 or 1, is transferred to C. Both the partial product             in A and the multiplier in Q are shifted to the right. The least significant bit of A is             shifted into the most significant position of Q, the carry from C is shifted into the most             significant position of A, and 0 is shifted into C. After the shift\\\\right operation, one             bit of the partial product is transferred into Q while the multiplier bits in Q are shifted             one position to the right. In this manner, the least significant bit of register Q, desig-             nated by Q[0], holds the bit of the multiplier that must be inspected next. The control             logic determines whether to add or not on the basis of this input bit. The control logic             also receives a signal, Zero, from a circuit that checks counter P for zero. Q[0] and             Zero are status inputs for the control unit. The input signal Start is an external control             input. The outputs of the control logic launch the required operations in the registers             of the datapath unit.

The control signals govern the synchronous register operations of the datapath. Signal Load_regs loads the internal registers of the datapath, Shift_regs causes the shift register to shift, Add_regs forms the sum of the multiplicand and register A, and Decr_P decrements the counter. The controller also forms output Ready to signal to the host environment that the machine is ready to mul- tiply. The contents of the register holding the product vary during execution, so it is useful to have a signal indicating that its contents are valid. Note, again, that the state of the control is not an interface signal between the control unit and the datapath. Only the signals needed to control the datapath are included in the interface. Putting the state in the interface would require a decoder in the datapath, and would require a wider and more active bus than the control signals alone. Not good. ASMD Chart             The ASMD chart for the binary multiplier is shown in Fig. 8.15. The intermediate form             in Fig. 8.15(a) annotates the ASM chart of the controller with the register operations,             and the completed chart in Fig. 8.15(b) identifies the Moore and Mealy outputs of the             controller. Initially, the multiplicand is in B and the multiplier in Q.As long as the circuit             is in the initial state and Start = 0, no action occurs and the system remains in state S_idle             with Ready asserted. The multiplication process is launched when Start = 1.

In state S_add, the multiplier bit in Q[0] is checked, and if it is equal to 1, the multiplicand in B is added to the partial product in A. The carry from the addition is transferred to C. The partial product in A and C is left unchanged if Q[0] = 0. The coun- ter P is decremented by 1 regardless of the value of Q[0], so Decr_P is formed in state S_add as a Moore output of the controller. In both cases, the next state is S_shift. Reg- isters C, A, and Q are combined into one composite register CAQ, denoted by the concatenation {C, A, Q}, and its contents are shifted once to the right to obtain a new partial product. This shift operation is symbolized in the flowchart with the Verilog logical right\\\\shift operator, 77. It is equivalent to the following statement in register transfer notation:                                          Shift right CAQ, C d 0 In terms of individual register symbols, the shift operation can be described by the fol- lowing register operations:                                          A d shr A, An-1 d C                                          Q d shr Q, Qn-1 d A0                                                     Cd0 Both registers A and Q are shifted right. The leftmost bit of A, designated by An-1, receives the carry from C.The leftmost bit of Q, Qn-1, receives the bit from the rightmost position of A in A0, and C is reset to 0. In essence, this is a long shift of the composite register CAQ with 0 inserted into the serial input, which is at C.    The value in counter P is checked after the formation of each partial product. If the contents of P are different from zero, status bit Zero is set equal to 0 and the process is repeated to form a new partial product. The process stops when the counter reaches 0 and the controllers status input Zero is equal to 1. Note that the partial product formed in A is shifted into Q one bit at a time and eventually replaces the multiplier. The final product is available in A and Q, with A holding the most significant bits and Q the least significant bits of the product.    The previous numerical example is repeated in Table 8.5 to clarify the multiplication process. The procedure follows the steps outlined in the ASMD chart. The data shown in the table can be compared with simulation results.    The type of registers needed for the data processor subsystem can be derived from the register operations listed in the ASMD chart. Register A is a shift register with parallel load to accept the sum from the adder and must have a synchronous clear capability to reset the register to 0. Register Q is a shift register. The counter P is a binary down coun- ter with a facility to parallel load a binary constant. The C flip\\\\flop must be designed to accept the input carry and have a synchronous clear. Registers B and Q need a parallel load capability in order to receive the multiplicand and multiplier prior to the start of the multiplication process.

The control logic is a finite state machine; its Mealy\\\\ and Moore\\\\type outputs       control the operations of the datapath. The inputs to the control unit are the primary       (external) inputs and the internal status signals fed back from the datapath to the       controller. The design of the system can be synthesized from an RTL description       derived from the ASMD chart. Alternatively, a manual design must derive the logic       governing the inputs to the flip\\\\flops holding the state of the controller. The informa-       tion needed to form the state diagram of the controller is already contained in the       ASMD chart, since the rectangular blocks that designate state boxes are the states       of the sequential circuit. The diamond\\\\shaped blocks that designate decision boxes       determine the logical conditions for the next state transition in the state diagram and       assertions of the conditional outputs.          As an example, the control state diagram for the binary multiplier developed in the       previous section is shown in Fig. 8.16(a).The information for the diagram is taken directly       from the ASMD chart of Fig. 8.15. The three states S_idle through S_shift are taken from       the rectangular state boxes. The inputs Start and Zero are taken from the diamond\\\\       shaped decision boxes. The register transfer operations for each of the three states are       listed in Fig. 8.16(b) and are taken from the corresponding state and conditional boxes       in the ASMD chart. Establishing the state transitions is the initial focus, so the outputs       of the controller are not shown.

The sequence of states is specified in the ASMD chart or the state diagram. The signals for controlling the operations in the registers are specified in the register transfer state- ments annotated on the ASMD chart or listed in tabular format. For the multiplier, these signals are Load_regs (for parallel loading the registers in the datapath unit), Decr_P (for decrementing the counter), Add_regs (for adding the multiplicand and the partial product), and Shift_regs (for shifting register CAQ). The block diagram of the control unit is shown in Fig. 8.14(a). The inputs to the controller are Start, Q[0], and Zero, and the outputs are Ready, Load_regs, Decr_P, Add_regs, and Shift_regs, as specified in the ASMD chart. We note that Q[0] affects only the output of the controller, not its state transitions. The machine transitions from S_add to S_shift unconditionally.    An important step in the design is the assignment of coded binary values to the states. The simplest assignment is the sequence of binary numbers, as shown in Table 8.6. Another assignment is the Gray code, according to which only one bit changes when going from one number to the next. A state assignment often used in control design is the one\\\\hot assignment. This assignment uses as many bits and flip\\\\flops as there are states in the circuit. At any given time, only one bit is equal to 1 (the one that is hot) Table 8.6 State Assignment for Control State    Binary               Gray Code              One\\\\Hot S_idle   00                         00                  001                                     01                   010 S_add    01                         11                   100 S_shift  10             while all others are kept at 0 (all cold). This type of assignment uses a flip\\\\flop for each             state. Indeed, one\\\\hot encoding uses more flip\\\\flops than other types of coding, but it             usually leads to simpler decoding logic for the next state and the output of the machine.             Because the decoding logic does not become more complex as states are added to the             machine, the speed at which the machine can operate is not limited by the time required             to decode the state.                 Since the controller is a sequential circuit, it can be designed manually by the sequential             logic procedure outlined in Chapter 5. However, in most cases this method is difficult to             carry out manually because of the large number of states and inputs that a typical control             circuit may have. As a consequence, it is necessary to use specialized methods for control             logic design that may be considered as variations of the classical sequential logic method.             We will now present two such design procedures. One uses a sequence register and decoder,             and the other uses one flip\\\\flop per state. The method will be presented for a small circuit,             but it applies to larger circuits as well. Of course, the need for these methods is eliminated             if one has software that automatically synthesizes the circuit from an HDL description. Sequence Register and Decoder             The sequence\\\\register\\\\and\\\\decoder (manual) method, as the name implies, uses a reg-             ister for the control states and a decoder to provide an output corresponding to each of             the states. (The decoder is not needed if a one\\\\hot code is used.) A register with n flip\\\\             flops can have up to 2n states, and an n\\\\to\\\\2n\\\\line decoder has up to 2n outputs. An n\\\\bit             sequence register is essentially a circuit with n flip\\\\flops, together with the associated             gates that effect their state transitions.                 The ASMD chart and the state diagram for the controller of the binary multiplier             have three states and two inputs. (There is no need to consider Q[0].) To implement the             design with a sequence register and decoder, we need two flip\\\\flops for the register and             a two\\\\to\\\\four\\\\line decoder. The outputs of the decoder will form the Moore\\\\type outputs             of the controller directly. The Mealy\\\\type outputs will be formed from the Moore outputs             and the inputs.                 The state table for the finite state machine of the controller is shown in Table 8.7. It             is derived directly from the ASMD chart of Fig. 8.15(b) or the state diagram of             Fig. 8.16(a). We designate the two flip\\\\flops as G1 and G0 and assign the binary states             00, 01, and 10 to S_idle, S_add, and S_shift, respectively. Note that the input columns             have dont\\\\care entries whenever the input variable is not used to determine the next Table 8.7                             Inputs        Section 8.8 Control Logic 399 State Table for Control Circuit                                                     Next                           Present                   State                             State Present\\\\State                                      Ready                                                             Load_regs Symbol          G1 G0 Start Q[0] Zero G1 G0                          Decr_P                                                                              Add_regs                                                                                        Shift_regs S_idle          0 0                0  X       X  0  0 1000  0 S_idle S_add           0 0                1  X       X  0  1 1100  0 S_add S_shift         0 1                X  0       X  1  0 0010  0 S_shift                 0 1                X  1       X  1  0 0011  0                 1 0                X  X       0  0  1 0000  1                 1 0                X  X       1  0  0 0000  1 state. The outputs of the control circuit are designated by the names given in the ASMD chart. The particular Moore\\\\type output variable that is equal to 1 at any given time is determined from the equivalent binary value of the present state. Those output variables are shaded in Table 8.7. Thus, when the present state is G1G0 = 00, output Ready must be equal to 1, while the other outputs remain at 0. Since the Moore\\\\type outputs are a function of only the present state, they can be generated with a decoder circuit having the two inputs G1 and G0 and using three of the decoder outputs T0 through T2, as shown in Fig. 8.17(a), which does not include the wiring for the state feedback.    The state machine of the controller can be designed from the state table by means of the classical procedure presented in Chapter 5. This example has a small number of states and inputs, so we could use maps to simplify the Boolean functions. In most control logic applications, the number of states and inputs is much larger. In general, the application of the classical method requires an excessive amount of work to obtain the simplified input equations for the flip\\\\flops and is prone to error. The design can be simplified if we take into consideration the fact that the decoder outputs are available for use in the design. Instead of using flip\\\\flop outputs as the present\\\\state conditions, we use the outputs of the decoder to indicate the present\\\\state condition of the sequential circuit. Moreover, instead of using maps to simplify the flip\\\\flop equations, we can obtain them directly by inspection of the state table. For example, from the next\\\\state conditions in the state table, we find that the next state of G1 is equal to 1 when the present state is S_add and is equal to 0 when the present state is S_idle or S_shift. These conditions can be specified by the equation                                                  DG1 = T1 where DG1 is the D input of flip\\\\flop G1. Similarly, the D input of G0 is                                       DG0 = T0 Start + T2 Zero Start     Next State  D        G0                                                 Ready Q[0]        Logic        C                 (S_Idle) T0                       Load_regs Zero                       D               0                                      Add_regs                          C                  24                                 Decr_P                                           Decoder                            Shift_regs                                            (S_add) T1                                                             1 (S_shift) T2                                G1                              T3   clock                                                (a) reset_b   Next State Logic    Start              D            G0                          (S_idle) T0       Ready    Q[0]                                                                      Load_regs                             C                               0   Zero                                                                        Add_regs                                                                (S_add) T1       Decr_P                                                             2  4 Decoder      Shift_regs                                                                (S_shift) T2                                                             1                       D G1 T3                          C   clock                                                           (b) reset_b           FIGURE 8.17 400       Logic diagram of control for binary multiplier using a sequence register and decoder                                                                             Section 8.8 Control Logic 401                 When deriving input equations by inspection from the state table, we cannot be sure             that the Boolean functions have been simplified in the best possible way. (Synthesis tools             take care of this detail automatically.) In general, it is advisable to analyze the circuit to             ensure that the equations derived do indeed produce the required state transitions.                 The logic diagram of the control circuit is drawn in Fig. 8.17(b). It consists of a register             with two flip\\\\flops G1 and G0 and a 2 * 4 decoder. The outputs of the decoder are used to             generate the inputs to the next\\\\state logic as well as the control outputs. The outputs of the             controller should be connected to the datapath to activate the required register operations. One\\\\Hot Design (One Flip\\\\Flop per State)             Another method of control logic design is the one\\\\hot assignment, which results in a             sequential circuit with one flip\\\\flop per state. Only one of the flip\\\\flops contains a 1 at             any time; all others are reset to 0. The single 1 propagates from one flip\\\\flop to another             under the control of decision logic. In such a configuration, each flip\\\\flop represents a             state that is present only when the control bit is transferred to it.                 This method uses the maximum number of flip\\\\flops for the sequential circuit. For             example, a sequential circuit with 12 states requires a minimum of four flip\\\\flops. By             contrast, with the method of one flip\\\\flop per state, the circuit requires 12 flip\\\\flops, one             for each state. At first glance, it may seem that this method would increase system cost,             since more flip\\\\flops are used. But the method offers some advantages that may not be             apparent. One advantage is the simplicity with which the logic can be designed by             inspection of the ASMD chart or the state diagram. No state or excitation tables are             needed if D\\\\type flip\\\\flops are employed.The one\\\\hot method offers a savings in design             effort, an increase in operational simplicity, and a possible decrease in the total number             of gates, since a decoder is not needed.                 The design procedure for a one\\\\hot state assignment will be demonstrated by obtaining             the control circuit specified by the state diagram of Fig. 8.16(a). Since there are three states             in the state diagram, we choose three D flip\\\\flops and label their outputs G0, G1, and G2,             corresponding to S_idle, S_add, and S_shift, respectively. The input equations for setting             each flip\\\\flop to 1 are determined from the present state and the input conditions along             the corresponding directed lines going into the state. For example, DG0, the input to flip\\\\             flop G0, is set to 1 if the machine is in state G0 and Start is not asserted, or if the machine             is in state G2 and Zero is asserted. These conditions are specified by the input equation:                                                   DG0 = G0 Start + G2 Zero             In fact, the condition for setting a flip\\\\flop to 1 is obtained directly from the state dia-             gram, from the condition specified in the directed lines going into the corresponding             flip\\\\flop state ANDed with the previous flip\\\\flop state. If there is more than one directed             line going into a state, all conditions must be ORed. Using this procedure for the other             three flip\\\\flops, we obtain the remaining input equations:                                                   DG1 = G0 Start + G2 Zero                                                   DG2 = G1      Start                                         D Set               Ready                                                     (S_idle) G0   Load_regs      Q[0]      Zero                                             C            Add_regs                                                                      Decr_P                                                    D        G1                                                    (S_add)                                                       C                                                       Rst                                                    D              Shift_regs                                                     (S_shift) G2        clock                                           C      reset_b                                                         Rst       FIGURE 8.18       Logic diagram for one\\\\hot state controller         The logic diagram of the one\\\\hot controller (with one flip\\\\flop per state) is shown in      Fig. 8.18. The circuit consists of three D flip\\\\flops labeled G0 through G2, together with the      associated gates specified by the input equations. Initially, flip\\\\flop G0 must be set to 1 and      all other flip\\\\flops must be reset to 0, so that the flip\\\\flop representing the initial state is      enabled.This can be done by using an asynchronous preset on flip\\\\flop G0 and an asynchro-      nous clear for the other flip\\\\flops. Once started, the controller with one flip\\\\flop per state      will propagate from one state to the other in the proper manner. Only one flip\\\\flop will be      set to 1 with each clock edge; all others are reset to 0, because their D inputs are equal to 0. 8.9  HDL DESCRIPTION OF BINARY MULTIPLIER       A second example of an HDL description of an RTL design is given in HDL Example 8.5,       the binary multiplier designed in Section 8.7. For simplicity, the entire description is flat-       tened and encapsulated in one module. Comments will identify the controller and the       datapath. The first part of the description declares all of the inputs and outputs as specified                               Section 8.9 HDL Description of Binary Multiplier 403 in the block diagram of Fig. 8.14(a).The machine will be parameterized for a five\\\\bit data- path to enable a comparison between its simulation data and the result of the multiplication with the numerical example listed in Table 8.5.The same model can be used for a datapath having a different size merely by changing the value of the parameters. The second part of the description declares all registers in the controller and the datapath, as well as the one\\\\ hot encoding of the states. The third part specifies implicit combinational logic (continuous assignment statements) for the concatenated register CAQ, the Zero status signal, and the Ready output signal. The continuous assignments for Zero and Ready are accomplished by assigning a Boolean expression to their wire declarations. The next section describes the control unit, using a single edge\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior to describe the state transitions, and a level\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior to describe the combinational logic for the next state and the outputs. Again, note that default assignments are made to next_state, Load_regs, Decr_P, Add_regs, and Shift_regs.The subsequent logic of the case statement assigns their value by exception. The state transitions and the output logic are written directly from the ASMD chart of Fig. 8.15(b).    The datapath unit describes the register operations within a separate edge\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior.3 (For clarity, separate cyclic behaviors are used; we do not mix the description of the datapath with the description of the controller.) Each control input is decoded and is used to specify the associated operations. The addition and subtraction operations will be implemented in hardware by combinational logic. Signal Load_regs causes the counter and the other registers to be loaded with their initial values, etc. Because the controller and datapath have been partitioned into separate units, the con- trol signals completely specify the behavior of the datapath; explicit information about the state of the controller is not needed and is not made available to the datapath unit.    The next\\\\state logic of the controller includes a default case item to direct a synthesis tool to map any of the unused codes to S_idle. The default case item and the default assignments preceding the case statement ensure that the machine will recover if it somehow enters an unused state. They also prevent unintentional synthesis of latches. (Remember, a synthesis tool will synthesize latches when what was intended to be com- binational logic in fact fails to completely specify the inputCoutput function of the logic.)

The inputs and outputs             are the same as those shown in the block diagram of Fig. 8.14(a). It is naive to conclude             that an HDL description of a system is correct on the basis of the output it generates             under the application of a few input signals. A more strategic approach to testing and             verification exploits the partition of the design into its datapath and control unit. This             partition supports separate verification of the controller and the datapath. A separate             test bench can be developed to verify that the datapath executes each operation and             generates status signals correctly. After the datapath unit is verified, the next step is to             verify that each control signal is formed correctly by the control unit. A separate test             bench can verify that the control unit exhibits the complete functionality specified by             the ASMD chart (i.e., that it makes the correct state transitions and asserts its outputs             in response to the external inputs and the status signals).                 A verified control unit and a verified datapath unit together do not guarantee that             the system will operate correctly. The final step in the design process is to integrate             the verified models within a parent module and verify the functionality of the overall             machine. The interface between the controller and the datapath must be examined in             order to verify that the ports are connected correctly. For example, a mismatch in the             listed order of signals may not be detected by the compiler. After the datapath unit             and the control unit have been verified, a third test bench should verify the specified             functionality of the complete system. In practice, this requires writing a comprehensive             test plan identifying that functionality. For example, the test plan would identify the             need to verify that the sequential multiplier asserts the signal Ready in state S_idle.             The exercise to write a test plan is not academic: The quality and scope of the test plan             determine the worth of the verification effort. The test plan guides the development             of the test bench and increases the likelihood that the final design will match its             specification.                 Testing and verifying an HDL model usually requires access to more information             than the inputs and outputs of the machine. Knowledge of the state of the control unit,             the control signals, the status signals, and the internal registers of the datapath might             all be necessary for debugging. Fortunately, Verilog provides a mechanism to hierarchi-             cally de\\\\reference identifiers so that any variable at any level of the design hierarchy             can be visible to the test bench. Procedural statements can display the information             required to support efforts to debug the machine. Simulators use this mechanism to             display waveforms of any variable in the design hierarchy. To use the mechanism, we             reference the variable by its hierarchical path name. For example, the register P within             the datapath unit is not an output port of the multiplier, but it can be referenced as             M0.P. The hierarchical path name consists of the sequence of module identifiers or             block names, separated by periods and specifying the location of the variable in the             design hierarchy. We also note that simulators commonly have a graphical user interface             that displays all levels of the hierarchy of a design.                 The first test bench in HDL Example 8.6 uses the system task $strobe to display the             result of the computations. This task is similar to the $display and $monitor tasks             explained in Section 4.12. The $strobe system task provides a synchronization mecha-             nism to ensure that data are displayed only after all assignments in a given time step are             executed. This is very useful in synchronous sequential circuits, where the time step             begins at a clock edge and multiple assignments may occur at the same time step of             simulation. When the system is synchronized to the positive edge of the clock, using             $strobe after the always @ (posedge clock) statement ensures that the display shows             values of the signal after the clock pulse.                 The test bench module t_Sequential_Binary_Multiplier in HDL Example 8.6 instan-             tiates the module Sequential Binary_Multiplier of HDL Example 8.5. Both modules             must be included as source files when simulating the multiplier with a Verilog HDL             simulator. The result of this simulation displays a simulation log with numbers identi-             cal to the ones in Table 8.5. The code includes a second test bench to exhaustively             multiply five\\\\bit values of the multiplicand and the multiplier. Waveforms for a sample             of simulation results are shown in Fig. 8.19. The numerical values of Multiplicand,             Multiplier, and Product are displayed in decimal and hexadecimal formats. Insight can             be gained by studying the displayed waveforms of the control state, the control signals,             the status signals, and the register operations. Enhancements to the multiplier and its             test bench are considered in the problems at the end of this chapter. In this example,             1910 * 2310 = 43710, and 17H + 0bH = 02H with C = 1. Note the need for the carry bit.

In this form of modeling, a synthesis             tool performs Boolean optimization and translates the HDL description of a circuit into             a netlist of gates in a particular technology, e.g., CMOS. Hardware design at this level often             requires cleverness and accrued experience. It is the most tedious and detailed form of             modeling. In contrast, behavioral RTL modeling specifies functionality abstractly, in terms             of HDL operators. The RTL model does not specify a gate\\\\level implementation of the             registers or the logic to control the operations that manipulate their contentsthose tasks             are accomplished by a synthesis tool. RTL modeling implicitly schedules operations by             explicitly assigning them to clock cycles. The most abstract form of behavioral modeling             describes only an algorithm, without any reference to a physical implementation, a set of             resources, or a schedule for their use. Thus, algorithmic modeling allows a designer to             explore trade\\\\offs in the space (hardware) and time domains, trading processing speed             for hardware complexity.                 HDL Example 8.7 presents an RTL model and an algorithmic model of a binary             multiplier. Both use a level\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior. The RTL model expresses the             functionality of a multiplier in a single statement. A synthesis tool will associate with             the multiplication operator a gate\\\\level circuit equivalent to that shown in Section 4.7.             In simulation, when either the multiplier or the multiplicand changes, the product will             be updated. The time required to form the product will depend on the propagation             delays of the gates available in the library of standard cells used by the synthesis tool.             The second model is an algorithmic description of the multiplier. A synthesis tool will             unroll the loop of the algorithm and infer the need for a gate\\\\level circuit equivalent to             that shown in Section 4.7.                 Be aware that a synthesis tool may not be able to synthesize a given algorithmic             description, even though the associated HDL model will simulate and produce correct             results. One difficulty is that the sequence of operations implied by an algorithm might             not be physically realizable in a single clock cycle. It then becomes necessary to distrib-             ute the operations over multiple clock cycles. A tool for synthesizing RTL logic will not             be able to automatically accomplish the required distribution of effort, but a tool that HDL Example 8.7 // Behavioral (RTL) description of a parallel multiplier (n = 8) module Mult (Product, Multiplicand, Multiplier); input [7: 0] Multiplicand, Multiplier; output reg [15: 0] Product; always @ (Multiplicand, Multiplier) Product = Multiplicand * Multiplier; endmodule module Algorithmic_Binary_Multiplier #(parameter dp_width = 5) ( output [2*dp_width -1: 0] Product, input [dp_width -1: 0] Multiplicand, Multiplier); reg [dp_width -1: 0]          A, B, Q;               // Sized for datapath reg                           C; integer                       k; assign                        Product = {C, A, Q}; always @ (Multiplier, Multiplicand) begin Q = Multiplier; B = Multiplicand; C = 0; A = 0; for (k = 0; k <= dp_width -1; k = k + 1) begin if (Q[0]) {C, A} = A + B; {C, A, Q} = {C, A, Q} >> 1; end end endmodule module t_Algorithmic_Binary_Multiplier; parameter                     dp_width = 5; // Width of datapath wire [2* dp_width -1: 0]      Product; reg [dp_width -1: 0]          Multiplicand, Multiplier; integer                       Exp_Value; reg                           Error; Algorithmic_Binary_Multiplier M0 (Product, Multiplicand, Multiplier); // Error detection initial # 1030000 finish; always @ (Product) begin Exp_Value = Multiplier * Multiplicand; // Exp_Value = Multiplier * Multiplicand +1; // Inject error to confirm detection Error = Exp_Value ^ Product; end // Generate multiplier and multiplicand exhaustively for 5 bit operands initial begin #5 Multiplicand = 0; Multiplier = 0;                                                           Section 8.10 Design with Multiplexers 411                       repeat (32) #10 begin Multiplier = Multiplier + 1;                        repeat (32) #5 Multiplicand = Multiplicand + 1;                       end                     end                    endmodule             is designed to synthesize algorithms should be successful. In effect, a behavioral synthe-             sis tool would have to allocate the registers and adders to implement multiplication. If             only a single adder is to be shared by all of the operations that form a partial sum, the             activity must be distributed over multiple clock cycles and in the correct sequence, ulti-             mately leading to the sequential binary multiplier for which we have explicitly designed             the controller for its datapath. Behavioral synthesis tools require a different and more             sophisticated style of modeling and are not within the scope of this text. 8.10 DESIGN WITH MULTIPLEXERS             The register\\\\and\\\\decoder scheme for the design of a controller has three parts: the             flip\\\\flops that hold the binary state value, the decoder that generates the control outputs,             and the gates that determine the next\\\\state and output signals. In Section 4.11, it was             shown that a combinational circuit can be implemented with multiplexers instead of             individual gates. Replacing the gates with multiplexers results in a regular pattern of             three levels of components. The first level consists of multiplexers that determine the             next state of the register. The second level contains a register that holds the present             binary state. The third level has a decoder that asserts a unique output line for each             control state. These three components are predefined standard cells in many integrated             circuits.                 Consider, for example, the ASM chart of Fig. 8.20, consisting of four states and four             control inputs. We are interested in only the control signals governing the state sequence.             These signals are independent of the register operations of the datapath, so the edges of             the graph are not annotated with datapath register operations, and the graph does not             identify the output signals of the controller. The binary assignment for each state is indi-             cated at the upper right corner of the state boxes. The decision boxes specify the state             transitions as a function of the four control inputs: w, x, y, and z. The three\\\\level control             implementation, shown in Fig. 8.21, consists of two multiplexers, MUX1 and MUX2;             a register with two flip\\\\flops, G1and G0; and a decoder with four outputsd0, d1, d2, and             d3, corresponding to S_0, S_1, S_2, and S_3, respectively. The outputs of the state\\\\register             flip\\\\flops are applied to the decoder inputs and also to the select inputs of the multiplexers.             In this way, the present state of the register is used to select one of the inputs from each             multiplexer. The outputs of the multiplexers are then applied to the D inputs of G1 and             G0. The purpose of each multiplexer is to produce an input to its corresponding flip\\\\flop             equal to the binary value of that bit of the next\\\\state vector. The inputs of the multiplexers                                               00                             S_0                                               0                                     w                                        1                                               01                             S_1                             0  x  1                         11                                                10       S_3                                               S_2       0     y  1                                        1     y  0 0  z     1                           1               z     0     FIGURE 8.20     Example of ASM chart with four control inputs are determined from the decision boxes and state transitions given in the ASM chart. For example, state 00 stays at 00 or goes to 01, depending on the value of input w. Since the next state of G1 is 0 in either case, we place a signal equivalent to logic 0 in MUX1 input 0. The next state of G0 is 0 if w = 0 and 1 if w = 1. Since the next state of G0 is equal to w, we apply control input w to MUX2 input 0. This means that when the select inputs of the multiplexers are equal to present state 00, the outputs of the multiplexers provide the binary value that is transferred to the register at the next clock pulse.

Table 8.8 gives this information for the ASM chart of Fig. 8.20. There are two transitions from present state 00 or 01 and three from present state 10 or 11. The sets of transitions are sepa- rated by horizontal lines across the table. The input conditions listed in the table are obtained from the decision boxes in the ASM chart. For example, from Fig. 8.20, we note that present state 01 will go to next state 10 if x = 1 or to next state 11 if x = 0. In the table, we mark these input conditions as x and x, respectively. The two columns under multiplexer inputs in the table specify the input values that must be applied to MUX1 and MUX2. The multiplexer input for each present state is determined from the input conditions when the next state of the flip\\\\flop is equal to 1. Thus, after present state 01, the next state of G1 is always equal to 1 and the next state of G0 is equal to the complement of x. Therefore, the input of MUX1 is made equal to 1 and that of MUX2 to xwhen the present state of the register is 01. As another example, after pres- ent state 10, the next state of G1 must be equal to 1 if the input conditions are yz or yz. When these two Boolean terms are ORed together and then simplified, we obtain the single binary variable y, as indicated in the table. The next state of G0 is equal to 1 if the input conditions are yz = 11. If the next state of G1 remains at 0 after a given present state, we place a 0 in the multiplexer input, as shown in present state 00 for Table 8.8 Multiplexer Input Conditions Present  Next                    Input                   Inputs MUX2  State   State                Condition                                    w                                                                            x G1 G0    G1 G0                s          MUX1                                             0 0 0      0 0                  w             1 0 0      0 1                  w 0 1      1 0                  x 0 1      1 1                  x 1 0      0 0                  y 1 0      1 0                  yz 1 0      1 1                  yz         yz + yz = y     yz 1 1      0 1                  yz 1 1      1 0                  y 1 1      1 1                  yz         y + yz = y + z  yz + yz = y             MUX1. If the next state of G1 is always 1, we place a 1 in the multiplexer input, as             shown in present state 01 for MUX1. The other entries for MUX1 and MUX2 are             derived in a similar manner. The multiplexer inputs from the table are then used in the             control implementation of Fig. 8.21. Note that if the next state of a flip\\\\flop is a function             of two or more control variables, the multiplexer may require one or more gates in its             input. Otherwise, the multiplexer input is equal to the control variable, the complement             of the control variable, 0, or 1. Design Example: Count the Number of Ones in a Register             We will demonstrate the multiplexer implementation of the logic for a control unit by             means of a design examplea system that is to count the number of 1s in a word of             data. The example will also demonstrate the formulation of the ASMD chart and the             implementation of the datapath subsystem.                 From among various alternatives, we will consider a ones counter consisting of two             registers R1 and R2, and a flip\\\\flop E. (A more efficient implementation is considered             in the problems at the end of the chapter.) The system counts the number of 1s in the             number loaded into register R1 and sets register R2 to that number. For example, if the             binary number loaded into R1 is 10111001, the circuit counts the five 1s in R1 and sets             register R2 to the binary count 101. This is done by shifting each bit from register R1             one at a time into flip\\\\flop E. The value in E is checked by the control, and each time it             is equal to 1, register R2 is incremented by 1.                 The block diagram of the datapath and controller are shown in Fig. 8.22(a). The             datapath contains registers R1, R2, and E, as well as logic to shift the leftmost bit of R1             into E. The unit also contains logic (a NOR gate to detect whether R1 is 0, but that                                                     Status                        data                                                     signals                                                              E                                                                  Zero                                                                          E        Datapath     R1                                                              Load_regs                    ...

The external input signal Start launches the operation             of the machine; Ready indicates the status of the machine to the external environment.             The controller has status input signals E and Zero from the datapath. These signals             indicate the contents of a register holding the MSB of the data word and the condition             that the data word is 0, respectively. E is the output of the flip\\\\flop. Zero is the output             of a circuit that checks the contents of register R1 for all 0s. The circuit produces an             output Zero = 1 when R1 is equal to 0 (i.e., when R1 is empty of 1s).                 A preliminary ASMD chart showing the state sequence and the register operations             is illustrated in Fig. 8.22(b), and the complete ASMD chart in Fig. 8.22(c). Asserting             Start with the controller in S_idle transfers the state to S_1, concurrently loads reg-             ister R1 with the binary data word, and fills the cells of R2 with 1s. Note that incre-             menting a number with all 1s in a counter register produces a number with all 0s.             Thus, the first transition from S_1 to S_2 will clear R2. Subsequent transitions will             have R2 holding a count of the bits of data that have been processed. The content of             R1, as indicated by Zero, will also be examined in S_1. If R1 is empty, Zero = 1, and             the state returns to S_idle, where it asserts Ready. In state S_1, Incr_R2 is asserted             to cause the datapath unit to increment R2 at each clock pulse. If R1 is not empty of             1s, then Zero = 0, indicating that there are some 1s stored in the register. The num-             ber in R1 is shifted and its leftmost bit is transferred into E. This is done as many             times as necessary, until a 1 is transferred into E. For every 1 detected in E, register             R2 is incremented and register R1 is checked again for more 1s. The major loop is             repeated until all the 1s in R1 are counted. Note that the state box of S_3 has no             register operations, but the block associated with it contains the decision box for E.             Note also that the serial input to shift register R1 must be equal to 0 because we dont             want to shift external 1s into R1. The register R1 in Fig. 8.22(a) is a shift register.             Register R2 is a counter with parallel load. The multiplexer input conditions for the             control are determined from Table 8.9. The input conditions are obtained from the             ASMD chart for each possible binary state transition.

The transition from present state 00 depends on Start. The transition from present state 01 depends on Zero, and the transition from pres- ent state 11 on E. Present state 10 goes to next state 11 unconditionally. The values under MUX1 and MUX2 in the table are determined from the Boolean input condi- tions for the next state of G1 and G0, respectively.    The control implementation of the design example is shown in Fig. 8.23. This is a three\\\\level implementation, with the multiplexers in the first level. The inputs to the multiplexers are obtained from Table 8.9. The Verilog description in HDL Example 8.8 instantiates structural models of the controller and the datapath. The listing of code includes the lower level modules implementing their structures. Note that the datapath unit does not have a reset signal to clear the registers, but the models for the flip\\\\flop, shift register, and counter have an active\\\\low reset. This illustrates the use of Verilog data type supply1 to hardwire those ports to logic value 1 in their instantiation within Datapath_STR. Note also that the test bench uses hierarchical de\\\\referencing to access the state of the controller to make the debug and verification tasks easier, without hav- ing to alter the module ports to provide access to the internal signals. Another detail to observe is that the serial input to the shift register is hardwired to 0. The lower level models are described behaviorally for simplicity.

In Fig. 8.24(a), reset_b is toggled             low at t = 3 to drive the controller into S_idle, but with Start not yet having an assigned             value. (The default is x.) Consequently, the controller enters an unknown state (the             shaded waveform) at the next clock, and its outputs are unknown.4 When reset_b is             asserted (low) again at t = 27, the state enters S_idle.Then, with Start = 1 at the first clock             after reset_b is de\\\\asserted, (1) the controller enters S_1, (2) Load_regs causes R1 to be             set to the value of data, namely, 8Hff, and (3) R2 is filled with 1s.

There are various potential sources of mismatch between the results of a simulation, but we will consider one that typically happens in HDL\\\\based design methodology. Three realities contribute to the potential problem: (1) a physical feedback path exists between a datapath unit and a control unit whose inputs include status signals fed back from the datapath unit; (2) blocked procedural assignments execute immediately, and behavioral models simu- late with 0 propagation delays, effectively creating immediate changes in the outputs of combinational logic when its inputs change (i.e., changes in the inputs and the outputs are scheduled in the same time step of the simulation); and (3) the order in which a simulator executes multiple blocked assignments to the same variable at a given time step of the simulation is indeterminate (i.e., unpredictable).                 Now consider a sequential machine with an HDL model in which all assignments             are made with the blocked assignment operator. At a clock pulse, the register opera-             tions in the datapath, the state transitions in the controller, the updates of the next             state and output logic of the controller, and the updates to the status signals in the             datapath are all scheduled to occur at the same time step of the simulation. Which             executes first? Suppose that when a clock pulse occurs, the state of the controller             changes before the register operations execute. The change in the state could change             the outputs of the control unit. The new values of the outputs would be used by the             datapath when it finally executes its assignments at that same clock pulse. The result             might not be the same as it would have been if the datapath had executed its assign-             ments before the control unit updated its state and outputs. Conversely, suppose that             when the clock pulse occurs, the datapath unit executes its operations and updates its             status signals first. The updated status signals could cause a change in the value of the             next state of the controller, which would be used to update the state. The result could             differ from that which would result if the state had been updated before the edge\\\\             sensitive operations in the datapath executed. In either case, the timing of register             transfer operations and state transitions in the different representations of the system             might not match. Failing to detect a mismatch can have disastrous consequences for             the user of the design. Finding the source of the mismatch can be very time\\\\consuming             and costly. It is better to avoid the mismatch by following a strict discipline in your             design. Fortunately, there is a solution to this dilemma.                 A designer can eliminate the software race conditions just described by observing             the rule of modeling combinational logic with blocked assignments and modeling             state transitions and edge\\\\sensitive register operations with nonblocking assign-             ments. A software race cannot happen if nonblocking operators are used as shown             in all of the examples in this text, because the sampling mechanism of the nonblock-             ing operator breaks the feedback path between a state transition or edge\\\\sensitive             datapath operation and the combinational logic that forms the next state or inputs             to the registers in the datapath unit. The mechanism does this because simulators             evaluate the expressions on the right\\\\hand side of their nonblocking assignment             statements before any blocked assignments are made. Thus, the nonblocking assign-             ments cannot be affected by the results of the blocked assignments. This matches the             hardware reality. Always use the blocking operator to model combinational logic,             and use the nonblocking operator to model edge\\\\sensitive register operations and             state transitions.                 It also might appear that the physical structure of a datapath and the controller             together create a physical (i.e., hardware), race condition, because the status signals are             fed back to the controller and the outputs of the controller are fed forward to the             datapath. However, timing analysis can verify that a change in the output of the control-             ler will not propagate through the datapath logic and then through the input logic of             the controller in time to have an effect on the output of the controller until the next             clock pulse. The state cannot update until the next edge of the clock, even though the             status signals update the value of the next state. The flip\\\\flop cuts the feedback path                               Section 8.12 Latch\\\\Free Design (Why Waste Silicon?) 425       between clock cycles. In practice, timing analysis verifies that the circuit will operate at       the specified clock frequency, or it identifies signal paths whose propagation delays are       problematic. Remember, the design must implement the correct logic and operate at       the speed prescribed by the clock. 8.12  LATCH\\\\FREE DESIGN (WHY WASTE       SILICON?)       Continuous assignments model combinational logic implicitly. A feedback\\\\free continu-       ous assignment will synthesize to combinational logic, and the inputCoutput relationship       of the logic is automatically sensitive to all of the inputs of the circuit. In simulation, the       simulator monitors the right\\\\hand sides of all continuous assignments, detects a change       in any of the referenced variables, and updates the left\\\\hand side of an affected assign-       ment statement. Unlike a continuous assignment, a cyclic behavior is not necessarily       completely sensitive to all of the variables that are referenced by its assignment state-       ments. If a level\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior is used to describe combinational logic, it is       essential that the sensitivity list include every variable that is referenced on the right\\\\hand       side of an assignment statement in the behavior. If the list is incomplete, the logic       described by the behavior will be synthesized with latches at the outputs of the logic. This       implementation wastes silicon area and may have a mismatch between the simulation of       the behavioral model and the synthesized circuit. These difficulties can be avoided by       ensuring that the sensitivity list is complete, but, in large circuits, it is easy to fail to include       every referenced variable in the sensitivity list of a level\\\\sensitive cyclic behavior.       Consequently, Verilog 2001 included a new operator to reduce the risk of accidentally       synthesizing latches.          In Verilog 2001, the tokens @ and * can be combined as @* or @(*) and are used       without a sensitivity list to indicate that execution of the associated statement is sensi-       tive to every variable that is referenced on the right\\\\hand side of an assignment state-       ment in the logic. In effect, the operator @* indicates that the logic is to be interpreted       HDL Example 8.9       The following level-sensitive cyclic behavior will synthesize a two-channel multiplexer:       module mux_2_V2001 (output reg [31: 0] y, input [31: 0] a, b, input sel);        always @*        y = sel ? a: b;       endmodule       The cyclic behavior has an implicit sensitivity list consisting of a, b, and sel.             and synthesized as level\\\\sensitive combinational logic; the logic has an implicit sensitivity             list composed of all of the variables that are referenced by the procedural assignments.             Using the @* operator will prevent accidental synthesis of latches. 8.13 OTHER LANGUAGE FEATURES             The examples in this text have used only those features of the Verilog HDL that are             appropriate for an introductory course in logic design. Verilog 2001 contains features             that are very useful to designers, but which are not considered here. Among them are             multidimensional arrays, variable part selects, array bit and part selects, signed reg, net,             and port declarations, and local parameters. These enhancements are treated in more             advanced texts using Verilog 2001 and Verilog 2005. PROBLEMS Answers to problems marked with * appear at the end of the book. 8.1*  Explain in words and write HDL statements for the operations specified by the following       register transfer notation:       (a) R2 d R2 + 1, R1 d R       (b) R3 d R3 - 1       (c) If (S1 = 1) then (R0 d R1) else if (S2 = 1) then (R0 d R2) 8.2 A logic circuit with active\\\\low synchronous reset has two control inputs x and y. If x is 1          and y is 0, register R is incremented by 1 and control goes to a second state. If x is 0 and y          is 1, register R is cleared to zero and control goes from the initial state to a third state.          Otherwise, control stays in the initial state. Draw (1) a block diagram showing the control-          ler, datapath unit (with internal registers), and signals, and (2) the portion of an ASMD          chart starting from an initial state. 8.3 Draw the ASMD charts for the following state transitions:          (a) If x = 1, control goes from state S1 to state S2; if x = 0, generate a conditional opera-               tion R 6 = R + 2 and go from S1 to S2.          (b) If x = 1, control goes from S1 to S2 and then to S3; if x = 0, control goes from S1to S3.          (c) Start from state S1; then if xy = 11, go to S2; if xy = 01 go to S3; and if xy = 10, go to S1;               otherwise, go to S3. 8.4 Show the eight exit paths in an ASM block emanating from the decision boxes that check          the eight possible binary values of three control variables x, y, and z. 8.5 Explain how the ASM and ASMD charts differ from a conventional flowchart. Using          Fig. 8.5 as an illustration, show the difference in interpretation. Explain the difference          between and ASM chart and an ASMD chart. In your own words, discuss the use and merit          of using an ASMD chart. 8.6 Construct a block diagram and an ASMD chart for a digital system that counts the number          of people in a room. The one door through which people enter the room has a photocell          that changes a signal x from 1 to 0 while the light is interrupted. They leave the room from                                                             Problems 427 8.7*  a second door with a similar photocell that changes a signal y from 1 to 0 while the light       is interrupted. The datapath circuit consists of an upCdown counter with a display that       shows how many people are in the room.       Draw a block diagram and an ASMD chart for a circuit with two eight\\\\bit registers RA       and RB that receive two unsigned binary numbers. The circuit performs the subtraction       operation           RA d RA - RB 8.8*  Use the method for subtraction described in Section 1.5, and set a borrow flip\\\\flop to 1 if       the answer is negative. Write and verify an HDL model of the circuit. 8.9* 8.10  Design a digital circuit with three 16\\\\bit registers AR, BR, and CR that perform the       following operations:       (a) Transfer two 16\\\\bit signed numbers (in 2s\\\\complement representation) to AR and BR.       (b) If the number in AR is negative, divide the number in AR by 2 and transfer the result            to register CR.       (c) If the number in AR is positive but nonzero, multiply the number in BR by 2 and            transfer the result to register CR.       (d) If the number in AR is zero, clear register CR to 0.       (e) Write and verify a behavioral model of the circuit.       Design the controller whose state diagram is given by Fig. 8.11(a). Use one flip\\\\flop per       state (a one\\\\hot assignment). Write, simulate, verify, and compare RTL and structural       models of the controller.       The state diagram of a control unit is shown in Fig. P8.10. It has four states and two       inputs x and y. Draw the equivalent ASM chart. Write and verify a Verilog model of the       controller.                           x0                       00           x1            x1                   y1                   x0                       01                                y0               x  0, y  0       x0  11                                            10  x1       y1                                                    y0               x  1, y  1       FIGURE P8.10       Control state diagram for Problems 8.10 and 8.11 8.11* Design the controller whose state diagram is shown in Fig. P8.10. Use D flip\\\\flops. 8.12 Design the four\\\\bit counter with synchronous clear specified in Fig. 8.10. Repeat for          asynchronous clear. 8.13  Simulate Design_Example_STR (see HDL Example 8.4), and verify that its behavior       matches that of the RTL description. Obtain state information by displaying G0 and G1       as a concatenated vector for the state. 8.14 What, if any, are the consequences of the machine in Design_Example_RTL (see HDL          Example 8.2) entering an unused state? 8.15 Simulate Design_Example_RTL in HDL Example 8.2, and verify that it recovers from an          unexpected reset condition during its operation, i.e., a running reset or a reset on\\\\the\\\\fly. 8.16* Develop a block diagram and an ASMD chart for a digital circuit that multiplies two binary          numbers by the repeated\\\\addition method. For example, to multiply 5 * 4, the digital system          evaluates the product by adding the multiplicand four times: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20. Design the          circuit. Let the multiplicand be in register BR, the multiplier in register AR, and the product          in register PR.An adder circuit adds the contents of BR to PR.A zero\\\\detection signal indi-          cates whether AR is 0. Write and verify a Verilog behavioral model of the circuit. 8.17* Prove that the multiplication of two n\\\\bit numbers gives a product of length less than or          equal to 2n bits. 8.18* In Fig. 8.14, the Q register holds the multiplier and the B register holds the multiplicand.          Assume that each number consists of 16 bits.          (a) How many bits can be expected in the product, and where is it available?          (b) How many bits are in the P counter, and what is the binary number loaded into it               initially?          (c) Design the circuit that checks for zero in the P counter. 8.19 List the contents of registers C, A, Q, and P in a manner similar to Table 8.5 during the          process of multiplying the two numbers 11011 (multiplicand) and 10111 (multiplier). 8.20* Determine the time it takes to process the multiplication operation in the binary multi-          plier described in Section 8.8. Assume that the Q register has n bits and the clock cycle is          t ns. 8.21 Design the control circuit of the binary multiplier specified by the state diagram of Fig. 8.16,          using multiplexers, a decoder, and a register. 8.22  Figure P8.22 shows an alternative ASMD chart for a sequential binary multiplier. Write and       verify an RTL model of the system. Compare this design with that described by the ASMD       chart in Fig. 8.15(b). 8.23  Figure P8.23 shows an alternative ASMD chart for a sequential binary multiplier. Write       and verify an RTL model of the system. Compare this design with that described by the       ASMD chart in Fig. 8.15(b). 8.24  The HDL description of a sequential binary multiplier given in HDL Example 8.5       encapsulates the descriptions of the controller and the datapath in a single Verilog       module. Write and verify a model that encapsulates the controller and datapath in       separate modules. 8.25  The sequential binary multiplier described by the ASMD chart in Fig. 8.15 does not consider       whether the multiplicand or the shifted multiplier is 0. Therefore, it executes for a fixed       number of clock cycles, independently of the data.       (a) Develop an ASMD chart for a more efficient multiplier that will terminate execution            as soon as either word is found to be zero.

Execute the test plan and 8.37       produce annotated simulation results relating the test plan to the waveforms produced            in a simulation. 8.38       (e) Write Count_Ones_BEH_1_Hot, a top\\\\level module encapsulating the module Con-            troller_BEH_1_Hot and Datapath_BEH. Write a test plan and a test bench, and verify            the description. Produce annotated simulation results relating the test plan to the            waveforms produced in a simulation.       The HDL description and test bench for a circuit that counts the number of ones in a       register are given in HDL Example 8.8. Modify the test bench and simulate the circuit to       verify that the system operates correctly for the following patterns of data: 8hff, 8h0f,       8hf0, 8h00, 8haa, 8h0a, 8ha0, 8h55, 8h05, 8h50, 8ha5, and 8h5a .       The design of a circuit that counts the number of ones in a register is carried out in Section       8.10. The block diagram for the circuit is shown in Fig. 8.22(a), a complete ASMD chart       for this circuit appears in Fig. 8.22(c), and structural HDL models of the datapath and       controller are given in HDL Example 8.8. Using the operations and signal names indi-       cated on the ASMD chart,       (a) Design the control logic, employing one flip\\\\flop per state (a one\\\\hot assignment). List            the input equations for the four flip\\\\flops.       (b) Write Controller_Gates_1_Hot, a gate\\\\level HDL structural description of the circuit,            using the control designed in part (a) and the signals shown in the block diagram of            Fig. 8.22(a).       (c) Write a test plan and a test bench, and then verify the controller.       (d) Write Count_Ones_Gates_1_Hot_STR, a top\\\\level module encapsulating and integrating            instantiations of Controller_Gates_1_Hot and Datapath_STR. Write a test plan and a            test bench to verify the description. Produce annotated simulation results relating the            test plan to the waveforms produced in a simulation.       Compared with the circuit presented in HDL Example 8.8, a more efficient circuit that       counts the number of ones in a data word is described by the block diagram and the par-       tially completed ASMD chart in Fig. P8.37. This circuit accomplishes addition and shifting       in the same clock cycle and adds the LSB of the data register to the counter register at       every clock cycle.       (a) Complete the ASMD chart.       (b) Using the ASMD chart, write an RTL description of the circuit. A top\\\\level Verilog            module, Count_of_ones_2_Beh is to instantiate separate modules for the datapath and            control units.       (c) Design the control logic, using one flip\\\\flop per state (a one\\\\hot assignment). List the            input equations for the flip\\\\flops.       (d) Write the HDL structural description of the circuit, using the controller designed in            part (c) and the block diagram of Fig. P8.37(a).       (e) Write a test bench to test the circuit. Simulate the circuit to verify the operation described            in both the RTL and the structural programs.       The addition of two signed binary numbers in the signed\\\\magnitude representation follows       the rules of ordinary arithmetic: If the two numbers have the same sign (both positive or       both negative), the two magnitudes are added and the sum has the common sign; if the       two numbers have opposite signs, the smaller magnitude is subtracted from the larger and                 Status                                                 reset_b                 signals             data                          R1[0]                          Zero                                            S_idle                                                                          Ready    Start  Controller     Add_shift  Datapath R1                                    R1  data Ready                                    ...

The left-                 most bit of the number holds the sign and the other seven bits hold the magnitude.           8.39* For the circuit designed in Problem 8.16,                    (a) Write and verify a structural HDL description of the circuit. The datapath and control-                         ler are to be described in separate units.                    (b) Write and verify an RTL description of the circuit. The datapath and controller are to                         be described in separate units.           8.40  Modify the block diagram of the sequential multiplier given in Fig. 8.14(a) and the ASMD                 chart in Fig. 8.15(b) to describe a system that multiplies 32\\\\bit words, but with 8\\\\bit (byte-                 wide) external datapaths. The machine is to assert Ready in the (initial) reset state. When                 Start is asserted, the machine is to fetch the data bytes from a single 8\\\\bit data bus in                 consecutive clock cycles (multiplicand bytes first, followed by multiplier bytes, least sig-                 nificant byte first) and store the data in datapath registers. Got_Data is to be asserted for                 one cycle of the clock when the transfer is complete. When Run is asserted, the product is                 to be formed sequentially. Done_Product is to be asserted for one clock cycle when the                 multiplication is complete. When a signal Send_Data is asserted, each byte of the product                 is to be placed on an 8\\\\bit output bus for one clock cycle, in sequence, beginning with the                 least significant byte. The machine is to return to the initial state after the product has                 been transmitted. Consider safeguards, such as not attempting to send or receive data                 while the product is being formed. Consider also other features that might eliminate need-                 less multiplication by 0. For example, do not continue to multiply if the shifted multiplier                 is empty of 1s.

Decimators are used in digital signal processors to move data from a datapath with a high                clock rate to a datapath with a lower clock rate, converting data from a parallel format                to a serial format in the process. In the datapath shown, entire words of data can be trans-                ferred into the pipeline at twice the rate at which the contents of the pipeline must be                dumped into a holding register or consumed by some processor. The contents of the                holding register R0 can be shifted out serially, to accomplish an overall parallel\\\\to\\\\serial                conversion of the data stream. The ASMD chart indicates that the machine has synchro-                nous reset to S_idle, where it waits until rst is de\\\\asserted and En is asserted. Note that                synchronous transitions which would occur from the other states to S_idle under the                action of rst are not shown. With En asserted, the machine transitions from S_idle to S_1,                accompanied by concurrent register operations that load the MSByte of the pipe with                Data and move the content of P1 to the LSByte (P0). At the next clock, the state goes to                S_full, and now the pipe is full. If Ld is asserted at the next clock, the machine moves to                S_1 while dumping the pipe into a holding register R0. If Ld is not asserted, the machine 8.42  enters S_wait and remains there until Ld is asserted, at which time it dumps the pipe and       returns to S_1 or to S_idle, depending on whether En is asserted, too. The data rate at R0       is one\\\\half the rate at which data are supplied to the unit from an external datapath.       (a) Develop the complete ASMD chart.       (b) Using the ASMD chart developed in (a), write and verify an HDL model of the            datapath.       (c) Write and verify a Verilog behavioral model of the control unit.       (d) Encapsulate the datapath and controller in a top\\\\level module, and verify the integrated            system.       The count\\\\of\\\\ones circuit described in Fig. 8.22 has a latency that is to be eliminated. It       arises because the status signal E is formed as the output of a flip\\\\flop into which the MSB       of R1 is shifted. Develop a design that eliminates the latency.

The       experiments give the student using this book hands\\\\on experience. The digital circuits       can be constructed by using standard integrated circuits (ICs) mounted on breadboards       that are easily assembled in the laboratory. The experiments are ordered according to       the material presented in the book. The last section consists of a number of supplements       with suggestions for using the Verilog HDL to simulate and verify the functionality of       the digital circuits presented in the experiments. If an FPGA prototyping board is avail-       able, the experiments can be implemented in an FPGA as an alternative to standard ICs.          A logic breadboard suitable for performing the experiments must have the following       equipment:          1. Light\\\\emitting diode (LED) indicator lamps.          2. Toggle switches to provide logic\\\\1 and logic\\\\0 signals.          3. Pulsers with push buttons and debounce circuits to generate single pulses.          4. A clock\\\\pulse generator with at least two frequencies: a low frequency of about              1 pulse per second to observe slow changes in digital signals and a higher frequency              for observing waveforms in an oscilloscope.          5. A power supply of 5 V.          6. Socket strips for mounting the ICs.           7. Solid hookup wires and a pair of wire strippers for cutting the wires.          Digital logic trainers that include the required equipment are available from several       manufacturers. A digital logic trainer contains LED lamps, toggle switches, pulsers, 438                                           Section 9.1 Introduction to Experiments 439 a variable clock, a power supply, and IC socket strips. Some experiments may require additional switches, lamps, or IC socket strips. Extended breadboards with more solder- less sockets and plug\\\\in switches and lamps may be needed.    Additional equipment required is a dual\\\\trace oscilloscope (for Experiments 1, 2, 8, and 15), a logic probe to be used for debugging, and a number of ICs. The ICs required for the experiments are of the TTL or CMOS series 7400.    The integrated circuits to be used in the experiments can be classified as small\\\\scale integration (SSI) or medium\\\\scale integration (MSI) circuits. SSI circuits contain indi- vidual gates or flip\\\\flops, and MSI circuits perform specific digital functions. The eight SSI gate ICs needed for the experimentstwo\\\\input NAND, NOR, AND, OR, and XOR gates, inverters, and three\\\\input and four\\\\input NAND gatesare shown in Fig. 9.1. The pin assignments for the gates are indicated in the diagram. The pins are numbered from 1 to 14. Pin number 14 is marked VCC, and pin number 7 is marked GND (ground). These are the supply terminals, which must be connected to a power supply of 5 V for proper operation of the circuit. Each IC is recognized by its identification number; for example, the two\\\\input NAND gates are found inside the IC whose number is 7400.    Detailed descriptions of the MSI circuits can be found in data books published by the manufacturers. The best way to acquire experience with a commercial MSI circuit is to study its description in a data book that provides complete information on the internal, external, and electrical characteristics of integrated circuits. Various semicon- ductor companies publish data books for the 7400 series. The MSI circuits that are needed for the experiments are introduced and explained when they are used for the first time. The operation of the circuit is explained by referring to similar circuits in previous chapters. The information given in this chapter about the MSI circuits should be sufficient for performing the experiments adequately. Nevertheless, reference to a data book will always be preferable, as it gives more detailed description of the circuits.    We will now demonstrate the method of presentation of MSI circuits adopted here. To illustrate, we introduce the ripple counter IC, type 7493. This IC is used in Experiment 1 and in subsequent experiments to generate a sequence of binary numbers for verifying the operation of combinational circuits.    The information about the 7493 IC that is found in a data book is shown in Figs. 9.2(a) and (b). Part (a) shows a diagram of the internal logic circuit and its connection to external pins. All inputs and outputs are given symbolic letters and assigned to pin numbers. Part (b) shows the physical layout of the IC, together with its 14\\\\pin assign- ment to signal names. Some of the pins are not used by the circuit and are marked as NC (no connection). The IC is inserted into a socket, and wires are connected to the various pins through the socket terminals. When drawing schematic diagrams in this chapter, we will show the IC in block diagram form, as in Fig. 9.2(c). The IC number (here, 7493) is written inside the block. All input terminals are placed on the left of the block and all output terminals on the right.

Inputs or outputs may sometimes be placed on the top or the            bottom of the block for convenience.               The operation of the circuit is similar to the ripple counter shown in Fig. 6.8(a) with            an asynchronous clear to each flip\\\\flop. When input R1 or R2 or both are equal to logic 0             (ground), all asynchronous clears are equal to 1 and are disabled. To clear all four flip\\\\             flops to 0, the output of the NAND gate must be equal to 0. This is accomplished by             having both inputs R1 and R2 at logic 1 (about 5 V). Note that the J and K inputs show             no connections. It is characteristic of TTL circuits that an input terminal with no exter-             nal connections has the effect of producing a signal equivalent to logic 1. Note also that             output QA is not connected to input B internally.                 The 7493 IC can operate as a three\\\\bit counter using input B and flip\\\\flops QB, QC,             and QD. It can operate as a four\\\\bit counter using input A if output QA is connected             to input B. Therefore, to operate the circuit as a four\\\\bit counter, it is necessary to have             an external connection between pin 12 and pin 1. The reset inputs, R1 and R2, at pins 2             and 3, respectively, must be grounded. Pins 5 and 10 must be connected to a 5\\\\V power             supply. The input pulses must be applied to input A at pin 14, and the four flip\\\\flop             outputs of the counter are taken from QA, QB, QC, and QD at pins 12, 9, 8, and 11,             respectively, with QA being the least significant bit.                 Figure 9.2(c) demonstrates the way that all MSI circuits will be symbolized graph-             ically in this chapter. Only a block diagram similar to the one shown in this figure             will be given for each IC. The letter symbols for the inputs and outputs in the IC block             diagram will be according to the symbols used in the data book.

The      operation of the circuit will be specified by means of a truth table or a function table.         Other possible graphic symbols for the ICs are presented in Chapter 10. These are      standard graphic symbols approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics      Engineers and are given in IEEE Standard 91\\\\1984. The standard graphic symbols for      SSI gates have rectangular shapes, as shown in Fig. 10.1. The standard graphic symbol      for the 7493 IC is shown in Fig. 10.13. This symbol can be substituted in place of the one      shown in Fig. 9.2(c). The standard graphic symbols of the other ICs that are needed to      run the experiments are presented in Chapter 10. They can be used to draw schematic      diagrams of the logic circuits if the standard symbols are preferred.         Table 9.1 lists the ICs that are needed for the experiments, together with the numbers of      the figures in which they are presented in this chapter. In addition, the table lists the numbers      of the figures in Chapter 10 in which the equivalent standard graphic symbols are drawn.         The next 18 sections present 18 hardware experiments requiring the use of digital      integrated circuits. Section 9.20 outlines HDL simulation experiments requiring a Verilog      HDL compiler and simulator. 9.2  EXPERIMENT 1: BINARY AND DECIMAL      NUMBERS       This experiment demonstrates the count sequence of binary numbers and the binary\\\\       coded decimal (BCD) representation. It serves as an introduction to the breadboard used       in the laboratory and acquaints the student with the cathode\\\\ray oscilloscope. Reference       material from the text that may be useful to know while performing the experiment can       be found in Section 1.2, on binary numbers, and Section 1.7, on BCD numbers. Binary Count             IC type 7493 consists of four flip\\\\flops, as shown in Fig. 9.2. They can be connected to             count in binary or in BCD. Connect the IC to operate as a four\\\\bit binary counter by             wiring the external terminals, as shown in Fig. 9.3.This is done by connecting a wire from             pin 12 (output QA) to pin 1 (input B). Input A at pin 14 is connected to a pulser that             provides single pulses. The two reset inputs, R1 and R2, are connected to ground. The             four outputs go to four indicator lamps, with the low\\\\order bit of the counter from QA             connected to the rightmost indicator lamp. Do not forget to supply 5 V and ground to             the IC. All connections should be made with the power supply in the off position.                 Turn the power on and observe the four indicator lamps. The four\\\\bit number in the             output is incremented by 1 for every pulse generated in the push\\\\button pulser. The             count goes to binary 15 and then back to 0. Disconnect the input of the counter at pin             14 from the pulser, and connect it to a clock generator that produces a train of pulses at             a low frequency of about 1 pulse per second. This will provide an automatic binary count.             Note that the binary counter will be used in subsequent experiments to provide the             input binary signals for testing combinational circuits.

Observe the clock output on the oscilloscope and sketch its waveform. Using a             dual\\\\trace oscilloscope, connect the output of QA to one channel and the output of the             clock to the second channel. Note that the output of QA is complemented every time the             clock pulse goes through a negative transition from 1 to 0. Note also that the clock fre-             quency at the output of the first flip\\\\flop is one\\\\half that of the input clock frequency. Each             flip\\\\flop in turn divides its incoming frequency by 2. The four\\\\bit counter divides the             incoming frequency by 16 at output QD. Obtain a timing diagram showing the relationship             of the clock to the four outputs of the counter. Make sure that you include at least 16 clock             cycles. The way to proceed with a dual\\\\trace oscilloscope is as follows: First, observe the             clock pulses and QA, and record their timing waveforms. Then repeat by observing and             recording the waveforms of QA together with QB, followed by the waveforms of QB with             QC and then QC with QD.Your final result should be a diagram showing the relationship             of the clock to the four outputs in one composite diagram having at least 16 clock cycles. BCD Count             The BCD representation uses the binary numbers from 0000 to 1001 to represent the             coded decimal digits from 0 to 9. IC type 7493 can be operated as a BCD counter by             making the external connections shown in Fig. 9.4. Outputs QB and QD are connected             to the two reset inputs, R1 and R2. When both R1 and R2 are equal to 1, all four cells in             the counter clear to 0 irrespective of the input pulse. The counter starts from 0, and every             input pulse increments it by 1 until it reaches the count of 1001. The next pulse changes             the ouput to 1010, making QB and QD equal to 1. This momentary output cannot be Section 9.2 Experiment 1: Binary and Decimal Numbers 445 Input   14           5          12 pulses       A    VCC    QA          1B      7493            9                          QB          2       GND              R1      10  QC 8          3                      11              R2          QD                   FIGURE 9.4                   BCD counter             sustained, because the four cells immediately clear to 0, with the result that the output             goes to 0000.Thus, the pulse after the count of 1001 changes the output to 0000, produc-             ing a BCD count.                 Connect the IC to operate as a BCD counter. Connect the input to a pulser and the             four outputs to indicator lamps. Verify that the count goes from 0000 to 1001.                 Disconnect the input from the pulser and connect it to a clock generator. Observe the             clock waveform and the four outputs on the oscilloscope. Obtain an accurate timing dia-             gram showing the relationship between the clock and the four outputs. Make sure to include             at least 10 clock cycles in the oscilloscope display and in the composite timing diagram. Output Pattern             When the count pulses into the BCD counter are continuous, the counter keeps repeat-             ing the sequence from 0000 to 1001 and back to 0000. This means that each bit in the             four outputs produces a fixed pattern of 1s and 0s that is repeated every 10 pulses. These             patterns can be predicted from a list of the binary numbers from 0000 to 1001. The list             will show that output QA, being the least significant bit, produces a pattern of alternate             1s and 0s. Output QD, being the most significant bit, produces a pattern of eight 0s             followed by two 1s. Obtain the pattern for the other two outputs and then check all four             patterns on the oscilloscope. This is done with a dual\\\\trace oscilloscope by displaying the             clock pulses in one channel and one of the output waveforms in the other channel. The             pattern of 1s and 0s for the corresponding output is obtained by observing the output             levels at the vertical positions where the pulses change from 1 to 0. Other Counts             IC type 7493 can be connected to count from 0 to a variety of final counts. This is done             by connecting one or two outputs to the reset inputs, R1 and R2.Thus, if R1 is connected             to QA instead of to QB in Fig. 9.4, the resulting count will be from 0000 to 1000, which             is 1 less than 1001 (QD = 1 and QA = 1).                 Utilizing your knowledge of how R1 and R2 affect the final count, connect the 7493             IC to count from 0000 to the following final counts:               (a) 0101               (b) 0111               (c) 1011                 Connect each circuit and verify its count sequence by applying pulses from the pulser             and observing the output count in the indicator lamps. If the initial count starts with a             value greater than the final count, keep applying input pulses until the output clears to 0. 9.3  EXPERIMENT 2: DIGITAL LOGIC GATES       In this experiment, you will investigate the logic behavior of various IC gates:              7400 quadruple two\\\\input NAND gates              7402 quadruple two\\\\input NOR gates              7404 hex inverters              7408 quadruple two\\\\input AND gates              7432 quadruple two\\\\input OR gates              7486 quadruple two\\\\input XOR gates          The pin assignments to the various gates are shown in Fig. 9.1. Quadruple means       that there are four gates within the package. The digital logic gates and their character-       istics are discussed in Section 2.8. A NAND implementation is discussed in Section 3.7. Truth Tables             Use one gate from each IC listed and obtain the truth table of the gate. The truth table             is obtained by connecting the inputs of the gate to switches and the output to an indica-             tor lamp. Compare your results with the truth tables listed in Fig. 2.5. Waveforms             For each gate listed, obtain the inputCoutput waveform of the gate. The waveforms are             to be observed in the oscilloscope. Use the two low\\\\order outputs of a binary counter             (Fig. 9.3) to provide the inputs to the gate. As an example, the circuit and waveforms             for the NAND gate are illustrated in Fig. 9.5. The oscilloscope display will repeat this             waveform, but you should record only the nonrepetitive portion.

The output will be the same as             the input, except that it will be delayed by the time it takes the signal to propagate             through all six inverters. Apply clock pulses to the input of the first inverter. Using the             oscilloscope, determine the delay from the input to the output of the sixth inverter dur-             ing the upswing of the pulse and again during the downswing. This is done with a dual\\\\             trace oscilloscope by applying the input clock pulses to one of the channels and the             output of the sixth inverter to the second channel. Set the time\\\\base knob to the lowest             time\\\\per\\\\division setting. The rise or fall time of the two pulses should appear on the             screen. Divide the total delay by 6 to obtain an average propagation delay per inverter. Universal NAND Gate             Using a single 7400 IC, connect a circuit that produces               (a) an inverter,               (b) a two\\\\input AND,               (c) a two\\\\input OR,               (d) a two\\\\input NOR,               (e) a two\\\\input XOR. (See Fig. 3.32.)             In each case, verify your circuit by checking its truth table. NAND Circuit             Using a single 7400 IC, construct a circuit with NAND gates that implements the Boolean             function                                                           F = AB + CD                 1. Draw the circuit diagram.                 2. Obtain the truth table for F as a function of the four inputs.                 3. Connect the circuit and verify the truth table.                 4. Record the patterns of 1s and 0s for F as inputs A, B, C, and D go from binary 0                     to binary 15.                 5. Connect the four outputs of the binary counter shown in Fig. 9.3 to the four inputs                     of the NAND circuit. Connect the input clock pulses from the counter to one                     channel of a dual\\\\trace oscilloscope and output F to the other channel. Observe                     and record the 1s and 0s pattern of F after each clock pulse, and compare it with                     the pattern recorded in step 4. 9.4  EXPERIMENT 3: SIMPLIFICATION      OF BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS       This experiment demonstrates the relationship between a Boolean function and the       corresponding logic diagram. The Boolean functions are simplified by using the map       method, as discussed in Chapter 3.The logic diagrams are to be drawn with NAND gates,       as explained in Section 3.7.          The gate ICs to be used for the logic diagrams must be those from Fig. 9.1 which       contain the following NAND gates:              7400 two\\\\input NAND              7404 inverter (one\\\\input NAND)              7410 three\\\\input NAND              7420 four\\\\input NAND       If an input to a NAND gate is not used, it should not be left open, but instead should be       connected to another input that is used. For example, if the circuit needs an inverter and       there is an extra two\\\\input gate available in a 7400 IC, then both inputs of the gate are       to be connected together to form a single input for an inverter. Logic Diagram             This part of the experiment starts with a given logic diagram from which we proceed to             apply simplification procedures to reduce the number of gates and, possibly, the number             of ICs. The logic diagram shown in Fig. 9.6 requires two ICsa 7400 and a 7410. Note             that the inverters for inputs x, y, and z are obtained from the remaining three gates in             the 7400 IC. If the inverters were taken from a 7404 IC, the circuit would have required             three ICs. Note also that, in drawing SSI circuits, the gates are not enclosed in blocks as             is done with MSI circuits.                 Assign pin numbers to all inputs and outputs of the gates, and connect the circuit with             the x, y, and z inputs going to three switches and the output F to an indicator lamp. Test             the circuit by obtaining its truth table.                 Obtain the Boolean function of the circuit and simplify it, using the map method. Con-             struct the simplified circuit without disconnecting the original circuit. Test both circuits by             applying identical inputs to each and observing the separate outputs. Show that, for each             of the eight possible input combinations, the two circuits have identical outputs. This will             prove that the simplified circuit behaves exactly like the original circuit. Section 9.4 Experiment 3: Simplification of Boolean Functions 449 x y  F                             z                   FIGURE 9.6                   Logic diagram for Experiment 3 Boolean Functions             Consider two Boolean functions in sum\\\\of\\\\minterms form:                                         F1(A, B, C, D) = (0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13)                                         F2(A, B, C, D) = (3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15)             Simplify these functions by means of maps. Obtain a composite logic diagram with four             inputs, A, B, C, and D, and two outputs, F1 and F2. Implement the two functions             together, using a minimum number of NAND ICs. Do not duplicate the same gate if             the corresponding term is needed for both functions. Use any extra gates in existing             ICs for inverters when possible. Connect the circuit and check its operation. The truth             table for F1 and F2 obtained from the circuit should conform with the minterms listed. Complement             Plot the following Boolean function in a map:                                                F = AD + BD + BC + ABD             Combine the 1s in the map to obtain the simplified function for F in sum\\\\of\\\\products             form. Then combine the 0s in the map to obtain the simplified function for F, also in             sum\\\\of\\\\products form. Implement both F and F with NAND gates, and connect the two             circuits to the same input switches, but to separate output indicator lamps. Obtain the             truth table of each circuit in the laboratory and show that they are the complements of             each other. 450  Chapter 9 Laboratory Experiments 9.5  EXPERIMENT 4: COMBINATIONAL CIRCUITS       In this experiment, you will design, construct, and test four combinational logic circuits.       The first two circuits are to be constructed with NAND gates, the third with XOR gates,       and the fourth with a decoder and NAND gates. Reference to a parity generator can be       found in Section 3.9. Implementation with a decoder is discussed in Section 4.9. Design Example             Design a combinational circuit with four inputsA, B, C, and Dand one output, F. F             is to be equal to 1 when A = 1, provided that B = 0, or when B = 1, provided that             either C or D is also equal to 1. Otherwise, the output is to be equal to 0.                 1. Obtain the truth table of the circuit.                 2. Simplify the output function.                 3. Draw the logic diagram of the circuit, using NAND gates with a minimum number                    of ICs.                 4. Construct the circuit and test it for proper operation by verifying the given                    conditions. Majority Logic             A majority logic is a digital circuit whose output is equal to 1 if the majority of the inputs             are 1s. The output is 0 otherwise. Design and test a three\\\\input majority circuit using             NAND gates with a minimum number of ICs. Parity Generator             Design, construct, and test a circuit that generates an even parity bit from four message             bits. Use XOR gates. Adding one more XOR gate, expand the circuit so that it generates             an odd parity bit also. Decoder Implementation             A combinational circuit has three inputsx, y, and zand three outputsF1, F2, and             F3. The simplified Boolean functions for the circuit are                                                          F1 = xz + xyz                                                          F2 = xy + xyz                                                          F3 = xy + xyz             Implement and test the combinational circuit, using a 74155 decoder IC and external             NAND gates.                              Section 9.5 Experiment 4: Combinational Circuits 451    The block diagram of the decoder and its truth table are shown in Fig. 9.7. The 74155 can be connected as a dual 2 * 4 decoder or as a single 3 * 8 decoder. When a 3 * 8 decoder is desired, inputs C1 and C2, as well as inputs G1 and G2, must be connected together, as shown in the block diagram. The function of the circuit is similar to that illustrated in Fig. 4.18. G is the enable input and must be equal to 0 for proper operation. The eight outputs are labeled with symbols given in the data book. The 74155 uses NAND gates, with the result that the selected output goes to 0 while all other outputs remain at 1. The implementation with the decoder is as shown in Fig. 4.21, except that the OR gates must be replaced with external NAND gates when the 74155 is used.                                16                             VCC                  9                  1 C1 2Y0                        10                  15                         2Y1       C                 C2                  2Y2  11       B 3 B 2Y3 12                  13         74155           1Y0  7       A                 A                        6                  2                          1Y1                         G1                       5                                             1Y2       G          14                                  4                        G2                   1Y3                             GND                                8                             Truth table       Inputs                                     Outputs G  C  B       A  2Y0 2Y1 2Y2 2Y3 1Y0 1Y1 1Y2 1Y3 1  X  X       X      1      1               1    1      1  1  1  1 0  0  0       0      0      1               1    1      1  1  1  1 0  0  0       1      1      0               1    1      1  1  1  1 0  0  1       0      1      1               0    1      1  1  1  1 0  0  1       1      1      1               1    0      1  1  1  1 0  1  0       0      1      1               1    1      0  1  1  1 0  1  0       1      1      1               1    1      1  0  1  1 0  1  1       0      1      1               1    1      1  1  0  1 0  1  1       1      1      1               1    1      1  1  1  0 FIGURE 9.7 IC type 74155 connected as a 3 * 8 decoder 452  Chapter 9 Laboratory Experiments 9.6  EXPERIMENT 5: CODE CONVERTERS       The conversion from one binary code to another is common in digital systems. In this       experiment, you will design and construct three combinational\\\\circuit converters. Code       conversion is discussed in Section 4.4. Gray Code to Binary             Design a combinational circuit with four inputs and four outputs that converts a four\\\\             bit Gray code number (Table 1.6) into the equivalent four\\\\bit binary number. Imple-             ment the circuit with exclusive\\\\OR gates. (This can be done with one 7486 IC.)             Connect the circuit to four switches and four indicator lamps, and check for proper             operation. 9s Complementer             Design a combinational circuit with four input lines that represent a decimal digit in             BCD and four output lines that generate the 9s complement of the input digit. Pro-             vide a fifth output that detects an error in the input BCD number. This output should             be equal to logic 1 when the four inputs have one of the unused combinations of the             BCD code. Use any of the gates listed in Fig. 9.1, but minimize the total number of             ICs used. Seven\\\\Segment Display             A seven\\\\segment indicator is used to display any one of the decimal digits 0 through 9.             Usually, the decimal digit is available in BCD. A BCD\\\\to\\\\seven\\\\segment decoder accepts             a decimal digit in BCD and generates the corresponding seven\\\\segment code, as is             shown pictorially in Problem 4.9.                 Figure 9.8 shows the connections necessary between the decoder and the display. The             7447 IC is a BCD\\\\to\\\\seven\\\\segment decoder/driver that has four inputs for the BCD             digit. Input D is the most significant and input A the least significant. The four\\\\bit BCD             digit is converted to a seven\\\\segment code with outputs a through g. The outputs of the             7447 are applied to the inputs of the 7730 (or equivalent) seven\\\\segment display. This             IC contains the seven light\\\\emitting diode (LED) segments on top of the package. The             input at pin 14 is the common anode (CA) for all the LEDs. A 47@ resistor to VCC is             needed in order to supply the proper current to the selected LED segments. Other             equivalent seven\\\\segment display ICs may have additional anode terminals and may             require different resistor values.                 Construct the circuit shown in Fig. 9.8. Apply the four\\\\bit BCD digits through four             switches, and observe the decimal display from 0 to 9. Inputs 1010 through 1111 have             no meaning in BCD. Depending on the decoder, these values may cause either a blank             or a meaningless pattern to be displayed. Observe and record the output patterns of the             six unused input combinations.

The multiplexer to be used is IC type 74151, shown       in Fig. 9.9. The internal construction of the 74151 is similar to the diagram shown in       Fig. 4.25, except that there are eight inputs instead of four. The eight inputs are desig-       nated D0 through D7.The three selection linesC, B, and Aselect the particular input       to be multiplexed and applied to the output. A strobe control S acts as an enable signal.       The function table specifies the value of output Y as a function of the selection lines.       Output W is the complement of Y. For proper operation, the strobe input S must be       connected to ground.

It is necessary to design a circuit that displays the total number of shares that vote yes for each measure. Use a seven\\\\segment display and a decoder, as shown in Fig. 9.8, to display the required number. If all shares vote no for a measure, the display should be blank. (Note that binary input 15 into the 7447 blanks out all seven segments.) If 10 shares vote yes for a measure, the display should show 0. Otherwise, the display shows a decimal number equal to the number of shares that vote yes. Use four 74151 multiplexers to design the combina- tional circuit that converts the inputs from the stock owners switches into the BCD digit for the 7447. Do not use 5 V for logic 1. Use the output of an inverter whose input is grounded. 9.8                               Section 9.8 Experiment 7: Adders and Subtractors 455      EXPERIMENT 7: ADDERS AND SUBTRACTORS       In this experiment, you will construct and test various adder and subtractor circuits. The       subtractor circuit is then used to compare the relative magnitudes of two numbers.       Adders are discussed in Section 4.3. Subtraction with 2s complement is explained in       Section 1.6. A four\\\\bit parallel adderCsubtractor is shown in Fig. 4.13, and the compari-       son of two numbers is explained in Section 4.8.

Full Adder             Design, construct, and test a full\\\\adder circuit using two ICs, 7486 and 7400. Parallel Adder             IC type 7483 is a four\\\\bit binary parallel adder. The pin assignment is shown in Fig. 9.10.             The 2 four\\\\bit input binary numbers are A1 through A4 and B1 through B4.The four\\\\bit             sum is obtained from S1 through S4. C0 is the input carry and C4 the output carry.                 Test the four\\\\bit binary adder 7483 by connecting the power supply and ground ter-             minals. Then connect the four A inputs to a fixed binary number, such as 1001, and the             B inputs and the input carry to five toggle switches.

Perform the addition of a few binary numbers and check that the output             sum and output carry give the proper values. Show that when the input carry is equal             to 1, it adds 1 to the output sum. AdderCSubtractor             Two binary numbers can be subtracted by taking the 2s complement of the subtrahend             and adding it to the minuend. The 2s complement can be obtained by taking the 1s             complement and adding 1.To perform A - B, we complement the four bits of B, add them             to the four bits of A, and add 1 through the input carry. This is done as shown in Fig. 9.11.             The four XOR gates complement the bits of B when the mode select M = 1 (because             x { 1 = x and leave the bits of B unchanged when M = 0 (because x { 0 = x). Thus,             when the mode select M is equal to 1, the input carry C0 is equal to 1 and the sum output             is A plus the 2s complement of B. When M is equal to 0, the input carry is equal to 0 and             the sum generates A + B.                 Connect the adderCsubtractor circuit and test it for proper operation.

Also, show that when A  B, the subtraction operation gives the correct answer,             A - B, and the output carry C4 is equal to 1, but when A 6 B, the subtraction gives             the 2s complement of B - A and the output carry is equal to 0. Magnitude Comparator             The comparison of two numbers is an operation that determines whether one number is             greater than, equal to, or less than the other number. Two numbers, A and B, can be com-             pared by first subtracting A - B as is done in Fig. 9.11. If the output in S is equal to zero,             then A = B. The output carry from C4 determines the relative magnitudes of the num-             bers:When C4 = 1, A  B; when C4 = 0, A 6 B; and when C4 = 1 and S  0, A 7 B.                 It is necessary to supplement the subtractor circuit of Fig. 9.11 to provide the com-             parison logic. This is done with a combinational circuit that has five inputsS1 through             S4 and C4and three outputs, designated by x, y, and z, so that                                      x = 1 if A = B (S = 0000)                                      y = 1 if A 6 B (C4 = 0)                                      z = 1 if A 7 B (C4 = 1 and S  0000)             The combinational circuit can be implemented with the 7404 and 7408 ICs.                 Construct the comparator circuit and test its operation. Use at least two sets of num-             bers for A and B to check each of the outputs x, y, and z. 9.9 EXPERIMENT 8: FLIP\\\\FLOPS             In this experiment, you will construct, test, and investigate the operation of various             latches and flip\\\\flops. The internal construction of latches and flip\\\\flops can be found in             Sections 5.3 and 5.4. SR Latch             Construct an SR latch with two cross\\\\coupled NAND gates. Connect the two inputs to             switches and the two outputs to indicator lamps. Set the two switches to logic 1, and then             momentarily turn each switch separately to the logic\\\\0 position and back to 1. Obtain             the function table of the circuit. D Latch             Construct a D latch with four NAND gates (only one 7400 IC) and verify its function table. MasterCSlave Flip\\\\Flop             Connect a masterCslave D flip\\\\flop using two D latches and an inverter. Connect the             D input to a switch and the clock input to a pulser. Connect the output of the master             latch to one indicator lamp and the output of the slave latch to another indicator             lamp. Set the value of the input to the complement value of the output. Press the push             button in the pulser and then release it to produce a single pulse. Observe that the             master changes when the pulse goes positive and the slave follows the change when             the pulse goes negative. Press the push button again a few times while observing the             two indicator lamps. Explain the transfer sequence from input to master and from             master to slave.                 Disconnect the clock input from the pulser and connect it to a clock generator. Con-             nect the complement output of the flip\\\\flop to the D input. This causes the flip\\\\flop to             be complemented with each clock pulse. Using a dual\\\\trace oscilloscope, observe the             waveforms of the clock and the master and slave outputs. Verify that the delay between             the master and the slave outputs is equal to the positive half of the clock cycle. Obtain             a timing diagram showing the relationship between the clock waveform and the master             and slave outputs.           2                                        7 4 PR 15                       9 PR 11 J            Q                                  J       Q 1                             6                                         VCC  pin 5       CK                            CK                                 GND  pin 13 16                 14         12                      Q 10      K       Q                     K         CLR                                        CLR           3                                        8                              Function table                 Outputs                           Inputs           Preset Clear Clock                    J     K     Q  Q              0         1  X                     XX          1  0              1         0  X                     XX          0  1              0         0  X                     XX          1  1              1         1                        0       0   No change              1         1                        0       1   0  1              1         1                        1       0   1  0              1         1                        1       1      Toggle FIGURE 9.12 IC type 7476 dual JK masterCslave flip\\\\flops                                                              Section 9.9 Experiment 8: Flip\\\\Flops 459 Edge\\\\Triggered Flip\\\\Flop             Construct a D\\\\type positive\\\\edge\\\\triggered flip\\\\flop using six NAND gates. Connect the             clock input to a pulser, the D input to a toggle switch, and the output Q to an indicator             lamp. Set the value of D to the complement of Q. Show that the flip\\\\flop output changes             only in response to a positive transition of the clock pulse. Verify that the output does             not change when the clock input is logic 1, when the clock goes through a negative             transition, or when the clock input is logic 0. Continue changing the D input to corre-             spond to the complement of the Q output at all times.                 Disconnect the input from the pulser and connect it to the clock generator. Connect             the complement output Q to the D input. This causes the output to be complemented             with each positive transition of the clock pulse. Using a dual\\\\trace oscilloscope, observe             and record the timing relationship between the input clock and the output Q.

These inputs behave like a NAND SR latch and are independent             of the clock or the J and K inputs. (The Xs indicate dont\\\\care conditions.) The last four             entries in the function table specify the operation of the clock with both the preset and             clear inputs maintained at logic 1. The clock value is shown as a single pulse. The positive             transition of the pulse changes the master flip\\\\flop, and the negative transition changes             the slave flip\\\\flop as well as the output of the circuit. With J = K = 0, the output does             not change. The flip\\\\flop toggles, or is complemented, when J = K = 1. Investigate the             operation of one 7476 flip\\\\flop and verify its function table.                 IC type 7474 consists of two D positive\\\\edge\\\\triggered flip\\\\flops with preset and             clear. The pin assignment is shown in Fig. 9.13. The function table specifies the preset             and clear operations and the clocks operation. The clock is shown with an upward             arrow to indicate that it is a positive\\\\edge\\\\triggered flip\\\\flop. Investigate the operation             of one of the flip\\\\flops and verify its function table. 9.10 EXPERIMENT 9: SEQUENTIAL CIRCUITS             In this experiment, you will design, construct, and test three synchronous sequential circuits.             Use IC type 7476 (Fig. 9.12) or 7474 (Fig. 9.13). Choose any type of gate that will minimize             the total number of ICs. The design of synchronous sequential circuits is covered in Section 5.7. UpCDown Counter with Enable             Design, construct, and test a two\\\\bit counter that counts up or down. An enable input E             determines whether the counter is on or off. If E = 0, the counter is disabled and remains             at its present count even though clock pulses are applied to the flip\\\\flops. If E = 1, the             counter is enabled and a second input, x, determines the direction of the count. If x = 1,             the circuit counts upward with the sequence 00, 01, 10, 11, and the count repeats. If x = 0,             the circuit counts downward with the sequence 11, 10, 01, 00, and the count repeats. Do             not use E to disable the clock. Design the sequential circuit with E and x as inputs. State Diagram             Design, construct, and test a sequential circuit whose state diagram is shown in Fig. 9.14.             Designate the two flip\\\\flops as A and B, the input as x, and the output as y.                 Connect the output of the least significant flip\\\\flop B to the input x, and predict the             sequence of states and output that will occur with the application of clock pulses. Verify             the state transition and output by testing the circuit. Design of Counter             Design, construct, and test a counter that goes through the following sequence of binary             states: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and back to 0 to repeat. Note that binary states             4, 5, 8, and 9 are not used. The counter must be self\\\\starting; that is, if the circuit starts             from any one of the four invalid states, the count pulses must transfer the circuit to one             of the valid states to continue the count correctly.

Verify that the counter is self\\\\starting. This is done by initializing the circuit to each unused state by means of the preset and clear inputs and then applying pulses to see whether the counter reaches one of the valid states. 9.11 EXPERIMENT 10: COUNTERS             In this experiment, you will construct and test various ripple and synchronous counter             circuits. Ripple counters are discussed in Section 6.3 and synchronous counters are cov-             ered in Section 6.4. Ripple Counter             Construct a four\\\\bit binary ripple counter using two 7476 ICs (Fig. 9.12). Connect all             asynchronous clear and preset inputs to logic 1. Connect the count\\\\pulse input to a             pulser and check the counter for proper operation.                 Modify the counter so that it will count downward instead of upward. Check that             each input pulse decrements the counter by 1. Synchronous Counter             Construct a synchronous four\\\\bit binary counter and check its operation. Use two 7476             ICs and one 7408 IC. Decimal Counter             Design a synchronous BCD counter that counts from 0000 to 1001. Use two 7476 ICs             and one 7408 IC. Test the counter for the proper sequence. Determine whether the             counter is self\\\\starting. This is done by initializing the counter to each of the six unused             states by means of the preset and clear inputs. The application of pulses will transfer the             counter to one of the valid states if the counter is self\\\\starting. Binary Counter with Parallel Load             IC type 74161 is a four\\\\bit synchronous binary counter with parallel load and asyn-             chronous clear. The internal logic is similar to that of the circuit shown in Fig. 6.14.             The pin assignments to the inputs and outputs are shown in Fig. 9.15. When the load             signal is enabled, the four data inputs are transferred into four internal flip\\\\flops, QA             through QD, with QD being the most significant bit. There are two count\\\\enable             inputs called P and T. Both must be equal to 1 for the counter to operate. The function             table is similar to Table 6.6, with one exception: The load input in the 74161 is enabled             when equal to 0. To load the input data, the clear input must be equal to 1 and the             load input must be equal to 0. The two count inputs have dont\\\\care conditions and             may be equal to either 1 or 0. The internal flip\\\\flops trigger on the positive transition             of the clock pulse. The circuit functions as a counter when the load input is equal to             1 and both count inputs P and T are equal to 1. If either P or T goes to 0, the output Data           3                  16                      Data inputs               A        VCC                        outputs  Load          4                                   14  Carry out                      B                    QA  Count  Clock         5                                   13  Clear               C                     QB                6                                   12                      D                     QC                9                                   11                      L                    QD                              74161                7                      P                             15                                       COUT               10                      T        GND                                    8                2                      CK                1                      CLR                     Function table Clear  Clock  Load  Count                              Function          X   0             X         X                      Clear outputs to 0   1             0   1             1         X                      Load input data   1             1                           1                      Count to next binary value                           0                      No change in output FIGURE 9.15 IC type 74161 binary counter with parallel load                                                   Section 9.12 Experiment 11: Shift Registers 463             does not change. The carry\\\\out output is equal to 1 when all four data outputs are             equal to 1. Perform an experiment to verify the operation of the 74161 IC according             to the function table.                 Show how the 74161 IC, together with a two\\\\input NAND gate, can be made to oper-             ate as a synchronous BCD counter that counts from 0000 to 1001. Do not use the clear             input. Use the NAND gate to detect the count of 1001, which then causes all 0s to be             loaded into the counter. 9.12 EXPERIMENT 11: SHIFT REGISTERS             In this experiment, you will investigate the operation of shift registers. The IC to be             used is the 74195 shift register with parallel load. Shift registers are explained in             Section 6.2. IC Shift Register             IC type 74195 is a four\\\\bit shift register with parallel load and asynchronous clear. The             pin assignments to the inputs and outputs are shown in Fig. 9.16. The single control line             labeled SH>LD (shift/load) determines the synchronous operation of the register.When             SH>LD = 0, the control input is in the load mode and the four data inputs are trans-             ferred into the four internal flip\\\\flops, QA through QD.When SH>LD = 1, the control             input is in the shift mode and the information in the register is shifted right from QA             toward QD. The serial input into QA during the shift is determined from the J and K             inputs. The two inputs behave like the J and the complement of K of a JK flip\\\\flop. When             both J and K are equal to 0, flip\\\\flop QA is cleared to 0 after the shift. If both inputs are             equal to 1, QA is set to 1 after the shift. The other two conditions for the J and K inputs             provide a complement or no change in the output of flip\\\\flop QA after the shift.                 The function table for the 74195 shows the mode of operation of the register. When             the clear input goes to 0, the four flip\\\\flops clear to 0 asynchronouslythat is, without             the need of a clock. Synchronous operations are affected by a positive transition of the             clock. To load the input data, SH/LD must be equal to 0 and a positive clock\\\\pulse             transition must occur. To shift right, SH/LD must be equal to 1. The J and K inputs must             be connected together to form the serial input.                 Perform an experiment that will verify the operation of the 74195 IC. Show that it             performs all the operations listed in the function table. Include in your function table             the two conditions for JK = 01 and 10. Ring Counter             A ring counter is a circular shift register with the signal from the serial output QD going             into the serial input. Connect the J and K input together to form the serial input. Use             the load condition to preset the ring counter to an initial value of 1000. Rotate the single             bit with the shift condition and check the state of the register after each clock pulse.                                       16                   1                   VCC         Clear        CLR         Clock    Shift/load     10      Serial              CK      inputs                   9                                   15       Data             SH/LD                  QA      inputs                   2                                   14     Data                        J                      QB            outputs                   3           74195                   13  Complement of QD                        K                      QC                   4                                   12                        A                      QD                   5                                   11                        B                      QD                   6                        C                   7                        D                               GND                                       8                               Function table    Shift/                             Serial Clear load Clock J K input                                       Function 0  X           X     XX                    X     Asynchronous clear                                                  No change in output 1  X           0     XX                    X     Load input data                                                  Shift from QA toward QD, QA  0 1  0                 XX                    X     Shift from QA toward QD, QA  1 1  1                 00                    0 1  1                 11                    1 FIGURE 9.16 IC type 74195 shift register with parallel load    A switch\\\\tail ring counter uses the complement output of QD for the serial input. Preset the switch\\\\tail ring counter to 0000 and predict the sequence of states that will result from shifting. Verify your prediction by observing the state sequence after each shift. Feedback Shift Register             A feedback shift register is a shift register whose serial input is connected to some func-             tion of selected register outputs. Connect a feedback shift register whose serial input is                                                   Section 9.12 Experiment 11: Shift Registers 465             the exclusive\\\\OR of outputs QC and QD. Predict the sequence of states of the register,             starting from state 1000. Verify your prediction by observing the state sequence after             each clock pulse. Bidirectional Shift Register             The 74195 IC can shift only right from QA toward QD. It is possible to convert the             register to a bidirectional shift register by using the load mode to obtain a shift\\\\left             operation (from QD toward QA). This is accomplished by connecting the output of             each flip\\\\flop to the input of the flip\\\\flop on its left and using the load mode of the             SH/LD input as a shift\\\\left control. Input D becomes the serial input for the shift\\\\             left operation.                 Connect the 74195 as a bidirectional shift register (without parallel load). Con-             nect the serial input for shift right to a toggle switch. Construct the shift left as a             ring counter by connecting the serial output QA to the serial input D. Clear the             register and then check its operation by shifting a single 1 from the serial input             switch. Shift right three more times and insert 0s from the serial input switch. Then             rotate left with the shift\\\\left (load) control. The single 1 should remain visible while             shifting. Bidirectional Shift Register with Parallel Load             The 74195 IC can be converted to a bidirectional shift register with parallel load in con-             junction with a multiplexer circuit. We will use IC type 74157 for this purpose. The 74157             is a quadruple two\\\\to\\\\one\\\\line multiplexer whose internal logic is shown in Fig. 4.26. The             pin assignments to the inputs and outputs of the 74157 are shown in Fig. 9.17. Note that             the enable input is called a strobe in the 74157.                 Construct a bidirectional shift register with parallel load using the 74195 register             and the 74157 multiplexer. The circuit should be able to perform the following opera-             tions:                 1. Asynchronous clear                 2. Shift right                 3. Shift left                 4. Parallel load                 5. Synchronous clear             Derive a table for the five operations as a function of the clear, clock, and SH/LD inputs             of the 74195 and the strobe and select inputs of the 74157. Connect the circuit and verify             your function table. Use the parallel\\\\load condition to provide an initial value to the             register, and connect the serial outputs to the serial inputs of both shifts in order not to             lose the binary information while shifting.            2                             16                 A1                    VCC Data       5                                         4 inputs          A2                           Y1   A       11                                         7                 A3                           Y2 Data inputs    14                                         9                 A4                           Y3   B                                                     12       Data   Select                                     Y4             outputs  Strobe            3                          74157                 B1            6                 B2           10 B3           13 B4            1 SEL           15 STB                                       GND                                           8                     Function table Strobe    Select                        Data outputs Y    1        X                         All 0s    0         0                        Select data inputs A    0         1                        Select data inputs B FIGURE 9.17 IC type 74157 quadruple 2 * 1 multiplexers 9.13 EXPERIMENT 12: SERIAL ADDITION             In this experiment, you will construct and test a serial adderCsubtractor circuit. Serial             addition of two binary numbers can be done by means of shift registers and a full adder,             as explained in Section 6.2. Serial Adder             Starting from the diagram of Fig. 6.6, design and construct a four\\\\bit serial adder using             the following ICs: 74195 (two), 7408, 7486, and 7476. Provide a facility for register B to             accept parallel data from four toggle switches, and connect its serial input to ground so             that 0s are shifted into register B during the addition. Provide a toggle switch to clear                                                     Section 9.14 Experiment 13: Memory Unit 467             the registers and the flip\\\\flop. Another switch will be needed to specify whether register             B is to accept parallel data or is to be shifted during the addition. Testing the Adder             To test your serial adder, perform the binary addition 5 + 6 + 15 = 26. This is done by             first clearing the registers and the carry flip\\\\flop. Parallel load the binary value 0101 into             register B.Apply four pulses to add B to A serially, and check that the result in A is 0101.             (Note that clock pulses for the 7476 must be as shown in Fig. 9.12.) Parallel load 0110             into B and add it to A serially. Check that A has the proper sum. Parallel load 1111 into             B and add to A. Check that the value in A is 1010 and that the carry flip\\\\flop is set.                 Clear the registers and flip\\\\flop and try a few other numbers to verify that your serial             adder is functioning properly. Serial AdderCSubtractor             If we follow the procedure used in Section 6.2 for the design of a serial subtractor (that             subtracts A - B), we will find that the output difference is the same as the output sum, but             that the input to the J and K of the borrow flip\\\\flop needs the complement of QD (available             in the 74195). Using the other two XOR gates from the 7486, convert the serial adder to a             serial adderCsubtractor with a mode control M.When M = 0, the circuit adds A + B. When             M = 1, the circuit subtracts A - B and the flip\\\\flop holds the borrow instead of the carry.                 Test the adder part of the circuit by repeating the operations recommended to ensure             that the modification did not change the operation. Test the serial subtractor part by             performing the subtraction 15 - 4 - 5 - 13 = -7. Binary 15 can be transferred to reg-             ister A by first clearing it to 0 and adding 15 from B. Check the intermediate results             during the subtraction. Note that - 7 will appear as the 2s complement of 7 with a bor-             row of 1 in the flip\\\\flop. 9.14 EXPERIMENT 13: MEMORY UNIT             In this experiment, you will investigate the behavior of a random\\\\access memory (RAM)             unit and its storage capability. The RAM will be used to simulate a read\\\\only memory             (ROM). The ROM simulator will then be used to implement combinational circuits, as             explained in Section 7.5. The memory unit is discussed in Sections 7.2 and 7.3. IC RAM             IC type 74189 is a 16 * 4 RAM. The internal logic is similar to the circuit shown in Fig. 7.6             for a 4 * 4 RAM. The pin assignments to the inputs and outputs are shown in Fig. 9.18.             The four address inputs select 1 of 16 words in the memory. The least significant bit of the             address is A and the most significant is A3. The chip select (CS) input must be equal to 0             to enable the memory. If CS is equal to 1, the memory is disabled and all four outputs are             in a high\\\\impedance state.The write enable (WE) input determines the type of operation,             as indicated in the function table. The write operation is performed when WE = 0.

This operation transfers the complemented value stored in the selected word into the output data lines. The memory has three\\\\state outputs to facilitate memory expansion. Testing the RAM             Since the outputs of the 74189 produce the complemented values, we need to insert four             inverters to change the outputs to their normal value. The RAM can be tested after             making the following connections: Connect the address inputs to a binary counter using             the 7493 IC (shown in Fig. 9.3). Connect the four data inputs to toggle switches and the                                                  Section 9.15 Experiment 14: Lamp Handball 469             data outputs to four 7404 inverters. Provide four indicator lamps for the address and             four more for the outputs of the inverters. Connect input CS to ground and WE to a             toggle switch (or a pulser that provides a negative pulse). Store a few words into the             memory, and then read them to verify that the write and read operations are functioning             properly. You must be careful when using the WE switch. Always leave the WE input in             the read mode, unless you want to write into memory. The proper way to write is first to             set the address in the counter and the inputs in the four toggle switches. Then, store the             word in memory, flip the WE switch to the write position and return it to the read posi-             tion. Be careful not to change the address or the inputs when WE is in the write mode. ROM Simulator             A ROM simulator is obtained from a RAM operated in the read mode only. The pattern             of 1s and 0s is first entered into the simulating RAM by placing the unit momentarily             in the write mode. Simulation is achieved by placing the unit in the read mode and tak-             ing the address lines as inputs to the ROM. The ROM can then be used to implement             any combinational circuit.                 Implement a combinational circuit using the ROM simulator that converts a four\\\\bit             binary number to its equivalent Gray code as defined in Table 1.6.This is done as follows:             Obtain the truth table of the code converter. Store the truth table into the 74189 mem-             ory by setting the address inputs to the binary value and the data inputs to the corre-             sponding Gray code value. After all 16 entries of the table are written into memory, the             ROM simulator is set by permanently connecting the WE line to logic 1. Check the code             converter by applying the inputs to the address lines and verifying the correct outputs             in the data output lines. Memory Expansion             Expand the memory unit to a 32 * 4 RAM using two 74189 ICs. Use the CS inputs to             select between the two ICs. Note that since the data outputs are three\\\\stated, you can             tie pairs of terminals together to obtain a logic OR operation between the two ICs. Test             your circuit by using it as a ROM simulator that adds a three\\\\bit number to a two\\\\bit             number to produce a four\\\\bit sum. For example, if the input of the ROM is 10110, then             the output is calculated to be 101 + 10 = 0111. (The first three bits of the input repre-             sent 5, the last two bits represent 2, and the output sum is binary 7.) Use the counter to             provide four bits of the address and a switch for the fifth bit of the address. 9.15 EXPERIMENT 14: LAMP HANDBALL             In this experiment, you will construct an electronic game of handball, using a single light             to simulate the moving ball. The experiment demonstrates the application of a bidirec-             tional shift register with parallel load. It also shows the operation of the asynchronous             inputs of flip\\\\flops. We will first introduce an IC that is needed for the experiment and             then present the logic diagram of the simulated lamp handball game. IC Type 74194             This is a four\\\\bit bidirectional shift register with parallel load. The internal logic is sim-             ilar to that shown in Fig. 6.7. The pin assignments to the inputs and outputs are shown             in Fig. 9.19. The two mode\\\\control inputs determine the type of operation, as specified             in the function table. Logic Diagram             The logic diagram of the electronic lamp handball game is shown in Fig. 9.20. It consists             of two 74194 ICs, a dual D flip\\\\flop 7474 IC, and three gate ICs: the 7400, 7404, and             7408.

The rate at which the light moves is determined by the fre-             quency of the clock. The circuit is first initialized with the reset switch. The start switch             starts the game by placing the ball (an indicator lamp) at the extreme right. The player             must press the pulser push button to start the ball moving to the left. The single light             shifts to the left until it reaches the leftmost position (the wall), at which time the ball             returns to the player by reversing the direction of shift of the moving light. When the             light is again at the rightmost position, the player must press the pulser again to reverse             the direction of shift. If the player presses the pulser too soon or too late, the ball dis-             appears and the light goes off. The game can be restarted by turning the start switch             on and then off. The start switch must be open (logic 1) during the game. Circuit Analysis             Prior to connecting the circuit, analyze the logic diagram to ensure that you understand             how the circuit operates. In particular, try to answer the following questions:                 1. What is the function of the reset switch?                 2. How does the light in the rightmost position come on when the start switch is                     grounded? Why is it necessary to place the start switch in the logic\\\\1 position                     before the game starts?                 3. What happens to the two mode\\\\control inputs, S1 and S0, once the ball is set in                     motion?                 4. What happens to the mode\\\\control inputs and to the ball if the pulser is pressed                     while the ball is moving to the left? What happens if the ball is moving to the right,                     but has not yet reached the rightmost position?                 5. If the ball has returned to the rightmost position, but the pulser has not yet been                     pressed, what is the state of the mode\\\\control inputs if the pulser is pressed? What                     happens if it is not pressed? Playing the Game             Wire the circuit of Fig. 9.20.Test the circuit for proper operation by playing the game. Note             that the pulser must provide a positive\\\\edge transition and that both the reset and start             switches must be open (i.e., must be in the logic\\\\1 state) during the game. Start with a low             clock rate, and increase the clock frequency to make the handball game more challenging. Counting the Number of Losses             Design a circuit that keeps score of the number of times the player loses while playing             the game. Use a BCD\\\\to\\\\seven\\\\segment decoder and a seven\\\\segment display, as in             Fig. 9.8, to display the count from 0 through 9. Counting is done with either the 7493 as             a ripple decimal counter or the 74161 and a NAND gate as a synchronous decimal             counter. The display should show 0 when the circuit is reset. Every time the ball disap-             pears and the light goes off, the display should increase by 1. If the light stays on during             the play, the number in the display should not change. The final design should be an                                        Section 9.16 Experiment 15: Clock\\\\Pulse Generator 473             automatic scoring circuit, with the decimal display incremented automatically each time             the player loses when the light disappears. Lamp Ping\\\\Pong             Modify the circuit of Fig. 9.20 so as to obtain a lamp Ping\\\\Pong game. Two players can             participate in this game, with each player having his or her own pulser. The player with             the right pulser returns the ball when it is in the extreme right position, and the player             with the left pulser returns the ball when it is in the extreme left position. The only mod-             ification required for the Ping\\\\Pong game is a second pulser and a change of a few wires.                 With a second start circuit, the game can be made to start by either one of the two             players (i.e., either one serves). This addition is optional. 9.16 EXPERIMENT 15: CLOCK\\\\PULSE GENERATOR             In this experiment, you will use an IC timer unit and connect it to produce clock pulses             at a given frequency. The circuit requires the connection of two external resistors and             two external capacitors. The cathode\\\\ray oscilloscope is used to observe the waveforms             and measure the frequency of the pulses. IC Timer IC type 72555 (or 555) is a precision timer circuit whose internal logic is shown in Fig. 9.21. (The resistors, RA and RB, and the two capacitors are not part of the IC.) The circuit con- sists of two voltage comparators, a flip\\\\flop, and an internal transistor. The voltage division from      VCC  =  5 V  through  the  three  internal  resistors  to  ground  produces  2  and  1  of  VCC                                                                                        3       3 (3.3 V and 1.7 V, respectively) into the fixed inputs of the comparators. When the threshold input at pin 6 goes above 3.3 V, the upper comparator resets the flip\\\\flop and the output goes low to about 0 V. When the trigger input at pin 2 goes below 1.7 V, the lower com- parator sets the flip\\\\flop and the output goes high to about 5 V. When the output is low, Q is high and the baseCemitter junction of the transistor is forward biased. When the output is high, Q is low and the transistor is cut off. (See Section 10.3.) The timer circuit is capable of producing accurate time delays controlled by an external RC circuit. In this experiment, the IC timer will be operated in the astable mode to produce clock pulses. Circuit Operation             Figure 9.21 shows the external connections for astable operation of the circuit. Capacitor             C charges through resistors RA and RB when the transistor is cut off and discharges through             RB when the transistor is forward biased and conducting.When the charging voltage across             capacitor C reaches 3.3 V, the threshold input at pin 6 causes the flip\\\\flop to reset and the             transistor turns on. When the discharging voltage reaches 1.7 V, the trigger input at pin 2             causes the flip\\\\flop to set and the transistor turns off. Thus, the output continually alternates                                     5 V                               0.01 f                      VCC 8 5             Reset 4                   6                                                   RA Threshold                                                               3                               Compare    R                 Q                Output                                          S                 Q  7                                                                       Discharge Trigger 2                     Compare                                 RB                                               72555 Timer             C GND 1                   FIGURE 9.21                   IC type 72555 timer connected as a clock\\\\pulse generator             between two voltage levels at the output of the flip\\\\flop. The output remains high for a             duration equal to the charge time. This duration is determined from the equation                                                      tH = 0.693(RA + RB)C             The output remains low for a duration equal to the discharge time. This duration is             determined from the equation                                                            tL = 0.693RBC Clock\\\\Pulse Generator             Starting with a capacitor C of 0.001 F calculate values for RA and RB to produce clock             pulses, as shown in Fig. 9.22. The pulse width is 1 s in the low level and repeats at a       Section 9.17 Experiment 16: Parallel Adder and Accumulator 475                                                          1 S                                                                   10 S       FIGURE 9.22       Output waveform for clock generator       frequency rate of 100 kHz (every 10 s). Connect the circuit and check the output in the       oscilloscope.          Observe the output across the capacitor C, and record its two levels to verify that       they are between the trigger and threshold values.          Observe the waveform in the collector of the transistor at pin 7 and record all perti-       nent information. Explain the waveform by analyzing the circuits action.          Connect a variable resistor (potentiometer) in series with RA to produce a variable\\\\       frequency pulse generator. The low\\\\level duration remains at 1 s The frequency should       range from 20 to 100 kHz.          Change the low\\\\level pulses to high\\\\level pulses with a 7404 inverter. This will pro-       duce positive pulses of 1 s with a variable\\\\frequency range. 9.17  EXPERIMENT 16: PARALLEL ADDER       AND ACCUMULATOR       In this experiment, you will construct a four\\\\bit parallel adder whose sum can be loaded       into a register. The numbers to be added will be stored in a RAM. A set of binary       numbers will be selected from memory and their sum will be accumulated in the register. Block Diagram             Use the RAM circuit from the memory experiment of Section 9.14, a four\\\\bit parallel             adder, a four\\\\bit shift register with parallel load, a carry flip\\\\flop, and a multiplexer to             construct the circuit. The block diagram and the ICs to be used are shown in Fig. 9.23.             Information can be written into RAM from data in four switches or from the four\\\\bit             data available in the outputs of the register. The selection is done by means of a multi-             plexer. The data in RAM can be added to the contents of the register and the sum             transferred back to the register. Control of Register             Provide toggle switches to control the 74194 register and the 7476 carry flip\\\\flop as follows:               (a) A LOAD condition transfers the sum to the register and the output carry to the                    flip\\\\flop upon the application of a clock pulse.

The value in the carry flip\\\\flop should not change during the                     shift.               (c) A NO\\\\CHANGE condition leaves the contents of the register and flip\\\\flop                    unchanged even when clock pulses are applied. Carry Circuit             To conform with the preceding specifications, it is necessary to provide a circuit between             the output carry from the adder and the J and K inputs of the 7476 flip\\\\flop so that the             output carry is transferred into the flip\\\\flop (whether it is equal to 0 or 1) only when the             LOAD condition is activated and a pulse is applied to the clock input of the flip\\\\flop.             The carry flip\\\\flop should not change if the LOAD condition is disabled or the SHIFT             condition is enabled.                           Section 9.17 Experiment 16: Parallel Adder and Accumulator 477 Detailed Circuit             Draw a detailed diagram showing all the wiring between the ICs. Connect the circuit,             and provide indicator lamps for the outputs of the register and carry flip\\\\flop and for             the address and output data of the RAM. Checking the Circuit             Store the numbers 0110, 1110, 1101, 0101, and 0011 in RAM and then add them to the             register one at a time. Start with a cleared register and flip\\\\flop. Predict the values in             the output of the register and carry after each addition in the following sum, and verify             your results:                                             0110 + 1110 + 1101 + 0101 + 0011 Circuit Operation             Clear the register and the carry flip\\\\flop to zero, and store the following four\\\\bit num-             bers in RAM in the indicated addresses: Address  Content      0     0110      3     1110      6     1101      9     0101    12      0011 Now perform the following four operations:    1. Add the contents of address 0 to the contents of the register, using the LOAD        condition.    2. Store the sum from the register into RAM at address 1.    3. Shift right the contents of the register and carry with the SHIFT condition.    4. Store the shifted contents of the register at address 2 of RAM. Check that the contents of the first three locations in RAM are as follows: Address  Contents     0      0110     1      0110     2      0011    Repeat the foregoing four operations for each of the other four binary numbers stored in RAM. Use addresses 4, 7, 10, and 13 to store the sum from the register in step 2.             Use addresses 5, 8, 11, and 14 to store the shifted value from the register in step 4. Predict             what the contents of RAM at addresses 0 through 14 would be, and check to verify your             results. 9.18 EXPERIMENT 17: BINARY MULTIPLIER             In this experiment, you will design and construct a circuit that multiplies 2 four\\\\bit             unsigned numbers to produce an eight\\\\bit product. An algorithm for multiplying two             binary numbers is presented in Section 8.7. The algorithm implemented in this experi-             ment differs from the one described in Figs. 8.14 and 8.15, by treating only a four\\\\bit             datapath and by incrementing, instead of decrementing, a bit counter. Block Diagram             The ASMD chart and block diagram of the binary multiplier with those ICs recom-             mended to be used are shown in Fig. 9.24(a) and (b). The multiplicand, B, is available             from four switches instead of a register. The multiplier, Q, is obtained from another set             of four switches. The product is displayed with eight indicator lamps. Counter P is             initialized to 0 and then incremented after each partial product is formed. When the             counter reaches the count of four, output Done becomes 1 and the multiplication             operation terminates. Control of Registers             The ASMD chart for the binary multiplier in Fig. 9.24(a) shows that the three registers             and the carry flip\\\\flop of the datapath unit are controlled with signals Load_regs,             Incr_P, Add_regs, and Shift_regs. The external input signals of the control unit are             clock, reset_b (active\\\\low), and Start; another input to the control unit is the internal             status signal, Done, which is formed by the datapath unit to indicate that the counter             has reached a count of four, corresponding to the number of bits in the multiplier.             Load_regs clears the product register (A) and the carry flip\\\\flop (C), loads the mul-             tiplicand into register B, loads the multiplier into register Q, and clears the bit coun-             ter. Incr_P increments the bit counter concurrently with the accumulation of a partial             product. Add_regs adds the multiplicand to A, if the least significant bit of the shifted             multiplier (Q[0]) is 1. Flip\\\\flop C accommodates a carry that results from the addition.             The concatenated register CAQ is updated by storing the result of shifting its contents             one bit to the right. Shift_regs shifts CAQ one bit to the right, which also clears flip\\\\             flop C.                 The state diagram for the control unit is shown in Fig. 9.24(c). Note that it does not             show the register operations of the datapath unit or the output signals that control             them. That information is apparent in Fig. 9.24(d). Note that Incr_P and Shift_regs are             generated unconditionally in states S_add and S_shift, respectively. Load_regs is                                                Section 9.18 Experiment 17: Binary Multiplier 479             generated under the condition that Start is asserted conditionally while the state is in             S_idle; Add_regs is asserted conditionally in S_add if Q[0] = 1. Multiplication Example             Before connecting the circuit, make sure that you understand the operation of the             multiplier. To do this, construct a table similar to Table 8.5, but with B = 1111 for the             multiplicand and Q = 1011 for the multiplier. Along with each comment listed on             the left side of the table, specify the state. Datapath Design             Draw a detailed diagram of the datapath part of the multiplier, showing all IC pin con-             nections. Generate the four control signals with switches, and use them to provide the             required control operations for the various registers. Connect the circuit and check that             each component is functioning properly. With the control signals at 0, set the multipli-             cand switches to 1111 and the multiplier switches to 1011. Assert the control signals             manually by means of the control switches, as specified by the state diagram of             Fig. 9.24(c). Apply a single pulse while in each control state, and observe the outputs of             registers A and Q and the values in C and P. Compare these outputs with the numbers             in your numerical example to verify that the circuit is functioning properly. Note that IC             type 74161 has masterCslave flip\\\\flops. To operate it manually, it is necessary that the             single clock pulse be a negative pulse. Design of Control             Design the control circuit specified by the state diagram. You can use any method of             control implementation discussed in Section 8.8.                 Choose the method that minimizes the number of ICs. Verify the operation of the             control circuit prior to its connection to the datapath unit. Checking the Multiplier             Connect the outputs of the control circuit to the datapath unit, and verify the total circuit             operation by repeating the steps of multiplying 1111 by 1011. The single clock pulses             should now sequence the control states as well. (Remove the manual switches.) The start             signal (Start) can be generated with a switch that is on while the control is in state S_idle.                 Generate the start signal (Start) with a pulser or any other short pulse, and operate the             multiplier with continuous clock pulses from a clock generator. Pressing the pulser for             Start should initiate the multiplication operation, and upon its completion, the product             should be displayed in the A and Q registers. Note that the multiplication will be repeated             as long as signal Start is enabled. Make sure that Start goes back to 0. Then set the switches             to two other four\\\\bit numbers and press Start again. The new product should appear at the             outputs. Repeat the multiplication of a few numbers to verify the operation of the circuit.

Once the HDL model is verified, the description is synthesized and mapped into             the FPGA. FPGA vendors provide software tools for synthesizing the HDL description             of a circuit into an optimized gate\\\\level description and mapping (fitting) the resulting             netlist into the resources of their FPGA. This process avoids the detailed assembly of ICs             that is required by composing a circuit on a breadboard, and the process involves sig-             nificantly less risk of failure, because it is easier and faster to edit an HDL description             than to re\\\\wire a breadboard.                 Most of the hardware experiments outlined in this chapter can be supplemented by             a corresponding software procedure using the Verilog hardware description language             (HDL). A Verilog compiler and simulator are necessary for these supplements. The             supplemental experiments have two levels of engagement. In the first, the circuits that             are specified in the hands\\\\on laboratory experiments can be described, simulated, and             verified using Verilog and a simulator. In the second, if a suitable FPGA prototyping             board is available (e.g., see www.digilentinc.com), the hardware experiments can be             done by synthesizing the Verilog descriptions and implementing the circuits in an FPGA.             Where appropriate, the identity of the individual (structural) hardware units (e.g., a 4\\\\bit             counter) can be preserved by encapsulating them in separate Verilog modules whose             internal detail is described behaviorally or by a mixture of behavioral and structural             models.                 Prototyping a circuit with an FPGA requires synthesizing a Verilog description to             produce a bit stream that can be downloaded to configure the internal resources             (e.g., CLBS of a Xilinx FPGA) and connectivity of the FPGA. Three details require             attention: (1) The pins of the prototyping board are connected to the pins of the FPGA,             and the hardware implementation of the synthesized circuit requires that its input and             output signals be associated with the pins of the prototyping board (this association is             made using the synthesis tool provided by the vendor of the FPGA (such tools are avail-             able free)), (2) FPGA prototyping boards have a clock generator, but it will be necessary,             in some cases, to implement a clock divider (in Verilog) to obtain an internal clock             whose frequency is suitable for the experiment, and (3) inputs to an FPGA\\\\based circuit             can be made using switches and pushbuttons located on the prototyping board, but it             might be necessary to implement a pulser circuit in software to control and observe the             activity of a counter or a state machine (see the supplement to Experiment 1). Supplement to Experiment 1 (Section 9.2)             The functionality of the counters specified in Experiment 1 can be described in Verilog             and synthesized for implementation in an FPGA. Note that the circuit shown in Fig. 9.3             uses a push\\\\button pulser or a clock to cause the count to increment in a circuit built             with standard ICs. A software pulser circuit can be developed to work with a switch on             the prototyping board of an FPGA so that the operation of the counters can be verified             by visual inspection.                 The software pulser has the ASM chart shown in Fig. 9.25, where the external input             (Pushed) is obtained from a mechanical switch or pushbutton. This circuit asserts Start             for one cycle of the clock and then waits for the switch to be opened (or the pushbutton                                           Section 9.19 Verilog HDL Simulation Experiments 483                                                                              reset_b                                                                              S_idle                                                                              pushed                                                                                1                                                                              S_ pulse                                                                              Start                                                                             S_Awa2it                                                                                           1                                                                              Pushed                   FIGURE 9.25                   Pulser circuit for FPGA implementation of Experiment 1             to be released) to ensure that each action of the switch or pushbutton will produce only             one pulse of Start. If the counter, or a state machine, is in the reset state (S_idle) when             the switch is closed, the pulse will launch the activity of the counter or state machine. It             will be necessary to open the switch (or release the pushbutton) before Start can be             reasserted. Using the software pulser will allow each value of the count to be observed.             If necessary, a simple synchronizer circuit can be used with Pushed. Supplement to Experiment 2 (Section 9.3)             The various logic gates and their propagation delays were introduced in the hardware             experiment. In Section 3.10, a simple circuit with gate delays was investigated. As an             introduction to the laboratory Verilog program, compile the circuit described in HDL             Example 3.3 and then run the simulator to verify the waveforms shown in Fig. 3.38.                 Assign the following delays to the exclusive\\\\OR circuit shown in Fig. 3.32(a): 10 ns             for an inverter, 20 ns for an AND gate, and 30 ns for an OR gate. The input of the circuit             goes from xy = 00 to xy = 01.               (a) Determine the signals at the output of each gate from t = 0 to t = 50 ns.

Supplement to Experiment 4 (Section 9.5)             The operation of a combinational circuit is verified by checking the output and compar-             ing it with the truth table for the circuit. HDL Example 4.10 (Section 4.12) demonstrates             the procedure for obtaining the truth table of a combinational circuit by simulating it.               (a) In order to get acquainted with this procedure, compile and simulate HDL                     Example 4.10 and check the output truth table.               (b) In Experiment 4, you designed a majority logic circuit. Write the HDL gate\\\\level                     description of the majority logic circuit together with a stimulus for displaying the                     truth table. Compile and simulate the circuit and check the output response.               (c) Implement the majority logic circuit units in an FPGA and test its operation. Supplement to Experiment 5 (Section 9.6)             This experiment deals with code conversion. A BCD\\\\to\\\\excess\\\\3 converter was designed             in Section 4.4. Use the result of the design to check it with an HDL simulator.               (a) Write an HDL gate\\\\level description of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.4.               (b) Write a dataflow description using the Boolean expressions listed in Fig. 4.3.               (c) Write an HDL behavioral description of a BCD\\\\to\\\\excess\\\\3 converter.               (d) Write a test bench to simulate and test the BCD\\\\to\\\\excess\\\\3 converter circuit in                     order to verify the truth table. Check all three circuits.               (e) Implement the behavioral description with an FPGA and test the operation of the                     circuit. Supplement to Experiment 7 (Section 9.8)             A four\\\\bit adderCsubtractor is developed in this experiment. An adderCsubtractor cir-             cuit is also developed in Section 4.5.               (a) Write the HDL behavioral description of the 7483 four\\\\bit adder.               (b) Write a behavioral description of the adderCsubtractor circuit shown in Fig. 9.11.               (c) Write the HDL hierarchical description of the four\\\\bit adderCsubtractor shown in                     Fig. 4.13 (including V). This can be done by instantiating a modified version of the                     four\\\\bit adder described in HDL Example 4.2 (Section 4.12).               (d) Write an HDL test bench to simulate and test the circuits of part (c). Check and                     verify the values that cause an overflow with V = 1.               (e) Implement the circuit of part (c) with an FPGA and test its operation.                                           Section 9.19 Verilog HDL Simulation Experiments 485 Supplement to Experiment 8 (Section 9.9)             The edge\\\\triggered D flip\\\\flop 7474 is shown in Fig. 9.13. The flip\\\\flop has asynchronous             preset and clear inputs.               (a) Write an HDL behavioral description of the 7474 D flip\\\\flop, using only the Q                    output. (Note that when Preset = 0, Q goes to 1, and when Preset = 1 and                     Clear = 0, Q goes to 0. Thus, Preset takes precedence over Clear.)               (b) Write an HDL behavioral description of the 7474 D flip\\\\flop, using both outputs.                    Label the second output Q_not, and note that this is not always the complement                    of Q. (When Preset = Clear = 0, both Q and Q_not go to 1.) Supplement to Experiment 9 (Section 9.10)             In this hardware experiment, you are asked to design and test a sequential circuit whose             state diagram is given by Fig. 9.14. This is a Mealy model sequential circuit similar to the             one described in HDL Example 5.5 (Section 5.6).               (a) Write the HDL description of the state diagram of Fig. 9.14.               (b) Write the HDL structural description of the sequential circuit obtained from the                    design. (This is similar to HDL Example 5.7 in Section 5.6.)               (c) Figure 9.24(c) (Section 9.18) shows a control state diagram.Write the HDL descrip-                    tion of the state diagram, using the one\\\\hot binary assignment (see Table 5.9 in                    Section 5.7) and four outputsT0, T1, T2, and T3.               (d) Write a behavioral model of the datapath unit, and verify that the interconnected                    control unit and datapath unit operate correctly.               (e) Implement the integrated circuit with an FPGA and test its operation. Supplement to Experiment 10 (Section 9.11)             The synchronous counter with parallel load IC type 74161 is shown in Fig. 9.15. This             circuit is similar to the one described in HDL Example 6.3 (Section 6.6), with two excep-             tions:The load input is enabled when equal to 0, and there are two inputs (P and T) that             control the count. Write the HDL description of the 74161 IC. Implement the counter             with an FPGA and test its operation. Supplement to Experiment 11 (Section 9.12)             A bidirectional shift register with parallel load is designed in this experiment by using             the 74195 and 74157 IC types.               (a) Write the HDL description of the 74195 shift register. Assume that inputs J and K                     are connected together to form the serial input.               (b) Write the HDL description of the 74157 multiplexer.               (c) Obtain the HDL description of the four\\\\bit bidirectional shift register that has                     been designed in this experiment. (1) Write the structural description by instanti-                     ating the two ICs and specifying their interconnection, and (2) write the behav-                     ioral description of the circuit, using the function table that is derived in this design                     experiment.               (d) Implement the circuit with an FPGA and test its operation. Supplement to Experiment 13 (Section 9.14)             This experiment investigates the operation of a random\\\\access memory (RAM). The             way a memory is described in HDL is explained in Section 7.2 in conjunction with HDL             Example 7.1.               (a) Write the HDL description of IC type 74189 RAM, shown in Fig. 9.18.               (b) Test the operation of the memory by writing a stimulus program that stores bi-                     nary 3 in address 0 and binary 1 in address 14. Then read the stored numbers from                     the two addresses to check whether the numbers were stored correctly.               (c) Implement the RAM with an FPGA and test its operation. Supplement to Experiment 14 (Section 9.15)               (a) Write the HDL behavioral description of the 74194 bidirectional shift register with                     parallel load shown in Fig. 9.19.               (b) Implement the shift register with an FPGA and test its operation. Supplement to Experiment 16 (Section 9.17)             A parallel adder with an accumulator register and a memory unit is shown in the block             diagram of Fig. 9.23. Write the structural description of the circuit specified by the             block diagram. The HDL structural description of this circuit can be obtained by             instantiating the various components. An example of a structural description of a             design can be found in HDL Example 8.4 in Section 8.6. First, it is necessary to write             the behavioral description of each component. Use counter 74161 instead of 7493, and             substitute the D flip\\\\flop 7474 instead of the JK flip\\\\flop 7476. The block diagram of             the various components can be found from the list in Table 9.1. Write a test bench for             each model, and then write a test bench to verify the entire design. Implement the             circuit with an FPGA and test its operation. Supplement to Experiment 17 (Section 9.18)             The block diagram of a four\\\\bit binary multiplier is shown in Fig. 9.24. The multiplier             can be described in one of two ways: (1) by using the register transfer level statements             listed in part (b) of the figure or (2) by using the block diagram shown in part (a) of the                              Section 9.19 Verilog HDL Simulation Experiments 487 figure. The description of the multiplier in terms of the register transfer level (RTL) format is carried out in HDL Example 8.5 (Section 8.7).  (a) Use the integrated circuit components specified in the block diagram to write the        HDL structural description of the binary multiplier. The structural description is        obtained by using the module description of each component and then instantiating        all the components to show how they are interconnected. (See Section 8.5 for an        example.) The HDL descriptions of the components may be available from the        solutions to previous experiments. The 7483 is described with a solution to        Experiment 7(a), the 7474 with Experiment 8(a), the 74161 with Experiment 10,        and the 74194 with Experiment 14. The description of the control is available from        a solution to Experiment 9(c). Be sure to verify each structural unit before        attempting to verify the multiplier.  (b) Implement the binary multiplier with an FPGA. Use the pulser described in the        supplement to Experiment 1. Chapter 10 Standard Graphic Symbols 10.1 RECTANGULAR\\\\SHAPE SYMBOLS             Digital components such as gates, decoders, multiplexers, and registers are available             commercially in integrated circuits and are classified as SSI or MSI circuits. Standard             graphic symbols have been developed for these and other components so that the user             can recognize each function from the unique graphic symbol assigned to it. This stan-             dard, known as ANSI/IEEE Std. 91\\\\1984, has been approved by industry, government,             and professional organizations and is consistent with international standards.                 The standard uses a rectangular\\\\shape outline to represent each particular logic func-             tion. Within the outline, there is a general qualifying symbol denoting the logical operation             performed by the unit. For example, the general qualifying symbol for a multiplexer is             MUX. The size of the outline is arbitrary and can be either a square or a rectangular shape             with an arbitrary lengthCwidth ratio. Input lines are placed on the left and output lines are             placed on the right. If the direction of signal flow is reversed, it must be indicated by arrows.                 The rectangular\\\\shape graphic symbols for SSI gates are shown in Fig. 10.1. The             qualifying symbol for the AND gate is the ampersand (&). The OR gate has the qualify-             ing symbol that designates greater than or equal to 1, indicating that at least one input             must be active for the output to be active. The symbol for the buffer gate is 1, showing             that only one input is present. The exclusive\\\\OR symbol designates the fact that only             one input must be active for the output to be active. The inclusion of the logic negation             small circle in the output converts the gates to their complement values. Although the             rectangular\\\\shape symbols for the gates are recommended, the standard also recognizes             the distinctive\\\\shape symbols for the gates shown in Fig. 2.5.                 An example of an MSI standard graphic symbol is the four\\\\bit parallel adder shown             in Fig. 10.2. The qualifying symbol for an adder is the Greek letter .

The bit\\\\grouping symbols in the two types of inputs and the sum output are the decimal equivalents of the weights of the bits to the power of 2. Thus, the input labeled 3 corresponds to the value of 23 = 8. The input carry is designated by CI and the output carry by CO. When the digital compo- nent represented by the outline is also a commercial integrated circuit, it is customary to write the IC pin number along each input and output. Thus, IC type 7483 is a four\\\\bit adder with look\\\\ahead carry. It is enclosed in a package with 16 pins. The pin numbers             for the nine inputs and five outputs are shown in Fig. 10.2. The other two pins are for             the power supply.                 Before introducing the graphic symbols of other components, it is necessary to review             some terminology. As mentioned in Section 2.8, a positive\\\\logic system defines the more             positive of two signal levels (designated by H) as logic 1 and the more negative signal             level (designated by L) as logic 0. Negative logic assumes the opposite assignment.             A third alternative is to employ a mixed\\\\logic convention, where the signals are consid-             ered entirely in terms of their H and L values. At any point in the circuit, the user is             allowed to define the logic polarity by assigning logic 1 to either the H or L signal. The             mixed\\\\logic notation uses a small right\\\\angle\\\\triangle graphic symbol to designate a             negative\\\\logic polarity at any input or output terminal. (See Fig. 2.10(f).)                 Integrated\\\\circuit manufacturers specify the operation of integrated circuits in terms of             H and L signals. When an input or output is considered in terms of positive logic, it is defined             as active high. When it is considered in terms of negative logic, it is defined as active low.             Active\\\\low inputs or outputs are recognized by the presence of the small\\\\triangle polarity\\\\             indicator symbol. When positive logic is used exclusively throughout the entire system, the             small\\\\triangle polarity symbol is equivalent to the small circle that designates negation. In             this book, we have assumed positive logic throughout and employed the small circle when             drawing logic diagrams. When an input or output line does not include the small circle, we             define it to be active if it is logic 1. An input or output that includes the small\\\\circle symbol             is considered active if it is in the logic\\\\0 state. However, we will use the small\\\\triangle             polarity symbol to indicate active\\\\low assignment in all drawings that represent standard             diagrams. This will conform with integrated\\\\circuit data books, where the polarity symbol             is usually employed. Note that the bottom four gates in Fig. 10.1 could have been drawn             with a small triangle in the output lines instead of a small circle.                 Another example of a graphic symbol for an MSI circuit is shown in Fig. 10.3. This             is a 2\\\\to\\\\4\\\\line decoder representing one\\\\half of IC type 74155. Inputs are on the left             and outputs on the right. The identifying symbol X/Y indicates that the circuit converts             from code X to code Y. Data inputs A and B are assigned binary weights 1 and 2             equivalent to 20 and 21, respectively. The outputs are assigned numbers from 0 to 3,             corresponding to outputs D0 through D3, respectively. The decoder has one active\\\\low             input E1 and one active\\\\high input E2. These two inputs go through an internal AND    13 X/Y A               1                             7    3                     0     D0 B               2                          1 6 D1              2           2 5 D2 E1                    & EN  3  4  D3              1 E2 FIGURE 10.3 Standard graphic symbol for a 2\\\\to\\\\4\\\\line decoder (one\\\\half of IC type 74155)                                                      Section 10.2 Qualifying Symbols 491 gate to enable the decoder. The output of the AND gate is labeled EN (enable) and is activated when E1 is at a low\\\\level state and E2 at a high\\\\level state. 10.2 QUALIFYING SYMBOLS             The IEEE standard graphic symbols for logic functions provide a list of qualifying symbols             to be used in conjunction with the outline. A qualifying symbol is added to the basic outline             to designate the overall logic characteristics of the element or the physical characteristics             of an input or output. Table 10.1 lists some of the general qualifying symbols specified in             the standard. A general qualifying symbol defines the basic function performed by the             device represented in the diagram. It is placed near the top center position of the rectan-             gular\\\\shape outline. The general qualifying symbols for the gates, decoder, and adder were             shown in previous diagrams. The other symbols are self\\\\explanatory and will be used later             in diagrams representing the corresponding digital elements.                 Some of the qualifying symbols associated with inputs and outputs are shown in             Fig. 10.4. Symbols associated with inputs are placed on the left side of the column             labeled symbol. Symbols associated with outputs are placed on the right side of the             column. The active\\\\low input or output symbol is the polarity indicator.

The             dynamic input is associated with the clock input in flip\\\\flop circuits. It indicates that the             input is active on a transition from a low\\\\to\\\\high\\\\level signal. The three\\\\state output has             a third high\\\\impedance state, which has no logic significance. When the circuit is enabled,             the output is in the normal 0 or 1 logic state, but when the circuit is disabled, the three\\\\             state output is in a high\\\\impedance state. This state is equivalent to an open circuit.                 The open\\\\collector output has one state that exhibits a high\\\\impedance condition. An             externally connected resistor is sometimes required in order to produce the proper logic             level. The diamond\\\\shape symbol may have a bar on top (for high type) or on the bottom             (for low type). The high or low type specifies the logic level when the output is not in             the high\\\\impedance state. For example, TTL\\\\type integrated circuits have special outputs             called open\\\\collector outputs. These outputs are recognized by a diamond\\\\shape symbol             with a bar under it. This indicates that the output can be either in a high\\\\impedance state             or in a low\\\\level state. When used as part of a distribution function, two or more open\\\\             collector NAND gates when connected to a common resistor perform a positive\\\\logic             AND function or a negative\\\\logic OR function.                 The output with special amplification is used in gates that provide special driving             capabilities. Such gates are employed in components such as clock drivers or bus\\\\oriented             transmitters. The EN symbol designates an enable input. It has the effect of enabling all             outputs when it is active. When the input marked with EN is inactive, all outputs are             disabled. The symbols for flip\\\\flop inputs have the usual meaning. The D input is also             associated with other storage elements such as memory input.                 The symbols for shift right and shift left are arrows pointing to the right or the left,             respectively. The symbols for count\\\\up and count\\\\down counters are the plus and minus             symbols, respectively. An output designated by CT = 15 will be active when the contents             of the register reach the binary count of 15. When nonstandard information is shown             inside the outline, it is enclosed in square brackets [like this]. 10.3 DEPENDENCY NOTATION             The most important aspect of the standard logic symbols is the dependency notation.             Dependency notation is used to provide the means of denoting the relationship between             different inputs or outputs without actually showing all the elements and interconnections             between them. We will first demonstrate the dependency notation with an example of the             AND dependency and then define all the other symbols associated with this notation.                 The AND dependency is represented with the letter G followed by a number. Any             input or output in a diagram that is labeled with the number associated with G is consid-             ered to be ANDed with it. For example, if one input in the diagram has the label G1 and             another input is labeled with the number 1, then the two inputs labeled G1 and 1 are             considered to be ANDed together internally.                 An example of AND dependency is shown in Fig. 10.5. In (a), we have a portion of             a graphic symbol with two AND dependency labels, G1 and G2. There are two inputs             labeled with the number 1 and one input labeled with the number 2. The equivalent                                X                                Y                                                                        & X  G1                          A Y  G2                                                          & A  1 B  1                           B C  2                                                          &    (a) Block with G1 and G2                                                       C                                                          (b) Equivalent interpretation FIGURE 10.5 Example of G (AND) dependency interpretation is shown in part (b) of the figure. Input X associated with G1 is considered to be ANDed with inputs A and B, which are labeled with a 1. Similarly, input Y is ANDed with input C to conform with the dependency between G2 and 2.    The standard defines 10 other dependencies. Each dependency is denoted by a letter symbol (except EN). The letter appears at the input or output and is followed by a number. Each input or output affected by that dependency is labeled with that same number. The 11 dependencies and their corresponding letter designation are as follows:    G Denotes an AND (gate) relationship    V Denotes an OR relationship    N Denotes a negate (exclusive-OR) relationship    EN Specifies an enable action    C Identifies a control dependency    S Specifies a setting action    R Specifies a resetting action    M Identifies a mode dependency    A Identifies an address dependency                                   Section 10.4 Symbols for Combinational Elements 495          Z Indicates an internal interconnection          X Indicates a controlled transmission          The V and N dependencies are used to denote the Boolean relationships of OR and       exclusive\\\\OR similar to the G that denotes the Boolean AND. The EN dependency is       similar to the qualifying symbol EN except that a number follows it (for example, EN 2).       Only the outputs marked with that number are disabled when the input associated with       EN is active.          The control dependency C is used to identify a clock input in a sequential element       and to indicate which input is controlled by it. The set S and reset R dependencies are       used to specify internal logic states of an SR flip\\\\flop. The C, S, and R dependencies       are explained in Section 10.5 in conjunction with the flip\\\\flop circuit. The mode M       dependency is used to identify inputs that select the mode of operation of the unit. The       mode dependency is presented in Section 10.6 in conjunction with registers and coun-       ters. The address A dependency is used to identify the address input of a memory. It is       introduced in Section 10.8 in conjunction with the memory unit.          The Z dependency is used to indicate interconnections inside the unit. It signifies the       existence of internal logic connections between inputs, outputs, internal inputs, and inter-       nal outputs, in any combination. The X dependency is used to indicate the controlled       transmission path in a CMOS transmission gate. 10.4  SYMBOLS FOR COMBINATIONAL ELEMENTS       The examples in this section and the rest of this chapter illustrate the use of the standard       in representing various digital components with graphic symbols. The examples demon-       strate actual commercial integrated circuits with the pin numbers included in the inputs       and outputs. Most of the ICs presented in this chapter are included with the suggested       experiments outlined in Chapter 9.          The graphic symbols for the adder and decoder were shown in Section 10.2. IC type       74155 can be connected as a 3 * 8 decoder, as shown in Fig. 10.6. (The truth table of this       decoder is shown in Fig. 9.7.) There are two C and two G inputs in the IC. Each pair must       be connected together as shown in the diagram. The enable input is active when in the       low\\\\level state. The outputs are all active low. The inputs are assigned binary weights 1, 2,       and 4, equivalent to 20, 21, and 22, respectively. The outputs are assigned numbers from 0       to 7. The sum of the weights of the inputs determines the output that is active. Thus, if the       two input lines with weights 1 and 4 are activated, the total weight is 1 + 4 = 5 and output       5 is activated. Of course, the EN input must be activated for any output to be active.          The decoder is a special case of a more general component referred to as a coder.       A coder is a device that receives an input binary code on a number of inputs and produces       a different binary code on a number of outputs. Instead of using the qualifying symbol       X/Y, the coder can be specified by the code name. For example, the 3\\\\to\\\\8\\\\line decoder       of Fig. 10.6 can be symbolized with the name BIN/OCT since the circuit converts a 3\\\\bit       binary number into 8 octal values, 0 through 7.

The AND dependency is sometimes represented by                                  0 a  shorthand  notation  like  G  7  .  This  symbol  stands     for  eight AND     dependency    symbols from 0 to 7 as follows:                               G0, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6, G7 At any given time, only one out of the eight AND gates can be active. The active AND gate is determined from the inputs associated with the G symbol. These inputs are marked with weights equal to the powers of 2. For the eight AND gates just listed, the weights are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the numbers 20, 21, and 22, respectively. The AND gate that is active at any given time is determined from the sum of the weights of the active inputs. Thus, if inputs 0 and 2 are active, then the AND gate that is active has the number 20 + 22 = 5. This makes G5 active and the other seven AND gates inactive.    The standard graphic symbol for a 8 * 1 multiplexer is shown in Fig. 10.7(a). The qualifying symbol MUX identifies the device as a multiplexer. The symbols inside the block are part of the standard notation, but the symbols marked outside are user\\\\ defined symbols. The function table of the 741551 IC can be found in Fig. 9.9. The AND                                        0 dependency    is  marked   with  G     7  and   is  associated  with  the  inputs  enclosed  in  brackets. These inputs have weights of 0, 1, and 2. They are actually what we have called the selection inputs. The eight data inputs are marked with numbers from 0 to 7. The net weight of the active inputs associated with the G symbol specifies the number in the data input that is active. For example, if selection inputs CBA = 110, then inputs 1 and 2 associated with G are active. This gives a numerical value for the AND dependency of 22 + 21 = 6, which makes G 6 active. Since G 6 is ANDed with data input number 6, it makes this input active. Thus, the output will be equal to data input D6 provided that the enable input is active.

The enable and selection inputs are common to all four             multiplexers. This is indicated in the standard notation by the indented box at the top             of the diagram, which represents a common control block. The inputs to a common             control block control all lower sections of the diagram. The common enable input EN             is active when in the low\\\\level state. The AND dependency, G1, determines which input             is active in each multiplexer section.When G1 = 0, the A inputs marked with 1 are active.             When G1 = 1, the B inputs marked with 1 are active. The active inputs are applied to             the corresponding outputs if EN is active. Note that the input symbols 1 and 1 are             marked in the upper section only instead of repeating them in each section. 10.5 SYMBOLS FOR FLIP\\\\FLOPS             The standard graphic symbols for different types of flip\\\\flops are shown in Fig. 10.8.             A flip\\\\flop is represented by a rectangular\\\\shaped block with inputs on the left and             outputs on the right. One output designates the normal state of the flip\\\\flop and the 1D                                               1D C1                                               C1 D latch                                          Positive-edge-triggered                                                          D flip-flop         1J                                                1J           C1                                                C1                                                           1K         1K                                                  Negative-edge-triggered Positive-edge-triggered                                  JK flip-flop        JK flip-flop                                 1J                       1D                                                          C1                                 C1                                 1K               Master-slave D flip-flop                       Master-slave JK flip-flop FIGURE 10.8 Standard graphic symbols for flip\\\\flops other output with a small\\\\circle negation symbol (or polarity indicator) designates the complement output. The graphic symbols distinguish between three types of flip\\\\flops: the D latch, whose internal construction is shown in Fig. 6.5; the masterCslave flip\\\\flop, shown in Fig. 6.9; and the edge\\\\triggered flip\\\\flop, introduced in Fig. 6.12. The graphic symbol for the D latch or D flip\\\\flop has inputs D and C indicated inside the block. The graphic symbol for the JK flip\\\\flop has inputs J, K, and C inside. The notation C1, 1D, 1J, and 1K are examples of control dependency. The input in C1 controls input 1D in a D flip\\\\flop and inputs 1J and 1K in a JK flip\\\\flop.    The D latch has no other symbols besides the 1D and C1 inputs. The edge\\\\triggered flip\\\\flop has an arrowhead\\\\shaped symbol in front of the control dependency C1 to designate a dynamic input. The dynamic indicator symbol denotes that the flip\\\\flop responds to the positive\\\\edge transition of the input clock pulses. A small circle outside the block along the dynamic indicator designates a negative\\\\edge transition for trigger- ing the flip\\\\flop. The masterCslave is considered to be a pulse\\\\triggered flip\\\\flop and is                                               Section 10.6 Symbols for Registers 499 2                                             4          S                                             S 4   1J       15                                               3               5 1                                                         C1          C1                                               2 1D 6 16           14     1K                                               1 3                                                      R          R               (a) One-half 7476 JK flip-flop  (b) One-half 7474 D flip-flop FIGURE 10.9 IC flip\\\\flops with direct set and reset             indicated as such with an upside\\\\down L symbol in front of the outputs. This is to show             that the output signal changes on the falling edge of the pulse. Note that the masterC             slave flip\\\\flop is drawn without the dynamic indicator.                 Flip\\\\flops available in integrated\\\\circuit packages provide special inputs for setting             and resetting the flip\\\\flop asynchronously. These inputs are usually called direct set and             direct reset. They affect the output on the negative level of the signal without the need             of a clock. The graphic symbol of a masterCslave JK flip\\\\flop with direct set and reset is             shown in Fig. 10.9(a). The notations C1, 1J, and 1K represent control dependency, show-             ing that the clock input at C1 controls inputs 1J and 1K. S and R have no 1 in front of             the letters and, therefore, they are not controlled by the clock at C1. The S and R inputs             have a small circle along the input lines to indicate that they are active when in the             logic\\\\0 level. The function table for the 7476 flip\\\\flop is shown in Fig. 9.12.                 The graphic symbol for a positive\\\\edge\\\\triggered D flip\\\\flop with direct set and reset             is shown in Fig. 10.9(b). The positive\\\\edge transition of the clock at input C1 controls             input 1D. The S and R inputs are independent of the clock. This is IC type 7474, whose             function table is listed in Fig. 9.13. 10.6 SYMBOLS FOR REGISTERS             The standard graphic symbol for a register is equivalent to the symbol used for a group             of flip\\\\flops with a common clock input. Fig. 10.10 shows the standard graphic symbol             of IC type 74175, consisting of four D flip\\\\flops with common clock and clear inputs.             The clock input C1 and the clear input R appear in the common control block. The             inputs to the common control block are connected to each of the elements in the lower             sections of the diagram. The notation C1 is the control dependency that controls all the             1D inputs. Thus, each flip\\\\flop is triggered by the common clock input. The dynamic             input symbol associated with C1 indicates that the flip\\\\flops are triggered on the positive             edge of the input clock. The common R input resets all flip\\\\flops when its input is at a             low\\\\level state. The 1D symbol is placed only once in the upper section instead of Clear  1 Clock          R        9                   C1                                             4 1D   2                                             5               Q                                            12      3 Q                                            13      7 FIGURE 10.10                                       6 Graphic symbol for IC type 74175 quad flip-flop                                                   10                                                   11                                                   15                                                   14 repeating it in each section. The complement outputs of the flip\\\\flops in this diagram are marked with the polarity symbol rather than the negation symbol.    The standard graphic symbol for a shift register with parallel load is shown in Fig. 10.11. This is IC type 74195, whose function table can be found in Fig. 9.16. The qualifying symbol for a shift register is SRG followed by a number that designates the number of stages. Thus, SRG4 denotes a four\\\\bit shift register. The common control block has two mode dependencies, M1 and M2, for the shift and load operations, respec- tively. Note that the IC has a single input labeled SH/LD (shift/load), which is split into two lines to show the two modes. M1 is active when the SH/LD input is high and M2 is active when the SH/LD input is low. M2 is recognized as active low from the polarity indicator along its input line. Note the convention in this symbology: We must recognize that a single input actually exists in pin 9, but it is split into two parts in order to assign to it the two modes, M1 and M2. The control dependency C3 is for the clock input. The dynamic symbol along the C3 input indicates that the flip\\\\flops trigger on the positive edge of the clock. The symbol /1 S following C3 indicates that the register shifts to the right or in the downward direction when mode M1 is active.    The four sections below the common control block represent the four flip\\\\flops. Flip\\\\ flop QA has three inputs: Two are associated with the serial (shift) operation and one                  1     Section 10.6 Symbols for Registers 501 Clear                               SRG4                  9  R SH/LD               M1 [SHIFT]                     M2 [LOAD]                10 Clock                 C3/1           2         1, 3J  15 J                   1, 3K            QA                     2, 3D           3         2, 3D  14 K                                    QB           4                13 A                                    QC           5                12 B                                    QD           6                11 C                                    QD           7 D     FIGURE 10.11     Graphic symbol for a shift register with parallel load, IC type 74195 with the parallel (load) operation. The serial input label 1, 3J indicates that the J input of flip\\\\flop QA is active when M1 (shift) is active and C3 goes through a positive clock transition. The other serial input with label 1, 3K has a polarity symbol in its input line corresponding to the complement of input K in a JK flip\\\\flop. The third input of QA and the inputs of the other flip\\\\flops are for the parallel input data. Each input is denoted by the label 2, 3D. The 2 is for M2 (load), and 3 is for the clock C3. If the input in pin number 9 is in the low level, M1 is active, and a positive transition of the clock at C3 causes a parallel transfer from the four inputs, A through D, into the four flip\\\\flops, QA through QD. Note that the parallel input is labeled only in the first and second sections. It is assumed to be in the other two sections below.    Figure 10.12 shows the graphic symbol for the bidirectional shift register with paral- lel load, IC type 74194. The function table for this IC is listed in Fig. 9.19. The common control block shows an R input for resetting all flip\\\\flops to 0 asynchronously. The mode select has two inputs and the mode dependency M may take binary values from 0 to 3. This is indicated by the symbol M 03, which stands for M0, M1, M2, M3, and is similar to the notation for the G dependency in multiplexers. The symbol associated with the clock is                                               C4>1 S >2 d C4 is the control dependency for the clock. The /1 S symbol indicates that the register shifts right (down in this case) when the mode is M1 (S1 S0 = 10).

The right and left directions are obtained when the page is turned 90 degrees counter-             clockwise.                 The sections below the common control block represent the four flip\\\\flops. The first             flip\\\\flop has a serial input for shift right, denoted by 1, 4D (mode M1, clock C4,             input D). The last flip\\\\flop has a serial input for shift left, denoted by 2, 4D (mode M2,             clock C4, input D). All four flip\\\\flops have a parallel input denoted by the label 3, 4D             (mode M3, clock C4, input D). Thus, M3 (S1 S0 = 11) is for parallel load. The remaining             mode M0 (S1 S0 = 00) has no effect on the outputs because it is not included in the             input labels. 10.7 SYMBOLS FOR COUNTERS             The standard graphic symbol of a binary ripple counter is shown in Fig. 10.13. The             qualifying symbol for a ripple counter is RCTR. The designation DIV2 stands for the             divide\\\\by\\\\2 circuit that is obtained from the single flip\\\\flop QA. The DIV8 designation             is for the divide\\\\by\\\\8 counter obtained from the other three flip\\\\flops. The diagram             represents IC type 7493, whose internal circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 9.2. The com-             mon control block has an internal AND gate, with inputs R1 and R2. When both of             these inputs are equal to 1, the content of the counter goes to zero. This is indicated by             2     Section 10.7 Symbols for Counters 503 R1                       RCTR             3  & CT  0 R2          14     DIV2                12 A                                             QA            1           DIV8      0  9   QB B                                            CT     8   QC                                  2  11  QD     FIGURE 10.13     Graphic symbol for ripple counter, IC type 7493 the symbol CT = 0. Since the count input does not go to the clock inputs of all flip\\\\flops, it has no C1 label and, instead, the symbol + is used to indicate a count\\\\up operation. The dynamic symbol next to the + together with the polarity symbol along the input line signify that the count is affected with a negative\\\\edge transition of the input signal. The bit grouping from 0 to 2 in the output represents values for the weights to the power of 2. Thus, 0 represents the value of 20 = 1 and 2 represents the value 22 = 4.    The standard graphic symbol for the four\\\\bit counter with parallel load, IC type 74161, is shown in Fig. 10.14. The qualifying symbol for a synchronous counter is CTR followed by the symbol DIV16 (divide by 16), which gives the cycle length of the counter. There is a single load input at pin 9 that is split into the two modes, M1 and M2. M1 is active when the load input at pin 9 is low and M2 is active when the load input at pin 9 is high. M1 is recognized as active low from the polarity indicator along its input line.The count\\\\ enable inputs use the G dependencies. G3 is associated with the T input and G4 with the P input of the count enable. The label associated with the clock is                                                C5>2, 3, 4 + This means that the circuit counts up (the + symbol) when M2, G3, and G4 are active (load = 1, ENT = 1, and ENP = 1) and the clock in C5 goes through a positive transition. This condition is specified in the function table of the 74161 listed in Fig. 9.15. The paral- lel inputs have the label 1, 5D, meaning that the D inputs are active when M1 is active (load = 0) and the clock goes through a positive transition. The output carry is designated by the label                                                  3CT = 15 This is interpreted to mean that the output carry is active (equal to 1) if G3 is active (ENT = 1) and the content (CT) of the counter is 15 (binary 1111).

The polarity symbol in the C5 input designates an inverted pulse for the input clock.             This means that the master is triggered on the negative transition of the clock pulse and             the slave changes state on the positive transition. Thus, the output changes on the posi-             tive transition of the clock pulse. It should be noted that IC type 74LS161 (low\\\\power             Schottky version) has positive\\\\edge\\\\triggered flip\\\\flops. 10.8 SYMBOL FOR RAM             The standard graphic symbol for the random\\\\access memory (RAM) 74189 is shown             in Fig. 10.15. The numbers 16 * 4 that follow the qualifying symbol RAM designate             the number of words and the number of bits per word. The common control block is             shown with four address lines and two control inputs. Each bit of the word is shown in             a separate section with an input and output data line. The address dependency A is             used to identify the address inputs of the memory. Data inputs and outputs affected             by the address are labeled with the letter A. The bit grouping from 0 through 3 provides             the binary address that ranges from A0 through A15. The inverted triangle signifies             three\\\\state outputs. The polarity symbol specifies the inversion of the outputs.                 The operation of the memory is specified by means of the dependency notation. The             RAM graphic symbol uses four dependencies: A (address), G (AND), EN (enable), and             C (control). Input G1 is to be considered ANDed with 1EN and 1C2 because G1 has a             1 after the letter G and the other two have a 1 in their label. The EN dependency is used                                                                     Problems 505               1 RAM 16  4           A0              0           A1  15           A2  14             A 105           A3  13          2           CS 2 G1           WE  3           1EN [READ]                           1C2 [WRITE]           D1  4           A, 2D                    A   5                                                                 S1                        6           D2                                           7                                                                 S2                      10           D3                                           9                                                                 S3                      12           D4                                          11                                                                 S4 FIGURE 10.15 Graphic symbol for 164 RAM, IC type 74189 to identify an enable input that controls the data outputs. The dependency C2 controls the inputs as indicated by the 2D label. Thus, for a write operation, we have the G1 and 1C2 dependency (CS = 0), the C2 and 2D dependency (WE = 0), and the A dependency, which specifies the binary address in the four address inputs. For a read operation, we have the G1 and 1EN dependencies (CS = 0, WE = 1) and the A dependency for the outputs. The interpretation of these dependencies results in the operation of the memory as listed in the function table of the 74189 RAM (see Web Search Topics).

Dopants are differentiated on the basis of whether they have either three valence elec-             trons or five valence electrons. A silicon crystalline structure is such that each silicon             atom shares its four valence electrons with its four nearest neighbors, thereby completing             its valence structure. The atoms of a dopant with five valence electrons, referred to as a             n\\\\type dopant, fit in the physical structure of the crystal, but their fifth electrons are held             only loosely by their parent atoms in the bonded structure. Consequently, an applied             electric field can cause such electrons to flow as a current. On the other hand, a dopant             atom with only three valence electrons, a p\\\\type dopant, has a vacant valence site. Under             the influence of an applied electric field, an electron from a neighboring silicon atom in             the bonded structure can jump from its host and fill a vacant dopant site, leaving behind             a vacancy at its host. This migration, visualized as a leapfrogging of electrons from hole             to hole, establishes a current.                 Current is due to the movement of electrons, which are negative charge carriers. Cur-             rent is measured, however, in the opposite direction of flow, by conventionsince the             days of Benjamin Franklin. (Think of current as being the motion of an equivalent             positive charge moving in the opposite direction of an electron, whose charge is nega-             tive). Holes move in the direction of current, although the underlying physical movement             of electrons is in the opposite direction. Thermal agitation causes both types of charge             carriers to be present in a semiconductor. If the majority carrier is a hole, the device is             said to be a p\\\\type device; if the majority carrier is an electron, the device is said to be             an n\\\\type device. Bipolar transistors rely on both types of carriers. Metal\\\\oxide silicon             semiconductors rely on a majority carrier, either an electron or a hole, but not both. The             type and relative amount of dopant determine the type of a semiconductor material.                                                                                                                         507 508 Appendix Semiconductors and CMOS Integrated Circuits gate ()                                      gate () drain ()  source                             drain ()     source p  p                                         n  n                            n-type substrate  p-type substrate                                               (b) n-channel                              (a) p-channel FIGURE A.1 Basic structure of MOS transistor    The basic structure of a metal\\\\oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor is shown in Fig. A.1. The p\\\\channel MOS transistor consists of a lightly doped substrate of n\\\\type silicon material. Two regions are heavily doped with p\\\\type impurities by a diffusion pro- cess to form the source and drain. The source terminal supplies charge carriers to an external circuit; the drain terminal removes charge carriers from the circuit. The region between the two p\\\\type sections serves as the channel. In its simplest form, the gate is a metal plate separated from the channel by an insulted dielectric of silicon dioxide. A negative voltage (with respect to the substrate) at the gate terminal causes an induced electric field in the channel that attracts p\\\\type carriers (holes) from the substrate. As the magnitude of the negative voltage increases, the region below the gate accumulates more positive carriers, the conductivity increases, and current can flow from source to drain, provided that a voltage difference is maintained between these two terminals.    There are four basic types of MOS structures. The channel can be p or n type, depend- ing on whether the majority carriers are holes or electrons. The mode of operation can be enhancement or depletion, depending on the state of the channel region at zero gate voltage. If the channel is initially doped lightly with p\\\\type impurity (in which case it is called a diffused channel), a conducting channel exists at zero gate voltage and the device is said to operate in the depletion mode. In this mode, current flows unless the channel is depleted by an applied gate field. If the region beneath the gate is left initially uncharged, a channel must be induced by the gate field before current can flow. Thus, the channel current is enhanced by the gate voltage, and such a device is said to operate in the enhancement mode.    The source is the terminal through which the majority carriers enter the device. If the majority carrier is a hole (p\\\\type channel), the source terminal supplies current to the circuit; if the majority carrier is an electron (n\\\\type channel), the source removes current from the circuit. The drain is the terminal through which the majority carriers leave the device. In a p\\\\channel MOS, the source terminal is connected to the substrate and a negative voltage is applied to the drain terminal. When the gate voltage is above a threshold voltage VT (about - 2 V ), no current flows in the channel and the drain\\\\to\\\\ source path is like an open circuit. When the gate voltage is sufficiently negative below VT, a channel is formed and p\\\\type carriers flow from source to drain. p\\\\type carriers are positive and correspond to a positive current flow from source to drain.

When the gate voltage is below the threshold voltage VT (about 2 V), no current flows in the channel. When the gate volt- age is sufficiently positive above VT to form the channel, n\\\\type carriers flow from source to drain. n\\\\type carriers are negative and correspond to a positive current flow from drain to source. The threshold voltage may vary from 1 to 4 V, depending on the particular process used.    The graphic symbols for the MOS transistors are shown in Fig. A.2. The symbol for the enhancement type is the one with the broken\\\\line connection between source and drain. In this symbol, the substrate can be identified and is shown connected to the source. An alternative symbol omits the substrate, and instead an arrow is placed in the source terminal to show the direction of positive current flow (from source to drain in the p\\\\channel MOS and from drain to source in the n\\\\channel MOS).    Because of the symmetrical construction of source and drain, the MOS transistor can be operated as a bilateral device. Although normally operated so that carriers flow from source to drain, there are circumstances when it is convenient to allow carriers to flow from drain to source.    One advantage of the MOS device is that it can be used not only as a transistor, but as a resistor as well. A resistor is obtained from the MOS by permanently biasing the gate terminal for conduction. The ratio of the sourceCdrain voltage to the channel current then determines the value of the resistance. Different resistor values may be constructed during manufacturing by fixing the channel length and width of the MOS device.    Three logic circuits using MOS devices are shown in Fig. A.3. For an n\\\\channel MOS, the supply voltage VDD is positive (about 5 V), to allow positive current flow from drain to source. The two voltage levels are a function of the threshold voltage VT. The low level is anywhere from zero to VT, and the high level ranges from VT to VDD. The n\\\\channel gates usually employ positive logic. The p\\\\channel MOS circuits use a negative voltage for VDD, to allow positive current flow from source to drain. The two voltage levels are both negative above and below the negative threshold voltage VT. p\\\\channel gates usu- ally employ negative logic.    The inverter circuit shown in Fig. A.3(a) uses two MOS devices. Q1 acts as the load resistor and Q2 as the active device. The load\\\\resistor MOS has its gate connected to VDD, 510 Appendix Semiconductors and CMOS Integrated Circuits                                                             VDD      VDD                                          VDD                                                   B      Q1                  A          Y  (AB)                                                A                                                                  Y  (A  B)                    Y  A A    Q2                  B      (a) Inverter           (b) NAND gate         (c) NOR gate      FIGURE A.3      n\\\\channel MOS logic circuits      thus maintaining it in the conduction state.When the input voltage is low (below VT), Q2      turns off. Since Q1 is always on, the output voltage is about VDD. When the input voltage      is high (aboveVT), Q2 turns on. Current flows from VDD through the load resistor Q1 and      into Q2. The geometry of the two MOS devices must be such that the resistance of Q2,      when conducting, is much less than the resistance of Q1 to maintain the output Y at a      voltage below VT.         The NAND gate shown in Fig. A.3(b) uses transistors in series. Inputs A and B must      both be high for all transistors to conduct and cause the output to go low. If either input      is low, the corresponding transistor is turned off and the output is high. Again, the series      resistance formed by the two active MOS devices must be much less than the resistance      of the load\\\\resistor MOS.The NOR gate shown in Fig.A.3(c) uses transistors in parallel.      If either input is high, the corresponding transistor conducts and the output is low. If all      inputs are low, all active transistors are off and the output is high. A.1  COMPLEMENTARY MOS      Complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits take advantage of the fact that both n\\\\channel      and p\\\\channel devices can be fabricated on the same substrate. CMOS circuits consist      of both types of MOS devices, interconnected to form logic functions. The basic cir-      cuit is the inverter, which consists of one p\\\\channel transistor and one n\\\\channel      transistor, as shown in Fig. A.4(a). The source terminal of the p\\\\channel device is at      VDD, and the source terminal of the n\\\\channel device is at ground.

The two voltage levels are 0 V for the low level             and VDD for the high level (typically, 5 V).                 To understand the operation of the inverter, we must review the behavior of the MOS             transistor from the previous section:                 1. The n\\\\channel MOS conducts when its gate\\\\to\\\\source voltage is positive.                 2. The p\\\\channel MOS conducts when its gate\\\\to\\\\source voltage is negative.                 3. Either type of device is turned off if its gate\\\\to\\\\source voltage is zero.                 Now consider the operation of the inverter. When the input is low, both gates are at             zero potential. The input is at -VDD relative to the source of the p\\\\channel device and             at 0 V relative to the source of the n\\\\channel device. The result is that the p\\\\channel             device is turned on and the n\\\\channel device is turned off. Under these conditions, there             is a low\\\\impedance path from VDD to the output and a very high impedance path from             output to ground. Therefore, the output voltage approaches the high level VDD under             normal loading conditions. When the input is high, both gates are at VDD and the situa-             tion is reversed: The p\\\\channel device is off and the n\\\\channel device is on. The result is             that the output approaches the low level of 0 V.                 Two other CMOS basic gates are shown in Fig.A.4.A two\\\\input NAND gate consists             of two p\\\\type units in parallel and two n\\\\type units in series, as shown in Fig. A.4(b). If             all inputs are high, both p\\\\channel transistors turn off and both n\\\\channel transistors             turn on. The output has a low impedance to ground and produces a low state. If any input             is low, the associated n\\\\channel transistor is turned off and the associated p\\\\channel             transistor is turned on. The output is coupled to VDD and goes to the high state. Multiple\\\\             input NAND gates may be formed by placing equal numbers of p\\\\type and n\\\\type             transistors in parallel and series, respectively, in an arrangement similar to that shown             in Fig. A.4(b).                 A two\\\\input NOR gate consists of two n\\\\type units in parallel and two p\\\\type units in             series, as shown in Fig. A.4(c). When all inputs are low, both p\\\\channel units are on and             both n\\\\channel units are off.The output is coupled to VDD and goes to the high state. If any             input is high, the associated p\\\\channel transistor is turned off and the associated n\\\\channel             transistor turns on, connecting the output to ground and causing a low\\\\level output.                 MOS transistors can be considered to be electronic switches that either conduct             or are open. As an example, the CMOS inverter can be visualized as consisting of two             switches as shown in Fig. A.5(a). Applying a low voltage to the input causes the upper             switch (p) to close, supplying a high voltage to the output. Applying a high voltage             to the input causes the lower switch (n) to close, connecting the output to ground.             Thus, the output Vout is the complement of the input Vin. Commercial applications             often use other graphic symbols for MOS transistors to emphasize the logical behav-             ior of the switches. The arrows showing the direction of current flow are omitted.             Instead, the gate input of the p\\\\channel transistor is drawn with an inversion bubble             on the gate terminal to show that it is enabled with a low voltage. The inverter circuit             is redrawn with these symbols in Fig. A.5(b). A logic 0 in the input causes the upper             transistor to conduct, making the output logic 1. A logic 1 in the input enables the             lower transistor, making the output logic 0.

This is             because at least one transistor is always off in the path between the power supply and             ground when the state of the circuit is not changing. As a result, a typical CMOS gate             has static power dissipation on the order of 0.01 mW. However, when the circuit is             changing state at the rate of 1 MHz, the power dissipation increases to about 1 mW, and             at 10 MHz it is about 5 mW.                 CMOS logic is usually specified for a single power\\\\supply operation over a voltage             range from 3 to 18 V with a typical VDD value of 5 V. Operating CMOS at a larger power\\\\             supply voltage reduces the propagation delay time and improves the noise margin, but             the power dissipation is increased. The propagation delay time with VDD = 5 V ranges             from 5 to 20 ns, depending on the type of CMOS used. The noise margin is usually about             40% of the power supply voltage. The fan\\\\out of CMOS gates is about 30 when they are             operated at a frequency of 1 MHz. The fan\\\\out decreases with an increase in the             frequency of operation of the gates.                 There are several series of the CMOS digital logic family. The 74C series are pin and             function compatible with TTL devices having the same number. For example, CMOS             IC type 74C04 has six inverters with the same pin configuration as TTL type 7404. The             high\\\\speed CMOS 74HC series is an improvement over the 74C series, with a tenfold             increase in switching speed. The 74HCT series is electrically compatible with TTL ICs.             This means that circuits in this series can be connected to inputs and outputs of TTL ICs             without the need of additional interfacing circuits. Newer versions of CMOS are the             high\\\\speed series 74VHC and its TTL\\\\compatible version 74VHCT.                 The CMOS fabrication process is simpler than that of TTL and provides a greater             packing density. Thus, more circuits can be placed on a given area of silicon at a reduced             cost per function. This property, together with the low power dissipation of CMOS cir-             cuits, good noise immunity, and reasonable propagation delay, makes CMOS the most             popular standard as a digital logic family. 514  Appendix Semiconductors and CMOS Integrated Circuits A.2  CMOS TRANSMISSION GATE CIRCUITS       A special CMOS circuit that is not available in the other digital logic families is the       transmission gate. The transmission gate is essentially an electronic switch that is con-       trolled by an input logic level. It is used to simplify the construction of various digital       components when fabricated with CMOS technology.           Figure A.6(a) shows the basic circuit of the transmission gate. Whereas a CMOS       inverter consists of a p\\\\channel transistor connected in series with an n\\\\channel transis-       tor, a transmission gate is formed by one n\\\\channel and one p\\\\channel MOS transistor       connected in parallel.           The n\\\\channel substrate is connected to ground and the p\\\\channel substrate is con-       nected to VDD. When the N gate is at VDD and the P gate is at ground, both transistors       conduct and there is a closed path between input X and output Y. When the N gate is       at ground and the P gate is at VDD, both transistors are off and there is an open circuit       between X and Y. Figure A.4(b) shows the block diagram of the transmission gate. Note       that the terminal of the p\\\\channel gate is marked with the negation symbol. Figure A.4(c)       demonstrates the behavior of the switch in terms of positive\\\\logic assignment with VDD       equivalent to logic 1 and ground equivalent to logic 0.           The transmission gate is usually connected to an inverter, as shown in Fig. A.7. This       type of arrangement is referred to as a bilateral switch. The control input C is connected       directly to the n\\\\channel gate and its inverse to the p\\\\channel gate. When C = 1, the            N                                                N      X                           Y          X               TG      Y         VDD            P                                                P            (a)                                              (b)                 Closed switch                  Open switch         X                        Y       X                       Y                              N1                N0                              P0                P1                                     (c)      FIGURE A.6      Transmission gate (TG)            Section A.2 CMOS Transmission Gate Circuits 515    C         X                                             TG  Y     FIGURE A.7     Bilateral switch switch is closed, producing a path between X and Y. When C = 0, the switch is open, disconnecting the path between X and Y.    Various circuits can be constructed that use the transmission gate. To demonstrate its usefulness as a component in the CMOS family, we will show three examples.    The exclusive\\\\OR gate can be constructed with two transmission gates and two inverters, as shown in Fig. A.8. Input A controls the paths in the transmission gates and input B is connected to output Y through the gates. When input A is equal to 0, transmis- sion gate TG1 is closed and output Y is equal to input B. When input A is equal to 1, TG2 is closed and output Y is equal to the complement of input B. This results in the exclusive\\\\OR truth table, as indicated in Fig. A.8.    Another circuit that can be constructed with transmission gates is the multiplexer. A four\\\\to\\\\one\\\\line multiplexer implemented with transmission gates is shown in Fig. A.9.

With an opposite polarity in the control inputs, the path disconnects and the circuit behaves like an open switch.The two selection inputs, S1and S0, control the transmission path in the TG circuits. Inside each box is marked the condition for the transmission gate switch to be closed. Thus, if S0 = 0 and S1 = 0, there is a closed path from input I0 to output Y through the two TGs marked with S0 = 0 and S1 = 0. The other three inputs are disconnected from the output by one of the other TG circuits.

The C input controls two      transmission gates TG. When C = 1, the TG connected to input D has a closed path      and the one connected to output Q has an open path. This configuration produces an      equivalent circuit from input D through two inverters to output Q. Thus, the output fol-      lows the data input as long as C remains active. When C switches to 0, the first TG dis-      connects input D from the circuit and the second TG produces a closed path between      the two inverters at the output. Thus, the value that was present at input D at the time      that C went from 1 to 0 is retained at the Q output.         A masterCslave D flip\\\\flop can be constructed with two circuits of the type shown in      Fig. A.10. The first circuit is the master and the second is the slave. Thus, a masterCslave      D flip\\\\flop can be constructed with four transmission gates and six inverters. A.3  SWITCH\\\\LEVEL MODELING WITH HDL      CMOS is the dominant digital logic family used with integrated circuits. By definition,      CMOS is a complementary connection of an NMOS and a PMOS transistor. MOS      transistors can be considered to be electronic switches that either conduct or are open.      By specifying the connections among MOS switches, the designer can describe a digital      circuit constructed with CMOS. This type of description is called switch\\\\level modeling      in Verilog HDL.          The two types of MOS switches are specified in Verilog HDL with the keywords nmos      and pmos. They are instantiated by specifying the three terminals of the transistor, as      shown in Fig. A.2:                                            nmos (drain, source, gate);                                            pmos (drain, source, gate);      Switches are considered to be primitives, so the use of an instance name is optional. 518 Appendix Semiconductors and CMOS Integrated Circuits    The connections to a power source (VDD) and to ground must be specified when MOS circuits are designed. Power and ground are defined with the keywords supply1 and supply0. They are specified, for example, with the following statements:                                               supply1 PWR;                                               supply0 GRD; Sources of type supply1 are equivalent to VDD and have a value of logic 1. Sources of type supply0 are equivalent to ground connection and have a value of logic 0.    The description of the CMOS inverter of Fig. A.4(a) is shown in HDL Example A.1. The input, the output, and the two supply sources are declared first. The module instan- tiates a PMOS and an NMOS transistor. The output Y is common to both transistors at their drain terminals. The input is also common to both transistors at their gate terminals. The source terminal of the PMOS transistor is connected to PWR and the source terminal of the NMOS transistor is connected to GRD. HDL Example A.1 // CMOS inverter of Fig. A.4(a)  // (Drain, source, gate) module inverter (Y, A);          // (Drain, source, gate)  input A;  output Y;  supply1 PWR;  supply0 GRD;  pmos (Y, PWR, A);  nmos (Y, GRD, A); endmodule    The second module, set forth in HDL Example A.2, describes the two\\\\input CMOS NAND circuit of Fig. A.4(b). There are two PMOS transistors connected in parallel, with their source terminals connected to PWR. There are also two NMOS transistors connected in series and with a common terminal W1. The drain of the first NMOS is connected to the output, and the source of the second NMOS is connected to GRD. HDL Example A.2 // CMOS two-input NAND of Fig. A.4(b) module NAND2 (Y, A, B); input A, B; output Y; supply1 PWR; supply0 GRD; wire W1;                         // terminal between two nmos pmos (Y, PWR, A);                // source connected to Vdd pmos (Y, PWR, B);                // parallel connection                    Section A.3 Switch\\\\Level Modeling With HDL 519  nmos (Y, W1, A);            // serial connection  nmos (W1, GRD, B);          // source connected to ground endmodule Transmission Gate The transmission gate is instantiated in Verilog HDL with the keyword cmos. It has an output, an input, and two control signals, as shown in Fig. A.6. It is referred to as a cmos switch. The relevant code is as follows: cmos (output, input, ncontrol, pcontrol); // general description cmos (Y, X, N, P); // transmission gate of Fig. A.6(b) Normally, ncontrol and pcontrol are the complement of each other. The cmos switch does not need power sources, since VDD and ground are connected to the substrates of the MOS transistors. Transmission gates are useful for building multiplexers and flip\\\\ flops with CMOS circuits.    HDL Example A.3 describes a circuit with cmos switches. The exclusive\\\\OR circuit of Fig. A.8 has two transmission gates and two inverters. The two inverters are instan- tiated within the module describing a CMOS inverter. The two cmos switches are instantiated without an instance name, since they are primitives in the language. A test module is included to test the circuits operation. Applying all possible combinations of the two inputs, the result of the simulator verifies the operation of the exclusive\\\\OR circuit. The output of the simulation is as follows:                    A=0       B=0  Y=0                    A=0       B=1  Y=1                    A=1       B=0  Y=1                    A=1       B=1  Y=0 HDL Example A.3 //CMOS_XOR with CMOS switches, Fig. A.8 module CMOS_XOR (A, B, Y);   //(output, input, ncontrol, pcontrol)  input A, B;  output Y;  wire A_b, B_b;  // instantiate inverter  inverter v1 (A_b, A);  inverter v2 (B_b, B);  // instantiate cmos switch  cmos (Y, B, A_b, A);  cmos (Y, B_b, A, A_b); endmodule 520 Appendix Semiconductors and CMOS Integrated Circuits // CMOS inverter Fig. A.4(a) module inverter (Y, A); input A; output Y; supply1 PWR; supply0 GND; pmos (Y, PWR, A);                                          //(Drain, source, gate) nmos (Y, GND, A);                                          //(Drain, source, gate) endmodule // Stimulus to test CMOS_XOR module test_CMOS_XOR; reg A,B; wire Y; //Instantiate CMOS_XOR CMOS_XOR X1 (A, B, Y); // Apply truth table initial begin A = 1\\'b0; B = 1\\'b0; #5 A = 1\\'b0; B = 1\\'b1; #5 A = 1\\'b1; B = 1\\'b0; #5 A = 1\\'b1; B = 1\\'b1; end // Display results initial $monitor (\"A =%b B= %b Y =%b\", A, B, Y); endmodule WEB SEARCH TOPICS                        Conductor                        Semiconductor                        Insulator                        Electrical properties of materials                        Valence electron                        Diode                        Transistor                        CMOS process                        CMOS logic gate                        CMOS inverter '"

age digital systems are used in communication business transactions traffic control spacecraft guidance medical treatment weather monitoring the internet and many other commercial industrial and scientific enterprises we have digital telephones digital televisions digital versatile discs digital cameras handheld devices and of course digital computers we enjoy music downloaded to our portable media player g  ipod touch and other handheld devices having high resolution displays these devices have graphical user interfaces guis  which enable them to execute commands that appear to the user to be simple but which in fact involve precise execution of sequence of complex internal instructions most if not all of these devices have special purpose digital computer embedded within them the most striking property of the digital computer is its generality it can follow sequence of instructions called program that operates on given data the user can specify and change the program or the data according to the specific need because of this flexibility general purpose digital computers can perform variety of information processing tasks that range over wide spectrum of applications one characteristic of digital systems is their ability to represent and manipulate discrete elements of information any set that is restricted to finite number of elements contains discrete information examples of discrete sets are the  decimal digits the  letters of the alphabet the  playing cards and the  squares of chessboard early digital computers were used for numeric computations in this case the discrete elements were the digits from this application the term digital computer emerged discrete elements of information are represented in digital system by physical quantities  called signals electrical signals such as voltages and currents are the most common electronic devices called transistors predominate in the circuitry that implements these signals the signals in most present day electronic digital systems use just two discrete values and are therefore said to be binary binary digit called bit has two values  and  discrete elements of information are represented with groups of bits called binary codes for example the decimal digits  through  are represented in digital system with code of four bits g  the number  is represented by    how pattern of bits is interpreted as number depends on the code system in which it resides to make this distinction we could write     to indicate that the pattern   is to be interpreted in binary system and     to indicate that the reference system is decimal then       which is not the same as     or one hundred eleven the subscript indicating the base for interpreting pattern of bits will be used only when clarification is needed through various techniques groups of bits can be made to represent discrete symbols not necessarily numbers which are then used to develop the system in digital format thus digital system is system that manipulates discrete elements of information represented internally in binary form in todays technology binary systems are most practical because as we will see they can be implemented with electronic components discrete quantities of information either emerge from the nature of the data being processed or may be quantized from continuous process on the one hand payroll schedule is an inherently discrete process that contains employee names social security numbers weekly salaries income taxes and so on an employees paycheck is processed by means of discrete data values such as letters of the alphabet names  digits salary  and special symbols such as   on the other hand research scientist may observe continuous process but record only specific quantities in tabular form the scientist is thus quantizing continuous data making each number in his or her table discrete quantity in many cases the quantization of process can be performed automatically by an analog to digital converter device that forms digital discrete representation of analog continuous quantity the general purpose digital computer is the best known example of digital system the major parts of computer are memory unit central processing unit and inputc output units the memory unit stores programs as well as input output and intermediate data the central processing unit performs arithmetic and other data processing operations as specified by the program the program and data prepared by user are transferred into memory by means of an input device such as keyboard an output device such as printer receives the results of the computations and the printed results are presented to the user digital computer can accommodate many input and output devices one very useful device is communication unit that provides interaction with other users through the internet digital computer is powerful instrument that can perform not only arithmetic computations but also logical operations in addition it can be programmed to make decisions based on internal and external conditions there are fundamental reasons that commercial products are made with digital circuits like digital computer most digital devices are programmable by changing the program in programmable device the same underlying hardware can be used for many different applications thereby allowing its cost of development to be spread across wider customer base dramatic cost reductions in digital devices have come about section   binary numbers  because of advances in digital integrated circuit technology as the number of transistors that can be put on piece of silicon increases to produce complex functions the cost per unit decreases and digital devices can be bought at an increasingly reduced price equipment built with digital integrated circuits can perform at speed of hundreds of millions of operations per second digital systems can be made to operate with extreme reliability by using error correcting codes an example of this strategy is the digital versatile disk dvd  in which digital information representing video audio and other data is recorded without the loss of single item digital information on dvd is recorded in such way that by examining the code in each digital sample before it is played back any error can be automatically identified and corrected digital system is an interconnection of digital modules to understand the operation of each digital module it is necessary to have basic knowledge of digital circuits and their logical function the first seven chapters of this book present the basic tools of digital design such as logic gate structures combinational and sequential circuits and programmable logic devices chapter  introduces digital design at the register transfer level rtl using modern hardware description language hdl  chapter  concludes the text with laboratory exercises using digital circuits major trend in digital design methodology is the use of hdl to describe and simulate the functionality of digital circuit an hdl resembles programming language and is suitable for describing digital circuits in textual form it is used to simulate digital system to verify its operation before hardware is built it is also used in conjunction with logic synthesis tools to automate the design process because it is important that students become familiar with an hdl based design methodology hdl descriptions of digital circuits are presented throughout the book while these examples help illustrate the features of an hdl they also demonstrate the best practices used by industry to exploit hdls ignorance of these practices will lead to cute but worthless hdl models that may simulate phenomenon but that cannot be synthesized by design tools or to models that waste silicon area or synthesize to hardware that cannot operate correctly as previously stated digital systems manipulate discrete quantities of information that are represented in binary form operands used for calculations may be expressed in the binary number system other discrete elements including the decimal digits and characters of the alphabet are represented in binary codes digital circuits also referred to as logic circuits process data by means of binary logic elements logic gates using binary signals quantities are stored in binary two valued storage elements flip flops  the purpose of this chapter is to introduce the various binary concepts as frame of reference for further study in the succeeding chapters   binary numbers decimal number such as    represents quantity equal to  thousands plus  hundreds plus  tens plus  units the thousands hundreds etc  are powers of  implied by the position of the coefficients symbols in the number to be more exact    is shorthand notation for what should be written as                    however the convention is to write only the numeric coefficients and from their position deduce the necessary powers of  with powers increasing from right to left in general number with decimal point is represented by series of coefficients a a a  a  the coefficients aj are any of the  digits         and the subscript value gives the place value and hence the power of  by which the coefficient must be multiplied thus the preceding decimal number can be expressed as                             with          and    the decimal number system is said to be of base or radix   because it uses  digits and the coefficients are multiplied by powers of   the binary system is different number system the coefficients of the binary number system have only two possible values  and  each coefficient aj is multiplied by power of the radix g  and the results are added to obtain the decimal equivalent of the number the radix point g  the decimal point when  is the radix distinguishes positive powers of  from negative powers of   for example the decimal equivalent of the binary number     is    as shown from the multiplication of the coefficients by powers of                                      there are many different number systems in general number expressed in base system has coefficients multiplied by powers of an  n  an   n                   m  m the coefficients aj range in value from  to  to distinguish between numbers of different bases we enclose the coefficients in parentheses and write subscript equal to the base used except sometimes for decimal numbers where the content makes it obvious that the base is decimal  an example of base  number is                                   the coefficient values for base  can be only       and  the octal number system is base  system that has eight digits             an example of an octal number is    to determine its equivalent decimal value we expand the number in power series with base of                               note that the digits  and  cannot appear in an octal number it is customary to borrow the needed digits for the coefficients from the decimal system when the base of the number is less than   the letters of the alphabet are used to supplement the  decimal digits when the base of the number is greater than   for example in the hexadecimal base   number system the first  digits are borrowed section   binary numbers  from the decimal system the letters b d and are used for the digits           and   respectively an example of hexadecimal number is f                              the hexadecimal system is used commonly by designers to represent long strings of bits in the addresses instructions and data in digital systems for example f is used to represent          as noted before the digits in binary number are called bits when bit is equal to  it does not contribute to the sum during the conversion therefore the conversion from binary to decimal can be obtained by adding only the numbers with powers of two corresponding to the bits that are equal to  for example                    there are four in the binary number the corresponding decimal number is the sum of the four powers of two zero and the first  numbers obtained from  to the power of are listed in table   in computer work   is referred to as kilo    as mega    as giga  and   as tera thus         and            computer capacity is usually given in bytes byte is equal to eight bits and can accommodate e  represent the code of one keyboard character computer hard disk with four gigabytes of storage has capacity of    bytes approximately  billion bytes  terabyte is   gigabytes approximately  trillion bytes arithmetic operations with numbers in base follow the same rules as for decimal numbers when base other than the familiar base  is used one must be careful to use only the allowable digits examples of addition subtraction and multiplication of two binary numbers are as follows augend     minuend     multiplicand    addend      subtrahend     multiplier    sum     difference          partial product    product     table   powers of two n n n                                                                                                         the sum of two binary numbers is calculated by the same rules as in decimal except that the digits of the sum in any significant position can be only  or  any carry obtained in given significant position is used by the pair of digits one significant position higher subtraction is slightly more complicated the rules are still the same as in decimal except that the borrow in given significant position adds  to minuend digit  borrow in the decimal system adds  to minuend digit  multiplication is simple the multiplier digits are always  or  therefore the partial products are equal either to shifted left copy of the multiplicand or to    number base conversions representations of number in different radix are said to be equivalent if they have the same decimal representation for example     and     are equivalentboth have decimal value  the conversion of number in base to decimal is done by expanding the number in power series and adding all the terms as shown previously we now present general procedure for the reverse operation of converting decimal number to number in base if the number includes radix point it is necessary to separate the number into an integer part and fraction part since each part must be converted differently the conversion of decimal integer to number in base is done by dividing the number and all successive quotients by and accumulating the remainders this procedure is best illustrated by example example   convert decimal  to binary first   is divided by  to give an integer quotient of  and remainder of   then the quotient is again divided by  to give new quotient and remainder the process is continued until the integer quotient becomes  the coefficients of the desired binary number are obtained from the remainders as follows integer remainder coefficient quotient                                                       therefore the answer is      a a a         section   number base conversions  the arithmetic process can be manipulated more conveniently as follows integer remainder                    answer conversion from decimal integers to any base system is similar to this example except that division is done by instead of  example   convert decimal   to octal the required base is  first   is divided by  to give an integer quotient of  and remainder of  then  is divided by  to give an integer quotient of  and remainder of  finally  is divided by  to give quotient of  and remainder of  this process can be conveniently manipulated as follows              the conversion of decimal fraction to binary is accomplished by method similar to that used for integers however multiplication is used instead of division and integers instead of remainders are accumulated again the method is best explained by example example   convert      to binary first     is multiplied by  to give an integer and fraction then the new fraction is multiplied by  to give new integer and new fraction the process is continued until the fraction becomes  or until the number of digits has sufficient accuracy the coefficients of the binary number are obtained from the integers as follows integer fraction coefficient                                                            therefore the answer is                    to convert decimal fraction to number expressed in base a similar procedure is used however multiplication is by instead of  and the coefficients found from the integers may range in value from  to  instead of  and  example   convert      to octal                                                       the answer to seven significant figures is obtained from the integer part of the products             the conversion of decimal numbers with both integer and fraction parts is done by converting the integer and the fraction separately and then combining the two answers using the results of examples   and   we obtain               from examples   and   we have                 octal and hexadecimal numbers the conversion from and to binary octal and hexadecimal plays an important role in digital computers because shorter patterns of hex characters are easier to recognize than long patterns of and since    and     each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits and each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary digits the first  numbers in the decimal binary octal and hexadecimal number systems are listed in table   the conversion from binary to octal is easily accomplished by partitioning the binary number into groups of three digits each starting from the binary point and proceeding to the left and to the right the corresponding octal digit is then assigned to each group the following example illustrates the procedure                                     section   octal and hexadecimal numbers  table   numbers with different bases decimal binary octal hexadecimal base   base   base   base                                                                                                  conversion from binary to hexadecimal is similar except that the binary number is divided into groups of four digits                    b    f  the corresponding hexadecimal or octal digit for each group of binary digits is easily remembered from the values listed in table   conversion from octal or hexadecimal to binary is done by reversing the preceding procedure each octal digit is converted to its three digit binary equivalent similarly each hexadecimal digit is converted to its four digit binary equivalent the procedure is illustrated in the following examples                          and                     binary numbers are difficult to work with because they require three or four times as many digits as their decimal equivalents for example the binary number       is equivalent to decimal    however digital computers use binary numbers and it is sometimes necessary for the human operator or user to communicate directly with the machine by means of such numbers one scheme that retains the binary system in the computer but reduces the number of digits the human must consider utilizes the relationship between the binary number system and the octal or hexadecimal system by this method the human thinks in terms of octal or hexadecimal numbers and performs the required conversion by inspection when direct communication with the machine is necessary thus the binary number       has  digits and is expressed in octal as     digits or in hexadecimal as fff  digits  during communication between people about binary numbers in the computer  the octal or hexadecimal representation is more desirable because it can be expressed more compactly with third or quarter of the number of digits required for the equivalent binary number thus most computer manuals use either octal or hexadecimal numbers to specify binary quantities the choice between them is arbitrary although hexadecimal tends to win out since it can represent byte with two digits   complements of numbers complements are used in digital computers to simplify the subtraction operation and for logical manipulation simplifying operations leads to simpler less expensive circuits to implement the operations there are two types of complements for each base system the radix complement and the diminished radix complement the first is referred to as the rs complement and the second as the  complement when the value of the base is substituted in the name the two types are referred to as the complement and complement for binary numbers and the  complement and complement for decimal numbers diminished radix complement given number in base having digits the  complement of i  its diminished radix complement is defined as n  for decimal numbers   and    so the complement of is    in this case   represents number that consists of single  followed by s   is number represented by s for example if   we have       and        it follows that the complement of decimal number is obtained by subtracting each digit from  here are some numerical examples the  complement of    is             the  complement of    is             for binary numbers   and    so the complement of is   again  is represented by binary number that consists of  followed by s   is binary number represented by s for example if   we have        and         thus the complement of binary number is obtained by subtracting each digit from  however when subtracting binary digits from  we can section   complements of numbers  have either     or     which causes the bit to change from  to  or from  to  respectively therefore the complement of binary number is formed by changing to and to the following are some numerical examples the complement of     is     the complement of     is     the  complement of octal or hexadecimal numbers is obtained by subtracting each digit from  or decimal   respectively radix complement the rs complement of an digit number in base is defined as n for  and as  for   comparing with the  complement we note that the rs complement is obtained by adding  to the  complement since n   n     thus the  complement of decimal   is         and is obtained by adding  to the complement value the complement of binary    is           and is obtained by adding  to the complement value since  is number represented by  followed by s  n which is the  complement of can be formed also by leaving all least significant unchanged subtracting the first nonzero least significant digit from   and subtracting all higher significant digits from  thus the  complement of    is    and the  complement of    is    the  complement of the first number is obtained by subtracting  from  in the least significant position and subtracting all other digits from  the  complement of the second number is obtained by leaving the two least significant unchanged subtracting  from   and subtracting the other three digits from  similarly the complement can be formed by leaving all least significant and the first  unchanged and replacing with and with in all other higher significant digits for example the complement of     is     and the complement of     is     the complement of the first number is obtained by leaving the two least significant and the first  unchanged and then replacing with and with in the other four most significant digits the complement of the second number is obtained by leaving the least significant  unchanged and complementing all other digits in the previous definitions it was assumed that the numbers did not have radix point if the original number contains radix point the point should be removed temporarily in order to form the rs or  complement the radix point is then restored to the complemented number in the same relative position it is also worth mentioning that the complement of the complement restores the number to its original value to see this relationship note that the rs complement of is n so that the complement of the complement is n n  and is equal to the original number subtraction with complements the direct method of subtraction taught in elementary schools uses the borrow concept in this method we borrow  from higher significant position when the minuend digit is smaller than the subtrahend digit the method works well when people perform subtraction with paper and pencil however when subtraction is implemented with digital hardware the method is less efficient than the method that uses complements the subtraction of two digit unsigned numbers n in base can be done as follows   add the minuend to the rs complement of the subtrahend mathematically  n  n  n   if n the sum will produce an end carry n which can be discarded what is left is the result n   if  the sum does not produce an end carry and is equal to n m  which is the rs complement of m  to obtain the answer in familiar form take the rs complement of the sum and place negative sign in front the following examples illustrate the procedure example   using  complement subtract            complement of      sum     discard end carry       answer     note that has five digits and has only four digits both numbers must have the same number of digits so we write as    taking the  complement of produces  in the most significant position the occurrence of the end carry signifies that n and that the result is therefore positive section   complements of numbers  example   using  complement subtract            complement of      sum     there is no end carry therefore the answer is   complement of         note that since        the result is negative because we are dealing with unsigned numbers there is really no way to get an unsigned result for this case when subtracting with complements we recognize the negative answer from the absence of the end carry and the complemented result when working with paper and pencil we can change the answer to signed negative number in order to put it in familiar form subtraction with complements is done with binary numbers in similar manner using the procedure outlined previously example   given the two binary numbers      and      perform the subtraction x and y by using complements  x       complement of       sum      discard end carry        answer y      y       complement of       sum      there is no end carry therefore the answer is x    complement of           subtraction of unsigned numbers can also be done by means of the  complement remember that the  complement is one less than the rs complement because of this the result of adding the minuend to the complement of the subtrahend produces sum that is one less than the correct difference when an end carry occurs removing the end carry and adding  to the sum is referred to as an end around carry example   repeat example   but this time using complement  x                complement of       sum      end around carry    answer y      y                complement of       sum      there is no end carry therefore the answer is x    complement of           note that the negative result is obtained by taking the complement of the sum since this is the type of complement used the procedure with end around carry is also applicable to subtracting unsigned decimal numbers with complement   signed binary numbers positive integers including zero can be represented as unsigned numbers however to represent negative integers we need notation for negative values in ordinary arithmetic negative number is indicated by minus sign and positive number by plus sign because of hardware limitations computers must represent everything with binary digits it is customary to represent the sign with bit placed in the leftmost position of the number the convention is to make the sign bit  for positive and  for negative it is important to realize that both signed and unsigned binary numbers consist of string of bits when represented in computer the user determines whether the number is signed or unsigned if the binary number is signed then the leftmost bit represents the sign and the rest of the bits represent the number if the binary number is assumed to be unsigned then the leftmost bit is the most significant bit of the number for example the string of bits    can be considered as  unsigned binary or as   signed binary because the leftmost bit is  the string of bits    represents the binary equivalent of  when considered as an unsigned number and the binary equivalent of  when considered as signed number this is because the  that is in the leftmost position designates negative and the other four bits represent binary  usually there is no confusion in interpreting the bits if the type of representation for the number is known in advance section   signed binary numbers  the representation of the signed numbers in the last example is referred to as the signed magnitude convention in this notation the number consists of magnitude and symbol   or  or bit  or  indicating the sign this is the representation of signed numbers used in ordinary arithmetic when arithmetic operations are implemented in computer it is more convenient to use different system referred to as the signed complement system for representing negative numbers in this system negative number is indicated by its complement whereas the signed magnitude system negates number by changing its sign the signed complement system negates number by taking its complement since positive numbers always start with  plus in the leftmost position the complement will always start with  indicating negative number the signed complement system can use either the or the complement but the complement is the most common as an example consider the number  represented in binary with eight bits   is represented with sign bit of  in the leftmost position followed by the binary equivalent of  which gives      note that all eight bits must have value therefore  are inserted following the sign bit up to the first  although there is only one way to represent   there are three different ways to represent  with eight bits signed magnitude representation      signed complement representation      signed complement representation      in signed magnitude  is obtained from   by changing only the sign bit in the leftmost position from  to  in signed complement   is obtained by complementing all the bits of   including the sign bit the signed complement representation of  is obtained by taking the complement of the positive number including the sign bit table   lists all possible four bit signed binary numbers in the three representations the equivalent decimal number is also shown for reference note that the positive numbers in all three representations are identical and have  in the leftmost position the signed complement system has only one representation for  which is always positive the other two systems have either positive  or negative  something not encountered in ordinary arithmetic note that all negative numbers have  in the leftmost bit position that is the way we distinguish them from the positive numbers with four bits we can represent  binary numbers in the signed magnitude and the complement representations there are eight positive numbers and eight negative numbers including two zeros in the complement representation there are eight positive numbers including one zero and eight negative numbers the signed magnitude system is used in ordinary arithmetic but is awkward when employed in computer arithmetic because of the separate handling of the sign and the magnitude therefore the signed complement system is normally used the complement imposes some difficulties and is seldom used for arithmetic operations it is useful as logical operation since the change of  to  or  to  is equivalent to logical complement operation as will be shown in the next chapter the discussion of signed binary arithmetic that follows deals exclusively with the signed complement table   signed binary numbers decimal signed signed signed complement complement magnitude                                                                                                                                                  representation of negative numbers the same procedures can be applied to the signed complement system by including the end around carry as is done with unsigned numbers arithmetic addition the addition of two numbers in the signed magnitude system follows the rules of ordinary arithmetic if the signs are the same we add the two magnitudes and give the sum the common sign if the signs are different we subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger and give the difference the sign of the larger magnitude for example                  is done by subtracting the smaller magnitude   from the larger magnitude   and appending the sign of  to the result this is process that requires comparison of the signs and magnitudes and then performing either addition or subtraction the same procedure applies to binary numbers in signed magnitude representation in contrast the rule for adding numbers in the signed complement system does not require comparison or subtraction but only addition the procedure is very simple and can be stated as follows for binary numbers the addition of two signed binary numbers with negative numbers represented in signed complement form is obtained from the addition of the two numbers including their sign bits carry out of the sign bit position is discarded section   signed binary numbers  numerical examples for addition follow                                                                            note that negative numbers must be initially in complement form and that if the sum obtained after the addition is negative it is in complement form for example   is represented as      which is the complement of   in each of the four cases the operation performed is addition with the sign bit included any carry out of the sign bit position is discarded and negative results are automatically in complement form in order to obtain correct answer we must ensure that the result has sufficient number of bits to accommodate the sum if we start with two bit numbers and the sum occupies   bits we say that an overflow occurs when one performs the addition with paper and pencil an overflow is not problem because we are not limited by the width of the page we just add another  to positive number or another  to negative number in the most significant position to extend the number to   bits and then perform the addition overflow is problem in computers because the number of bits that hold number is finite and result that exceeds the finite value by  cannot be accommodated the complement form of representing negative numbers is unfamiliar to those used to the signed magnitude system to determine the value of negative number in signed complement it is necessary to convert the number to positive number to place it in more familiar form for example the signed binary number     is negative because the leftmost bit is  its complement is      which is the binary equivalent of   we therefore recognize the original negative number to be equal to   arithmetic subtraction subtraction of two signed binary numbers when negative numbers are in complement form is simple and can be stated as follows take the complement of the subtrahend including the sign bit and add it to the minuend including the sign bit  carry out of the sign bit position is discarded this procedure is adopted because subtraction operation can be changed to an addition operation if the sign of the subtrahend is changed as is demonstrated by the following relationship                  but changing positive number to negative number is easily done by taking the complement of the positive number the reverse is also true because the complement of negative number in complement form produces the equivalent positive number to see this consider the subtraction          in binary with eight bits this operation is written as            the subtraction is changed to addition by taking the complement of the subtrahend    giving     in binary this is                 removing the end carry we obtain the correct answer          it is worth noting that binary numbers in the signed complement system are added and subtracted by the same basic addition and subtraction rules as unsigned numbers therefore computers need only one common hardware circuit to handle both types of arithmetic this consideration has resulted in the signed complement system being used in virtually all arithmetic units of computer systems the user or programmer must interpret the results of such addition or subtraction differently depending on whether it is assumed that the numbers are signed or unsigned   binary codes digital systems use signals that have two distinct values and circuit elements that have two stable states there is direct analogy among binary signals binary circuit elements and binary digits binary number of digits for example may be represented by binary circuit elements each having an output signal equivalent to  or  digital systems represent and manipulate not only binary numbers but also many other discrete elements of information any discrete element of information that is distinct among group of quantities can be represented with binary code e  pattern of and  the codes must be in binary because in todays technology only circuits that represent and manipulate patterns of and can be manufactured economically for use in computers however it must be realized that binary codes merely change the symbols not the meaning of the elements of information that they represent if we inspect the bits of computer at random we will find that most of the time they represent some type of coded information rather than binary numbers an bit binary code is group of bits that assumes up to distinct combinations of and with each combination representing one element of the set that is being coded set of four elements can be coded with two bits with each element assigned one of the following bit combinations         set of eight elements requires three bit code and set of  elements requires four bit code the bit combination of an bit code is determined from the count in binary from  to  each element must be assigned unique binary bit combination and no two elements can have the same value otherwise the code assignment will be ambiguous although the minimum number of bits required to code distinct quantities is there is no maximum number of bits that may be used for binary code for example the  decimal digits can be coded with  bits and each decimal digit can be assigned bit combination of nine and  in this particular binary code the digit  is assigned the bit combination       section   binary codes  binary coded decimal code although the binary number system is the most natural system for computer because it is readily represented in todays electronic technology most people are more accustomed to the decimal system one way to resolve this difference is to convert decimal numbers to binary perform all arithmetic calculations in binary and then convert the binary results back to decimal this method requires that we store decimal numbers in the computer so that they can be converted to binary since the computer can accept only binary values we must represent the decimal digits by means of code that contains and it is also possible to perform the arithmetic operations directly on decimal numbers when they are stored in the computer in coded form binary code will have some unassigned bit combinations if the number of elements in the set is not multiple power of  the  decimal digits form such set binary code that distinguishes among  elements must contain at least four bits but  out of the  possible combinations remain unassigned different binary codes can be obtained by arranging four bits into  distinct combinations the code most commonly used for the decimal digits is the straight binary assignment listed in table   this scheme is called binary coded decimal and is commonly referred to as bcd other decimal codes are possible and few of them are presented later in this section table   gives the four bit code for one decimal digit number with decimal digits will require bits in bcd decimal   is represented in bcd with  bits as         with each group of  bits representing one decimal digit decimal number in bcd is the same as its equivalent binary number only when the number is between  and  bcd number greater than  looks different from its equivalent binary number even though both contain and moreover the binary combinations   through   are not used and have no meaning in bcd consider decimal   and its corresponding value in bcd and binary              bcd        table   binary coded decimal bcd decimal bcd symbol digit                                    the bcd value has  bits to encode the characters of the decimal value but the equivalent binary number needs only  bits it is obvious that the representation of bcd number needs more bits than its equivalent binary value however there is an advantage in the use of decimal numbers because computer input and output data are generated by people who use the decimal system it is important to realize that bcd numbers are decimal numbers and not binary numbers although they use bits in their representation the only difference between decimal number and bcd is that decimals are written with the symbols       and bcd numbers use the binary code              the decimal value is exactly the same decimal  is represented in bcd with eight bits as      and decimal  as      the corresponding binary values are   and   and have only four bits bcd addition consider the addition of two decimal digits in bcd together with possible carry from previous less significant pair of digits since each digit does not exceed  the sum cannot be greater than         with the  being previous carry suppose we add the bcd digits as if they were binary numbers then the binary sum will produce result in the range from  to   in binary this range will be from   to    but in bcd it is from   to     with the first e  leftmost  being carry and the next four bits being the bcd sum when the binary sum is equal to or less than    without carry  the corresponding bcd digit is correct however when the binary sum is greater than or equal to    the result is an invalid bcd digit the addition of       to the binary sum converts it to the correct digit and also produces carry as required this is because carry in the most significant bit position of the binary sum and decimal carry differ by      consider the following three bcd additions                                                  in each case the two bcd digits are added as if they were two binary numbers if the binary sum is greater than or equal to    we add   to obtain the correct bcd sum and carry in the first example the sum is equal to  and is the correct bcd sum in the second example the binary sum produces an invalid bcd digit the addition of   produces the correct bcd sum    e  the number   and carry in the third example the binary sum produces carry this condition occurs when the sum is greater than or equal to   although the other four bits are less than    the binary sum requires correction because of the carry adding    we obtain the required bcd sum    e  the number  and bcd carry section   binary codes  the addition of two digit unsigned bcd numbers follows the same procedure consider the addition of         in bcd bcd                  binary sum         add            bcd sum           the first least significant pair of bcd digits produces bcd digit sum of   and carry for the next pair of digits the second pair of bcd digits plus previous carry produces digit sum of   and carry for the next pair of digits the third pair of digits plus carry produces binary sum of   and does not require correction decimal arithmetic the representation of signed decimal numbers in bcd is similar to the representation of signed numbers in binary we can use either the familiar signed magnitude system or the signed complement system the sign of decimal number is usually represented with four bits to conform to the four bit code of the decimal digits it is customary to designate plus with four and minus with the bcd equivalent of  which is    the signed magnitude system is seldom used in computers the signed complement system can be either the or the  complement but the  complement is the one most often used to obtain the  complement of bcd number we first take the complement and then add  to the least significant digit the complement is calculated from the subtraction of each digit from  the procedures developed for the signed complement system in the previous section also apply to the signed  complement system for decimal numbers addition is done by summing all digits including the sign digit and discarding the end carry this operation assumes that all negative numbers are in  complement form consider the addition              done in the signed complement system           the  in the leftmost position of the second number represents minus and   is the  complement of    the two numbers are added and the end carry is discarded to obtain    of course the decimal numbers inside the computer including the sign digits must be in bcd the addition is done with bcd digits as described previously the subtraction of decimal numbers either unsigned or in the signed  complement system is the same as in the binary case take the  complement of the subtrahend and add it to the minuend many computers have special hardware to perform arithmetic calculations directly with decimal numbers in bcd the user of the computer can specify programmed instructions to perform the arithmetic operation with decimal numbers directly without having to convert them to binary other decimal codes binary codes for decimal digits require minimum of four bits per digit many different codes can be formulated by arranging four bits into  distinct combinations bcd and three other representative codes are shown in table   each code uses only  out of possible  bit combinations that can be arranged with four bits the other six unused combinations have no meaning and should be avoided bcd and the   code are examples of weighted codes in weighted code each bit position is assigned weighting factor in such way that each digit can be evaluated by adding the weights of all the in the coded combination the bcd code has weights of     and  which correspond to the power of two values of each bit the bit assignment    for example is interpreted by the weights to represent decimal  because                  the bit combination    when weighted by the respective digits    gives the decimal equivalent of                  note that some digits can be coded in two possible ways in the   code for instance decimal  can be assigned to bit combination   or    since both combinations add up to total weight of  table   four different binary codes for the decimal digits decimal bcd   excess       digit                                                                                                                                unused        bit        combi        nations                       section   binary codes  bcd adders add bcd values directly digit by digit without converting the numbers to binary however it is necessary to add  to the result if it is greater than  bcd adders require significantly more hardware and no longer have speed advantage of conventional binary adders   the   and the excess  codes are examples of self complementing codes such codes have the property that the complement of decimal number is obtained directly by changing to and to i  by complementing each bit in the pattern  for example decimal   is represented in the excess  code as         the complement of   is represented as         which is obtained simply by complementing each bit of the code as with the complement of binary numbers  the excess  code has been used in some older computers because of its self complementing property excess  is an unweighted code in which each coded combination is obtained from the corresponding binary value plus  note that the bcd code is not self complementing the       code is an example of assigning both positive and negative weights to decimal code in this case the bit combination   is interpreted as decimal  and is calculated from                      gray code the output data of many physical systems are quantities that are continuous these data must be converted into digital form before they are applied to digital system continuous or analog information is converted into digital form by means of an analog to digital converter it is sometimes convenient to use the gray code shown in table   to represent digital data that have been converted from analog data the advantage of the gray code over the straight binary number sequence is that only one bit in the code group changes in going from one number to the next for example in going from  to  the gray code changes from   to    only the first bit changes from  to  the other three bits remain the same by contrast with binary numbers the change from  to  will be from   to    which causes all four bits to change values the gray code is used in applications in which the normal sequence of binary numbers generated by the hardware may produce an error or ambiguity during the transition from one number to the next if binary numbers are used change for example from   to   may produce an intermediate erroneous number   if the value of the rightmost bit takes longer to change than do the values of the other three bits this could have serious consequences for the machine using the information the gray code eliminates this problem since only one bit changes its value during any transition between two numbers typical application of the gray code is the representation of analog data by continuous change in the angular position of shaft the shaft is partitioned into segments and each segment is assigned number if adjacent segments are made to correspond with the gray code sequence ambiguity is eliminated between the angle of the shaft and the value encoded by the sensor table   decimal gray code equivalent gray  code                                                           ascii character code many applications of digital computers require the handling not only of numbers but also of other characters or symbols such as the letters of the alphabet for instance consider high tech company with thousands of employees to represent the names and other pertinent information it is necessary to formulate binary code for the letters of the alphabet in addition the same binary code must represent numerals and special characters such as   an alphanumeric character set is set of elements that includes the  decimal digits the  letters of the alphabet and number of special characters such set contains between  and  elements if only capital letters are included or between  and   elements if both uppercase and lowercase letters are included in the first case we need binary code of six bits and in the second we need binary code of seven bits the standard binary code for the alphanumeric characters is the american standard code for information interchange ascii  which uses seven bits to code   characters as shown in table   the seven bits of the code are designated by through  with the most significant bit the letter for example is represented in ascii as     column   row    the ascii code also contains  graphic characters that can be printed and  nonprinting characters used for various control functions the graphic characters consist of the  uppercase letters through  the  lowercase letters through  the  numerals  through   and  special printable characters such as    and  section   binary codes  table

again below the table with their functional names the control characters are used for routing data and arranging the printed text into prescribed format there are three types of control characters format effectors information separators and communication control characters format effectors are characters that control the layout of printing they include the familiar word processor and typewriter controls such as backspace bs  horizontal tabulation ht  and carriage return cr  information separators are used to separate the data into divisions such as paragraphs and pages they include characters such as record separator rs and file separator fs  the communication control characters are useful during the transmission of text between remote devices so that it can be distinguished from other messages using the same communication channel before it and after it examples of communication control characters are stx start of text and etx end of text  which are used to frame text message transmitted through communication channel ascii is seven bit code but most computers manipulate an eight bit quantity as single unit called byte therefore ascii characters most often are stored one per byte the extra bit is sometimes used for other purposes depending on the application for example some printers recognize eight bit ascii characters with the most significant bit set to  an additional   eight bit characters with the most significant bit set to  are used for other symbols such as the greek alphabet or italic type font error detecting code to detect errors in data communication and processing an eighth bit is sometimes added to the ascii character to indicate its parity parity bit is an extra bit included with message to make the total number of either even or odd consider the following two characters and their even and odd parity ascii      with even parity with odd parity ascii                        in each case we insert an extra bit in the leftmost position of the code to produce an even number of in the character for even parity or an odd number of in the character for odd parity in general one or the other parity is adopted with even parity being more common the parity bit is helpful in detecting errors during the transmission of information from one location to another this function is handled by generating an even parity bit at the sending end for each character the eight bit characters that include parity bits are transmitted to their destination the parity of each character is then checked at the receiving end if the parity of the received character is not even then at least one bit has changed value during the transmission this method detects one three or any odd combination of errors in each character that is transmitted an even combination of errors however goes undetected and additional error detection codes may be needed to take care of that possibility what is done after an error is detected depends on the particular application one possibility is to request retransmission of the message on the assumption that the error was random and will not occur again thus if the receiver detects parity error it sends section   binary storage and registers  back the ascii nak negative acknowledge control character consisting of an even parity eight bits      if no error is detected the receiver sends back an ack acknowledge control character namely      the sending end will respond to an nak by transmitting the message again until the correct parity is received if after number of attempts the transmission is still in error message can be sent to the operator to check for malfunctions in the transmission path   binary storage and registers the binary information in digital computer must have physical existence in some medium for storing individual bits binary cell is device that possesses two stable states and is capable of storing one bit  or  of information the input to the cell receives excitation signals that set it to one of the two states the output of the cell is physical quantity that distinguishes between the two states the information stored in cell is  when the cell is in one stable state and  when the cell is in the other stable state registers register is group of binary cells register with cells can store any discrete quantity of information that contains bits the state of register is an tuple of and with each bit designating the state of one cell in the register the content of register is function of the interpretation given to the information stored in it consider for example  bit register with the following binary content          register with  cells can be in one of   possible states if one assumes that the content of the register represents binary integer then the register can store any binary number from  to    for the particular example shown the content of the register is the binary equivalent of the decimal number     if one assumes instead that the register stores alphanumeric characters of an eight bit code then the content of the register is any two meaningful characters for the ascii code with an even parity placed in the eighth most significant bit position the register contains the two characters the leftmost eight bits and the rightmost eight bits  if however one interprets the content of the register to be four decimal digits represented by four bit code then the content of the register is four digit decimal number in the excess  code the register holds the decimal number    the content of the register is meaningless in bcd because the bit combination   is not assigned to any decimal digit from this example it is clear that register can store discrete elements of information and that the same bit configuration may be interpreted differently for different types of data depending on the application register transfer digital system is characterized by its registers and the components that perform data processing in digital systems register transfer operation is basic operation that consists of transfer of binary information from one set of registers into another set of registers the transfer may be direct from one register to another or may pass through data processing circuits to perform an operation figure   illustrates the transfer of information among registers and demonstrates pictorially the transfer of binary information from keyboard into register in the memory unit the input unit is assumed to have keyboard control circuit and an input register each time key is struck the control circuit enters an equivalent eight bit alphanumeric character code into the input register we shall assume that the code used is the ascii code with an odd parity bit the information from the input register is transferred into the eight least significant cells of processor register after every transfer the input register is cleared to enable the control to insert new eight bit code when the keyboard is struck again each eight bit character transferred to the processor register is preceded by shift of the previous character to the next eight cells on its left when transfer of four characters is completed the processor register is full and its contents are transferred into memory register the content stored in the memory unit o n                 memory register processor unit  cells  cells

fig   came from the transfer of the characters o and after the four appropriate keys were struck to process discrete quantities of information in binary form computer must be provided with devices that hold the data to be processed and with circuit elements that manipulate individual bits of information the device most commonly used for holding data is register binary variables are manipulated by means of digital logic circuits figure   illustrates the process of adding two  bit binary numbers the memory unit which normally consists of millions of registers is shown with only three of its registers the part of the processor unit shown consists of three registersr   and together with digital logic circuits that manipulate the bits of and and transfer into a binary number equal to their arithmetic sum memory registers store information and are incapable of processing the two operands however the information stored in memory can be transferred to processor registers and the results obtained in processor registers can be transferred back into memory register for storage until needed again the diagram shows the contents of two operands transferred from two memory registers memory

flow capabilities of digital system in simple manner the registers of the system are the basic elements for storing and holding the binary information digital logic circuits process the binary information stored in the registers digital logic circuits and registers are covered in chapters  through  the memory unit is explained in chapter  the description of register operations at the register transfer level and the design of digital systems are covered in chapter    binary logic binary logic deals with variables that take on two discrete values and with operations that assume logical meaning the two values the variables assume may be called by different names true and false yes and no etc  but for our purpose it is convenient to think in terms of bits and assign the values  and  the binary logic introduced in this section is equivalent to an algebra called boolean algebra the formal presentation of boolean algebra is covered in more detail in chapter  the purpose of this section is to introduce boolean algebra in heuristic manner and relate it to digital logic circuits and binary signals definition of binary logic binary logic consists of binary variables and set of logical operations the variables are designated by letters of the alphabet such as b x z etc  with each variable having two and only two distinct possible values  and  there are three basic logical operations and or and not each operation produces binary result denoted by   and this operation is represented by dot or by the absence of an operator for example   or xy  is read and is equal to the logical operation and is interpreted to mean that   if and only if   and   otherwise    remember that y and are binary variables and can be equal either to  or  and nothing else  the result of the operation  is   or this operation is represented by plus sign for example   is read or is equal to meaning that   if   or if   or if both   and   if both   and   then     not this operation is represented by prime sometimes by an overbar  for example  or  is read not is equal to meaning that is what is not in other words if   then   but if   then   the not operation is also referred to as the complement operation since it changes  to  and  to  e  the result of complementing  is  and vice versa binary logic resembles binary arithmetic and the operations and and or have similarities to multiplication and addition respectively in fact the symbols used for table   section   binary logic  truth tables of logical operations not and or x   y y y y                       and and or are the same as those used for multiplication and addition however binary logic should not be confused with binary arithmetic one should realize that an arithmetic variable designates number that may consist of many digits logic variable is always either  or  for example in binary arithmetic we have       read one plus one is equal to   whereas in binary logic we have      read one or one is equal to one  for each combination of the values of and there is value of specified by the definition of the logical operation definitions of logical operations may be listed in compact form called truth tables truth table is table of all possible combinations of the variables showing the relation between the values that the variables may take and the result of the operation the truth tables for the operations and and or with variables and are obtained by listing all possible values that the variables may have when combined in pairs for each combination the result of the operation is then listed in separate row the truth tables for and or and not are given in table   these tables clearly demonstrate the definition of the operations logic gates logic gates are electronic circuits that operate on one or more input signals to produce an output signal electrical signals such as voltages or currents exist as analog signals having values over given continuous range say  to  but in digital system these voltages are interpreted to be either of two recognizable values  or  voltage operated logic circuits respond to two separate voltage levels that represent binary variable equal to logic  or logic  for example particular digital system may define logic  as signal equal to  and logic  as signal equal to  in practice each voltage level has an acceptable range as shown in fig    the input terminals of digital circuits accept binary signals within the allowable range and respond at the output terminals with binary signals that fall within the specified range the intermediate region between the allowed regions is crossed only during state transition any desired information for computing or control can be operated on by passing binary signals through various combinations of logic gates with each signal representing particular binary variable when the physical signal is in particular range it is interpreted to be either  or  volts  signal range for logic   transition occurs

logic requirements are satisfied the input signals and in the and and or gates may exist in one of four possible states       or   these input signals are shown in fig   together with the corresponding output signal for each gate the timing diagrams illustrate the idealized response of each gate to the four input signal combinations the horizontal axis of the timing diagram represents the time and the vertical axis shows the signal as it changes between the two possible voltage levels in reality the transitions between logic values occur quickly but not instantaneously the low level represents logic  the high level logic  the and gate responds with logic  output signal when both input signals are logic  the or gate responds with logic  output signal if any input signal is

it is an important factor addressed by designersbe they computer engineers electrical engineers or computer scientists finding simpler and cheaper but equivalent realizations of circuit can reap huge payoffs in reducing the overall cost of the design mathematical methods that simplify circuits rely primarily on boolean algebra therefore this chapter provides basic vocabulary and brief foundation in boolean algebra that will enable you to optimize simple circuits and to understand the purpose of algorithms used by software tools to optimize complex circuits involving millions of logic gates   basic definitions  boolean algebra like any other deductive mathematical system may be defined with set of elements set of operators and number of unproved axioms or postulates set of elements is any collection of objects usually having common property if is set and and are certain objects then the notation h means that is member of the set and x means that is not an element of a set with denumerable number of elements is specified by braces        indicates that the elements of set are the numbers     and  binary operator defined on set of elements is rule that assigns to each pair of elements from a unique element from as an example consider the relation   we say that  is binary operator if it specifies rule for finding from the pair b and also if b h however  is not binary operator if b s and if x section   basic definitions  the postulates of mathematical system form the basic assumptions from which it is possible to deduce the rules theorems and properties of the system the most common postulates used to formulate various algebraic structures are as follows   closure set is closed with respect to binary operator if for every pair of elements of the binary operator specifies rule for obtaining unique element of for example the set of natural numbers        is closed with respect to the binary operator  by the rules of arithmetic addition since for any b n there is unique h such that   the set of natural numbers is not closed with respect to the binary operator by the rules of arithmetic subtraction because     and   n but    n   associative law binary operator  on set is said to be associative whenever      for all y h  commutative law binary operator  on set is said to be commutative whenever    for all y s  identity element set is said to have an identity element with respect to binary operation  on if there exists an element h with the property that     for every h example the element  is an identity element with respect to the binary operator  on the set of integers                since       for any h the set of natural numbers has no identity element since  is excluded from the set   inverse set having the identity element with respect to binary operator  is said to have an inverse whenever for every h there exists an element h such that y  example in the set of integers and the operator  with   the inverse of an element is   since       distributive law if  and  are two binary operators on set  is said to be distributive over  whenever         a field is an example of an algebraic structure field is set of elements together with two binary operators each having properties  through  and both operators combining to give property  the set of real numbers together with the binary operators  and   forms the field of real numbers the field of real numbers is the basis for arithmetic and ordinary algebra the operators and postulates have the following meanings the binary operator  defines addition the additive identity is  the additive inverse defines subtraction the binary operator  defines multiplication the multiplicative identity is  for  the multiplicative inverse of   defines division e       the only distributive law applicable is that of  over            axiomatic definition of boolean algebra in    george boole developed an algebraic system now called boolean algebra in    claude shannon introduced two valued boolean algebra called switching algebra that represented the properties of bistable electrical switching circuits for the formal definition of boolean algebra we shall employ the postulates formulated by v huntington in    boolean algebra is an algebraic structure defined by set of elements together with two binary operators  and   provided that the following huntington postulates are satisfied   the structure is closed with respect to the operator   the structure is closed with respect to the operator     the element  is an identity element with respect to  that is        the element  is an identity element with respect to   that is         the structure is commutative with respect to  that is     the structure is commutative with respect to   that is      the operator  is distributive over  that is          the operator  is distributive over   that is           for every element h there exists an element h called the complement of such that x    and x      there exist at least two elements y b such that y comparing boolean algebra with arithmetic and ordinary algebra the field of real numbers  we note the following differences   huntington postulates do not include the associative law however this law holds for boolean algebra and can be derived for both operators from the other postulates   the distributive law of  over  e           is valid for boolean algebra but not for ordinary algebra section   axiomatic definition of boolean algebra    boolean algebra does not have additive or multiplicative inverses therefore there are no subtraction or division operations   postulate  defines an operator called the complement that is not available in ordinary algebra   ordinary algebra deals with the real numbers which constitute an infinite set of elements boolean algebra deals with the as yet undefined set of elements but in the two valued boolean algebra defined next and of interest in our subsequent use of that algebra  is defined as set with only two elements  and  boolean algebra resembles ordinary algebra in some respects the choice of the symbols  and  is intentional to facilitate boolean algebraic manipulations by persons already familiar with ordinary algebra although one can use some knowledge from ordinary algebra to deal with boolean algebra the beginner must be careful not to substitute the rules of ordinary algebra where they are not applicable it is important to distinguish between the elements of the set of an algebraic structure and the variables of an algebraic system for example the elements of the field of real numbers are numbers whereas variables such as b etc  used in ordinary algebra are symbols that stand for real numbers similarly in boolean algebra one defines the elements of the set and variables such as y and are merely symbols that represent the elements at this point it is important to realize that in order to have boolean algebra one must show that  the elements of the set   the rules of operation for the two binary operators and  the set of elements together with the two operators satisfy the six huntington postulates one can formulate many boolean algebras depending on the choice of elements of and the rules of operation in our subsequent work we deal only with two valued boolean algebra e  boolean algebra with only two elements  two valued boolean algebra has applications in set theory the algebra of classes and in propositional logic our interest here is in the application of boolean algebra to gate type circuits commonly used in digital devices and computers two valued boolean algebra two valued boolean algebra is defined on set of two elements      with rules for the two binary operators  and  as shown in the following operator tables the rule for the complement operator is for verification of postulate   y y y xy x                             these rules are exactly the same as the and or and not operations respectively defined in table   we must now show that the huntington postulates are valid for the set     and the two binary operators  and    that the structure is closed with respect to the two operators is obvious from the tables since the result of each operation is either  or  and   b   from the tables we see that                               this establishes the two identity elements  for  and  for   as defined by postulate    the commutative laws are obvious from the symmetry of the binary operator tables   the distributive law         can be shown to hold from the operator tables by forming truth table of all possible values of y and for each combination we derive   and show that the value is the same as the value of      xy y x  z  x  x                                                                 the distributive law of  over  can be shown to hold by means of truth table similar to the one in part   from the complement table it is easily shown that x    since          and           x    since          and          thus postulate  is verified   postulate  is satisfied because the two valued boolean algebra has two elements  and  with   we have just established two valued boolean algebra having set of two elements  and  two binary operators with rules equivalent to the and and or operations and complement operator equivalent to the not operator thus boolean algebra has been defined in formal mathematical manner and has been shown to be equivalent to the binary logic presented heuristically in section   the heuristic presentation is helpful in understanding the application of boolean algebra to gate type circuits the formal section   basic theorems and properties of boolean algebra  presentation is necessary for developing the theorems and properties of the algebraic system the two valued boolean algebra defined in this section is also called switching algebra by engineers to emphasize the similarities between two valued boolean algebra and other binary systems that algebra was called binary logic in section   from here on we shall drop the adjective two valued from boolean algebra in subsequent discussions   basic theorems and properties of boolean algebra duality in section   the huntington postulates were listed in pairs and designated by part and part  one part may be obtained from the other if the binary operators and the identity elements are interchanged this important property of boolean algebra is called the duality principle and states that every algebraic expression deducible from the postulates of boolean algebra remains valid if the operators and identity elements are interchanged in two valued boolean algebra the identity elements and the elements of the set are the same  and  the duality principle has many applications if the dual of an algebraic expression is desired we simply interchange or and and operators and replace by and by basic theorems table   lists six theorems of boolean algebra and four of its postulates the notation is simplified by omitting the binary operator whenever doing so does not lead to confusion the theorems and postulates listed are the most basic relationships in boolean table   postulates and theorems

together define the complement of the complement of is and is also  section   basic theorems and properties of boolean algebra  therefore since the complement is unique we have  the theorems involving two or three variables may be proven algebraically from the postulates and the theorems that have already been proven take for example the absorption theorem theorem    xy  statement justification postulate  x  xy     xy       y       theorem   x   by duality the theorems of boolean algebra can be proven by means of truth tables in truth tables both sides of the relation are checked to see whether they yield identical results for all possible combinations of the variables involved the following truth table verifies the first absorption theorem y xy xy                 the algebraic proofs of the associative law and demorgans theorem are long and will not be shown here however their validity is easily shown with truth tables for example the truth table for the first demorgans theorem    xy is as follows y y y y xy                         operator precedence the operator precedence for evaluating boolean expressions is   parentheses   not   and and   or in other words expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated before all other operations the next operation that holds precedence is the complement and then follows the and and finally the or as an example consider the truth table for one of demorgans theorems the left side of the expression is   therefore the expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first and the result then complemented the right side of the expression is xy so the complement of and the complement of are both evaluated first and the result is then anded note that in ordinary arithmetic the same precedence holds except for the complement when multiplication and addition are replaced by and and or respectively   boolean functions boolean algebra is an algebra that deals with binary variables and logic operations boolean function described by an algebraic expression consists of binary variables the constants  and  and the logic operation symbols for given value of the binary variables the function can be equal to either  or  as an example consider the boolean function   yz the function is equal to  if is equal to  or if both and are equal to  is equal to  otherwise the complement operation dictates that when     therefore   if   or if   and   boolean function expresses the logical relationship between binary variables and is evaluated by determining the binary value of the expression for all possible values of the variables boolean function can be represented in truth table the number of rows in the truth table is where is the number of variables in the function the binary combinations for the truth table are obtained from the binary numbers by counting from  through  table   shows the truth table for the function  there are eight possible binary combinations for assigning bits to the three variables y and the column labeled contains either  or  for each of these combinations the table shows that the function is equal to  when   or when yz   and is equal to  otherwise boolean function can be transformed from an algebraic expression into circuit diagram composed of logic gates connected in particular structure the logic circuit diagram also called schematic for is shown in fig   there is an inverter for input to generate its complement there is an and gate for the term yz and an or gate table   truth tables for and x z f                                         section   boolean functions  f z figure   gate implementation of x yz that combines with yz in logic circuit diagrams the variables of the function are taken as the inputs of the circuit and the binary variable is taken as the output of the circuit the schematic expresses the relationship between the output of the circuit and its inputs rather than listing each combination of inputs and outputs it indicates how to compute the logic value of each output from the logic values of the inputs there is only one way that boolean function can be represented in truth table however when the function is in algebraic form it can be expressed in variety of ways all of which have equivalent logic the particular expression used to represent the function will dictate the interconnection of gates in the logic circuit diagram conversely the interconnection of gates will dictate the logic expression here is key fact that motivates our use of boolean algebra by manipulating boolean expression according to the rules of boolean algebra it is sometimes possible to obtain simpler expression for the same function and thus reduce the number of gates in the circuit and the number of inputs to the gate designers are motivated to reduce the complexity and number of gates because their effort can significantly reduce the cost of circuit consider for example the following boolean function  xyz  xyz  xy schematic of an implementation of this function with logic gates is shown in fig    input variables and are complemented with inverters to obtain and the three terms in the expression are implemented with three and gates the or gate forms the logical or of the three terms the truth table for is listed in table   the function is equal to  when xyz    or   or when xy    irrespective of the value of and is equal to  otherwise this set of conditions produces four and four for  now consider the possible simplification of the function by applying some of the identities of boolean algebra  xyz  xyz  xy  xz   xy  xz  xy the function is reduced to only two terms and can be implemented with gates as shown in fig    it is obvious that the circuit in is simpler than the one in  yet both implement the same function by means of truth table it is possible to verify that the two expressions are equivalent the simplified expression is equal to  when xz   or when xy    this produces the same four in the truth table since both expressions y f  f xyz xyz xy y z f xy xz figure   implementation of boolean function with gates produce the same truth table they are equivalent therefore the two circuits have the same outputs for all possible binary combinations of inputs of the three variables each circuit implements the same identical function but the one with fewer gates and fewer inputs to gates is preferable because it requires fewer wires and components in general there are many equivalent representations of logic function finding the most economic representation of the logic is an important design task algebraic manipulation when boolean expression is implemented with logic gates each term requires gate and each variable within the term designates an input to the gate we define literal to be single variable within term in complemented or uncomplemented form the function of fig   has three terms and eight literals and the one in fig   has two terms and four literals by reducing the number of terms the number of literals or both in boolean expression it is often possible to obtain simpler circuit the manipulation of boolean algebra consists mostly of reducing an expression for the purpose of obtaining simpler circuit functions of up to five variables can be simplified by the map method described in the next chapter for complex boolean functions and many section   boolean functions  different outputs designers of digital circuits use computer minimization programs that are capable of producing optimal circuits with millions of logic gates the concepts introduced in this chapter provide the framework for those tools the only manual method available is cut and try procedure employing the basic relations and other manipulation techniques that become familiar with use but remain nevertheless subject to human error the examples that follow illustrate the algebraic manipulation of boolean algebra to acquaint the reader with this important design task example   simplify the following boolean functions to minimum number of literals   x   xx  xy    xy  xy    xy   x          x    xy  xy  yy        xy  xz  yz  xy  xz  yz   xy  xz  xyz  xyz  xy    xz    xy  xz    x  y     x   by duality from function  functions  and  are the dual of each other and use dual expressions in corresponding steps an easier way to simplify function  is by means of postulate  from table     x    yy  the fourth function illustrates the fact that an increase in the number of literals sometimes leads to simpler final expression function  is not minimized directly but can be derived from the dual of the steps used to derive function  functions  and  are together known as the consensus theorem complement of function the complement of function is and is obtained from an interchange of for and for in the value of the complement of function may be derived algebraically through demorgans theorems listed in table   for two variables demorgans theorems can be extended to three or more variables the three variable form of the first demorgans theorem is derived as follows from postulates and theorems listed in table         let    ax by theorem   demorgan  b  substitute    bc by theorem   demorgan  abc by theorem   associative demorgans theorems for any number of variables resemble the two variable case in form and can be derived by successive substitutions similar to the method used in the preceding derivation these theorems can be generalized as follows        abcd f abcd f       the generalized form of demorgans theorems states that the complement of function is obtained by interchanging and and or operators and complementing each literal example   find the complement of the functions  xyz  xyz and  yz  yz  by applying demorgans theorems as many times as necessary the complements are obtained as follows   xyz  xyz   xyz xyz     x   f   yz  yz    yz  yz   yz yz    y    yz  yz simpler procedure for deriving the complement of function is to take the dual of the function and complement each literal this method follows from the generalized forms of demorgans theorems remember that the dual of function is obtained from the interchange of and and or operators and and example   find the complement of the functions and of example   by taking their duals and complementing each literal    xyz  xyz the dual of is   x    complement each literal    x        yz  yz  the dual of is   y   complement each literal   y    section   canonical and standard forms    canonical and standard forms minterms and maxterms binary variable may appear either in its normal form or in its complement form  now consider two binary variables and combined with an and operation since each variable may appear in either form there are four possible combinations xy xy xy and xy each of these four and terms is called minterm or standard product in similar manner variables can be combined to form minterms the different minterms may be determined by method similar to the one shown in table   for three variables the binary numbers from  to  are listed under the variables each minterm is obtained from an and term of the variables with each variable being primed if the corresponding bit of the binary number is  and unprimed if  symbol for each minterm is also shown in the table and is of the form mj where the subscript denotes the decimal equivalent of the binary number of the minterm designated in similar fashion variables forming an or term with each variable being primed or unprimed provide possible combinations called maxterms or standard sums the eight maxterms for three variables together with their symbolic designations are listed in table   any maxterms for variables may be determined similarly it is important to note that   each maxterm is obtained from an or term of the variables with each variable being unprimed if the corresponding bit is  and primed if  and   each maxterm is the complement of its corresponding minterm and vice versa boolean function can be expressed algebraically from given truth table by forming minterm for each combination of the variables that produces  in the function and then taking the or of all those terms for example the function in table   is determined by expressing the combinations      and   as xyz xyz and xyz respectively since each one of these minterms results in    we have  xyz  xyz  xyz    table   minterms and maxterms for three binary variables minterms maxterms y term designation term designation    xyz x z    xyz x   m    xyz x   m    xyz x   m    xyz x   m    xyz x   m    xyz x   m    xyz x   m table   functions of three variables y function function                                         similarly it may be easily verified that  xyz  xyz  xyz  xyz     these examples demonstrate an important property of boolean algebra any boolean function can be expressed as sum of minterms with sum meaning the oring of terms  now consider the complement of boolean function it may be read from the truth table by forming minterm for each combination that produces  in the function and then oring those terms the complement of is read as   xyz  xyz  xyz  xyz  xyz if we take the complement of  we obtain the function      x   x   x        similarly it is possible to read the expression for from the table     x   x   x    m m these examples demonstrate second property of boolean algebra any boolean function can be expressed as product of maxterms with product meaning the anding of terms  the procedure for obtaining the product of maxterms directly from the truth table is as follows form maxterm for each combination of the variables that produces  in the function and then form the and of all those maxterms boolean functions expressed as sum of minterms or product of maxterms are said to be in canonical form sum of minterms previously we stated that for binary variables one can obtain distinct minterms and that any boolean function can be expressed as sum of minterms the minterms whose sum defines the boolean function are those which give the of the function in section   canonical and standard forms  truth table since the function can be either  or  for each minterm and since there are minterms one can calculate all the functions that can be formed with variables to be  it is sometimes convenient to express boolean function in its sum of minterms form if the function is not in this form it can be made so by first expanding the expression into sum of and terms each term is then inspected to see if it contains all the variables if it misses one or more variables it is anded with an expression such as  where is one of the missing variables the next example clarifies this procedure example   express the boolean function   bc as sum of minterms the function has three variables b and the first term is missing two variables therefore  b   ab  ab this function is still missing one variable so  ab   ab   abc  abc  abc  abc the second term bc is missing one variable hence bc  bc   abc  abc combining all terms we have   bc  abc  abc  abc  abc  abc but abc appears twice and according to theorem     it is possible to remove one of those occurrences rearranging the minterms in ascending order we finally obtain  abc  abc  abc  abc  abc      when boolean function is in its sum of minterms form it is sometimes convenient to express the function in the following brief notation a c          the summation symbol stands for the oring of terms the numbers following it are the indices of the minterms of the function the letters in parentheses following form list of the variables in the order taken when the minterm is converted to an and term an alternative procedure for deriving the minterms of boolean function is to obtain the truth table of the function directly from the algebraic expression and then read the minterms from the truth table consider the boolean function given in example     bc the truth table shown in table   can be derived directly from the algebraic expression by listing the eight binary combinations under variables b and and inserting table   truth table for a bc b f                                 under for those combinations for which   and bc    from the truth table we can then read the five minterms of the function to be       and  product of maxterms each of the  functions of binary variables can be also expressed as product of maxterms to express boolean function as product of maxterms it must first be brought into form of or terms this may be done by using the distributive law  yz   x   then any missing variable in each or term is ored with xx the procedure is clarified in the following example example   express the boolean function  xy  xz as product of maxterms first convert the function into or terms by using the distributive law  xy  xz  xy  xy     y  x  y     x  y  the function has three variables y and each or term is missing one variable therefore     zz    x   x     yy    x   y     xx    x   combining all the terms and removing those which appear more than once we finally obtain    x   x   x    m m section   canonical and standard forms  convenient way to express this function is as follows x z         the product symbol  denotes the anding of maxterms the numbers are the indices of the maxterms of the function conversion between canonical forms the complement of function expressed as the sum of minterms equals the sum of minterms missing from the original function this is because the original function is expressed by those minterms which make the function equal to  whereas its complement is  for those minterms for which the function is  as an example consider the function a c          this function has complement that can be expressed as a c          now if we take the complement of by demorgans theorem we obtain in different form            m       the last conversion follows from the definition of minterms and maxterms as shown in table   from the table it is clear that the following relation holds mj  mj that is the maxterm with subscript is complement of the minterm with the same subscript and vice versa the last example demonstrates the conversion between function expressed in sum of minterms form and its equivalent in product of maxterms form similar argument will show that the conversion between the product of maxterms and the sum of minterms is similar we now state general conversion procedure to convert from one canonical form to another interchange the symbols and and list those numbers missing from the original form in order to find the missing terms one must realize that the total number of minterms or maxterms is where is the number of binary variables in the function boolean function can be converted from an algebraic expression to product of maxterms by means of truth table and the canonical conversion procedure consider for example the boolean expression  xy  xz first we derive the truth table of the function as shown in table   the under in the table are determined from the combination of the variables for which xy   or xz    the minterms of the function are read from the truth table to be     and  the function expressed as sum of minterms is x z         table   truth table for xy xz y f     minterms maxterms                             since there is total of eight minterms or maxterms in function of three variables we determine the missing terms to be     and  the function expressed as product of maxterms is x z         the same answer as obtained in example   standard forms the two canonical forms of boolean algebra are basic forms that one obtains from reading given function from the truth table these forms are very seldom the ones with the least number of literals because each minterm or maxterm must contain by definition all the variables either complemented or uncomplemented another way to express boolean functions is in standard form in this configuration the terms that form the function may contain one two or any number of literals there are two types of standard forms the sum of products and products of sums the sum of products is boolean expression containing and terms called product terms with one or more literals each the sum denotes the oring of these terms an example of function expressed as sum of products is   xy  xyz the expression has three product terms with one two and three literals their sum is in effect an or operation the logic diagram of sum of products expression consists of group of and gates followed by single or gate this configuration pattern is shown in fig    each product term requires an and gate except for term with single literal the logic sum is formed with an or gate whose inputs are the outputs of the and gates and the single literal it is assumed that the input variables are directly available in their complements so inverters are not included in the diagram this circuit configuration is referred to as two level implementation section   canonical and standard forms  x y f z x y z sum of products product of sums figure   two level implementation a b c d d c a ab d  ab cd ce figure   three and two level implementation product of sums is boolean expression containing or terms called sum terms each term may have any number of literals the product denotes the anding of these terms an example of function expressed as product of sums is  y  x   this expression has three sum terms with one two and three literals the product is an and operation the use of the words product and sum stems from the similarity of the and operation to the arithmetic product multiplication and the similarity of the or operation to the arithmetic sum addition  the gate structure of the product of sums expression consists of group of or gates for the sum terms except for single literal  followed by an and gate as shown in fig    this standard type of expression results in two level structure of gates boolean function may be expressed in nonstandard form for example the function  ab  d  is neither in sum of products nor in product of sums form the implementation of this expression is shown in fig   and requires two and gates and two or gates there are three levels of gating in this circuit it can be changed to standard form by using the distributive law to remove the parentheses  ab  d   ab  cd  ce the sum of products expression is implemented in fig    in general two level implementation is preferred because it produces the least amount of delay through the gates when the signal propagates from the inputs to the output however the number of inputs to given gate might not be practical   other logic operations when the binary operators and and or are placed between two variables and they form two boolean functions  and  respectively previously we stated that there are  functions for binary variables thus for two variables   and the number of possible boolean functions is   therefore the and and or functions are only  of total of  possible functions formed with two binary variables it would be instructive to find the other  functions and investigate their properties the truth tables for the  functions formed with two binary variables are listed in table   each of the  columns to  represents truth table of one possible function for the two variables and note that the functions are determined from the  binary combinations that can be assigned to the  functions can be expressed algebraically by means of boolean functions as is shown in the first column of table   the boolean expressions listed are simplified to their minimum number of literals although each function can be expressed in terms of the boolean operators and or and not there is no reason one cannot assign special operator symbols for expressing the other functions such operator symbols are listed in the second column of table   however of all the new symbols shown only the exclusive or symbol  is in common use by digital designers each of the functions in table   is listed with an accompanying name and comment that explains the function in some way  the  functions listed can be subdivided into three categories   two functions that produce constant  or    four functions with unary operations complement and transfer   ten functions with binary operators that define eight different operations and or nand nor exclusive or equivalence inhibition and implication table   truth tables for the  functions of two binary variables xy f f f f f

produces the complement of each of the binary variables function that is equal to an input variable has been given the name transfer because the variable or is transferred through the gate that forms the function without changing its value of the eight binary operators two inhibition and implication are used by logicians but are seldom used in computer logic the and and or operators have been mentioned in conjunction with boolean algebra the other four functions are used extensively in the design of digital systems the nor function is the complement of the or function and its name is an abbreviation of not or similarly nand is the complement of and and is an abbreviation of not and the exclusive or abbreviated xor is similar to or but excludes the combination of both and being equal to  it holds only when and differ in value  it is sometimes referred to as the binary difference operator  equivalence is function that is  when the two binary variables are equal e  when both are  or both are   the exclusive or and equivalence functions are the complements of each other this can be easily verified by inspecting table   the truth table for exclusive or is and for equivalence is  and these two functions are the complements of each other for this reason the equivalence function is called exclusive nor abbreviated xnor boolean algebra as defined in section   has two binary operators which we have called and and or and unary operator not complement  from the definitions we have deduced number of properties of these operators and now have defined other binary operators in terms of them there is nothing unique about this procedure we could have just as well started with the operator nor   for example and later defined and or and not in terms of it there are nevertheless good reasons for introducing boolean algebra in the way it has been introduced the concepts of and or and not are familiar and are used by people to express everyday logical ideas moreover the huntington postulates reflect the dual nature of the algebra emphasizing the symmetry of  and  with respect to each other   digital logic gates since boolean functions are expressed in terms of and or and not operations it is easier to implement boolean function with these type of gates still the possibility of constructing gates for the other logic operations is of practical interest factors to be weighed in considering the construction of other types of logic gates are   the feasibility and economy of producing the gate with physical components   the possibility of extending the gate to more than two inputs   the basic properties of the binary operator such as commutativity and associativity and   the ability of the gate to implement boolean functions alone or in conjunction with other gates of the  functions defined in table   two are equal to constant and four are repeated there are only  functions left to be considered as candidates for logic gates twoinhibition and implicationare not commutative or associative and thus are impractical to use as standard logic gates the other eightcomplement transfer and or nand nor exclusive or and equivalenceare used as standard gates in digital design the graphic symbols and truth tables of the eight gates are shown in fig    each gate has one or two binary input variables designated by and and one binary output variable designated by the and or and inverter circuits were defined in fig    the inverter circuit inverts the logic sense of binary variable producing the not or complement function the small circle in the output of the graphic symbol of an inverter referred to as bubble designates the logic complement the triangle symbol by itself designates buffer circuit buffer produces the transfer function but does not produce logic operation since the binary value of the output is equal to the binary value of the input this circuit is used for power amplification of the signal and is equivalent to two inverters connected in cascade the nand function is the complement of the and function as indicated by graphic symbol that consists of an and graphic symbol followed by small circle the nor function is the complement of the or function and uses an or graphic symbol followed by small circle nand and nor gates are used extensively as standard logic gates and are in fact far more popular than the and and or gates this is because nand and nor gates are easily constructed with transistor circuits and because digital circuits can be easily implemented with them section   digital logic gates  name

on the input side the equivalence or exclusive nor gate is the complement of the exclusive or as indicated by the small circle on the output side of the graphic symbol extension to multiple inputs the gates shown in fig   except for the inverter and buffercan be extended to have more than two inputs gate can be extended to have multiple inputs if the binary operation it represents is commutative and associative the and and or operations defined in boolean algebra possess these two properties for the or function we have    commutative and         associative which indicates that the gate inputs can be interchanged and that the or function can be extended to three or more variables the nand and nor functions are commutative and their gates can be extended to have more than two inputs provided that the definition of the operation is modified slightly the difficulty is that the nand and nor operators are not associative e  t t x y z  as shown in fig   and the following equations  t t        z  xz  yz t t       y   xy  xz to overcome this difficulty we define the multiple nor or nand gate as complemented or or and gate thus by definition we have t t    x y z  xyz the graphic symbols for the three input gates are shown in fig    in writing cascaded nor and nand operations one must use the correct parentheses to signify the proper sequence of the gates to demonstrate this principle consider the circuit of fig    the boolean function for the circuit must be written as   abc de   abc  de the second expression is obtained from one of demorgans theorems it also shows that an expression in sum of products form can be implemented with nand gates  nand and nor gates are discussed further in section    the exclusive or and equivalence gates are both commutative and associative and can be extended to more than two inputs however multiple input exclusive or gates are uncommon from the hardware standpoint in fact even two input function is usually constructed with other types of gates moreover the definition of the function must be modified when extended to more than two variables exclusive or is an odd function e  it is equal to  if the input variables have an

binary signal at the inputs and outputs of any gate has one of two values except during transition one signal value represents logic  and the other logic  since two signal values are assigned to two

signal value value value value     a positive logic negative logic figure   signal assignment and logic polarity signal level to logic value as shown in fig    the higher signal level is designated by and the lower signal level by choosing the high level to represent logic  defines positive logic system choosing the low level to represent logic  defines negative logic system the terms positive and negative are somewhat misleading since both signals may be positive or both may be negative it is not the actual values of the signals that determine the type of logic but rather the assignment of logic values to the relative amplitudes of the two signal levels hardware digital gates are defined in terms of signal values such as and it is up to the user to decide on positive or negative logic polarity consider for example the electronic gate shown in fig     the truth table for this gate is listed in fig     it specifies the physical behavior of the gate when is  and is  the truth table of fig    assumes positive logic assignment with   and   this truth table is the same as the one for the and operation the graphic symbol for positive logic and gate is shown in fig     now consider the negative logic assignment for the same physical gate with   and   the result is the truth table of fig     this table represents the or operation even though the entries are reversed the graphic symbol for the negative logic or gate is shown in fig     the small triangles in the inputs and output section   digital logic gates  xy ll x digital lh hl gate hh y truth table gate block diagram

logic designate polarity indicator the presence of which along terminal signifies that negative logic is assumed for the signal thus the same physical gate can operate either as positive logic and gate or as negative logic or gate the conversion from positive logic to negative logic and vice versa is essentially an operation that changes to and to in both the inputs and the output of gate since this operation produces the dual of function the change of all terminals from one polarity to the other results in taking the dual of the function the upshot is that all and operations are converted to or operations or graphic symbols and vice versa in addition one must not forget to include the polarity indicator triangle in the graphic symbols when negative logic is assumed in this book we will not use negative logic gates and will assume that all gates operate with positive logic assignment   integrated circuits an integrated circuit ic is fabricated on die of silicon semiconductor crystal

gates are interconnected inside the chip to form the required circuit the chip is mounted in ceramic or plastic container and connections are welded to external pins to form the integrated circuit the number of pins may range from  on small ic package to several thousand on larger package each ic has numeric designation printed on the surface of the package for identification vendors provide data books catalogs and internet websites that contain descriptions and information about the ics that they manufacture levels of integration digital ics are often categorized according to the complexity of their circuits as measured by the number of logic gates in single package the differentiation between those chips which have few internal gates and those having hundreds of thousands of gates is made by customary reference to package as being either small  medium  large  or very large scale integration device small scale integration ssi devices contain several independent gates in single package the inputs and outputs of the gates are connected directly to the pins in the package the number of gates is usually fewer than  and is limited by the number of pins available in the ic medium scale integration msi devices have complexity of approximately  to    gates in single package they usually perform specific elementary digital operations msi digital functions are introduced in chapter  as decoders adders and multiplexers and in chapter  as registers and counters large scale integration lsi devices contain thousands of gates in single package they include digital systems such as processors memory chips and programmable logic devices some lsi components are presented in chapter  very large scale integration vlsi devices now contain millions of gates within single package examples are large memory arrays and complex microcomputer chips because of their small size and low cost vlsi devices have revolutionized the computer system design technology giving the designer the capability to create structures that were previously uneconomical to build digital logic families digital integrated circuits are classified not only by their complexity or logical operation but also by the specific circuit technology to which they belong the circuit technology is referred to as digital logic family each logic family has its own basic electronic circuit upon which more complex digital circuits and components are developed the basic circuit in each technology is nand nor or inverter gate the electronic section   integrated circuits  components employed in the construction of the basic circuit are usually used to name the technology many different logic families of digital integrated circuits have been introduced commercially the following are the most popular ttl transistorctransistor logic ecl emitter coupled logic mos metal oxide semiconductor cmos complementary metal oxide semiconductor ttl is logic family that has been in use for  years and is considered to be standard ecl has an advantage in systems requiring high speed operation mos is suitable for circuits that need high component density and cmos is preferable in systems requiring low power consumption such as digital cameras personal media players and other handheld portable devices low power consumption is essential for vlsi design therefore cmos has become the dominant logic family while ttl and ecl continue to decline in use the most important parameters distinguishing logic families are listed below cmos integrated circuits are discussed briefly in the appendix fan out specifies the number of standard loads that the output of typical gate can drive without impairing its normal operation standard load is usually defined as the amount of current needed by an input of another similar gate in the same family fan in is the number of inputs available in gate power dissipation is the power consumed by the gate that must be available from the power supply propagation delay is the average transition delay time for signal to propagate from input to output for example if the input of an inverter switches from  to  the output will switch from  to  but after time determined by the propagation delay of the device the operating speed is inversely proportional to the propagation delay noise margin is the maximum external noise voltage added to an input signal that does not cause an undesirable change in the circuit output computer aided design of vlsi circuits integrated circuits having submicron geometric features are manufactured by optically projecting patterns of light onto silicon wafers prior to exposure the wafers are coated with photoresistive material that either hardens or softens when exposed to light removing extraneous photoresist leaves patterns of exposed silicon the exposed regions are then implanted with dopant atoms to create semiconductor material having the electrical properties of transistors and the logical properties of gates the design process translates functional specification or description of the circuit e  what it must do into physical specification or description how it must be implemented in silicon  the design of digital systems with vlsi circuits containing millions of transistors and gates is an enormous and formidable task systems of this complexity are usually impossible to develop and verify without the assistance of computer aided design cad tools which consist of software programs that support computer based representations of circuits and aid in the development of digital hardware by automating the design process electronic design automation eda covers all phases of the design of integrated circuits typical design flow for creating vlsi circuits consists of sequence of steps beginning with design entry g  entering schematic and culminating with the generation of the database that contains the photomask used to fabricate the ic there are variety of options available for creating the physical realization of digital circuit in silicon the designer can choose between an application specific integrated circuit asic  field programmable gate array fpga  programmable logic device pld  and full custom ic with each of these devices comes set of cad tools that provide the necessary software to facilitate the hardware fabrication of the unit each of these technologies has market niche determined by the size of the market and the unit cost of the devices that are required to implement design some cad systems include an editing program for creating and modifying schematic diagrams on computer screen this process is called schematic capture or schematic entry with the aid of menus keyboard commands and mouse schematic editor can draw circuit diagrams of digital circuits on the computer screen components can be placed on the screen from list in an internal library and can then be connected with lines that represent wires the schematic entry software creates and manages database containing the information produced with the schematic primitive gates and functional blocks have associated models that allow the functionality e  logical behavior and timing of the circuit to be verified verification is performed by applying inputs to the circuit and using logic simulator to determine and display the outputs in text or waveform format an important development in the design of digital systems is the use of hardware description language hdl  such language resembles computer programming language but is specifically oriented to describing digital hardware it represents logic diagrams and other digital information in textual form to describe the functionality and structure of circuit moreover the hdl description of circuits functionality can be abstract without reference to specific hardware thereby freeing designer to devote attention to higher level functional detail g  under certain conditions the circuit must detect particular pattern of and in serial bit stream of data rather than transistor level detail hdl based models of circuit or system are simulated to check and verify its functionality before it is submitted to fabrication thereby reducing the risk and waste of manufacturing circuit that fails to operate correctly in tandem with the emergence of hdl based design languages tools have been developed to automatically and optimally synthesize the logic described by an hdl model of circuit these two advances in technology have led to an almost total reliance by industry on hdl based synthesis tools and methodologies for the design of the circuits of complex digital systems two hdlsverilog and vhdlhave been approved as standards by the institute of electronics and electrical engineers ieee and are in use by design

level minimization is the design task of finding an optimal gate level implementation of the boolean functions describing digital circuit this task is well understood but is difficult to execute by manual methods when the logic has more than few inputs fortunately computer based logic synthesis tools can minimize large set of boolean equations efficiently and quickly nevertheless it is important that designer understand the underlying mathematical description and solution of the problem this chapter serves as foundation for your understanding of that important topic and will enable you to execute manual design of simple circuits preparing you for skilled use of modern design tools the chapter will also introduce hardware description language that is used by modern design tools   the map method the complexity of the digital logic gates that implement boolean function is directly related to the complexity of the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented although the truth table representation of function is unique when it is expressed algebraically it can appear in many different but equivalent forms boolean expressions may be simplified by algebraic means as discussed in section   however this procedure of minimization is awkward because it lacks specific rules to predict each succeeding step in the manipulative process the map method presented here provides simple straightforward procedure for minimizing boolean functions this method may be regarded as pictorial form of truth table the map method is also known as the karnaugh map or map   k map is diagram made up of squares with each square representing one minterm of the function that is to be minimized since any boolean function can be expressed as sum of minterms it follows that boolean function is recognized graphically in the map from the area enclosed by those squares whose minterms are included in the function in fact the map presents visual diagram of all possible ways function may be expressed in standard form by recognizing various patterns the user can derive alternative algebraic expressions for the same function from which the simplest can be selected the simplified expressions produced by the map are always in one of the two standard forms sum of products or product of sums it will be assumed that the simplest algebraic expression is an algebraic expression with minimum number of terms and with the smallest possible number of literals in each term this expression produces circuit diagram with minimum number of gates and the minimum number of inputs to each gate we will see subsequently that the simplest expression is not unique it is sometimes possible to find two or more expressions that satisfy the minimization criteria in that case either solution is satisfactory two variable map the two variable map is shown in fig    there are four minterms for two variables hence the map consists of four squares one for each minterm the map is redrawn in to show the relationship between the squares and the two variables and the  and  marked in each row and column designate the values of variables variable appears primed in row  and unprimed in row  similarly appears primed in column  and unprimed in column  if we mark the squares whose minterms belong to given function the two variable map becomes another useful way to represent any one of the  boolean functions of two variables as an example the function xy is shown in fig    since xy is equal to   is placed inside the square that belongs to  similarly the function  is represented in the map of fig   by three squares marked with these squares are found from the minterms of the function    xy  xy  xy   x  m  m  xy xy m m  xy xy  figure   two variable map section   the map method  y  y y    m m     m x    xy b y figure   representation of functions in the map the three squares could also have been determined from the intersection of variable in the second row and variable in the second column which encloses the area belonging to or in each example the minterms at which the function is asserted are marked with  three variable map three variable map is shown in fig    there are eight minterms for three binary variables therefore the map consists of eight squares note that the minterms are arranged not in binary sequence but in sequence similar to the gray code table    the characteristic of this sequence is that only one bit changes in value from one adjacent column to the next the map drawn in part is marked with numbers in each row and each column to show the relationship between the squares and the three variables for example the square assigned to corresponds to row  and column  when these two numbers are concatenated they give the binary number   whose decimal equivalent is  each cell of the map corresponds to unique minterm so another way of looking at square  xyz is to consider it to be in the row marked and the column belonging to yz column   note that there are four squares in which each variable is equal to  and four in which each is equal to  the variable appears unprimed in the former four yz x       m m m m  xyz xyz xyz xyz m m m m  xyz xyz xyz xyz z figure   three variable map squares and primed in the latter for convenience we write the variable with its letter symbol under the four squares in which it is unprimed to understand the usefulness of the map in simplifying boolean functions we must recognize the basic property possessed by adjacent squares any two adjacent squares in the map differ by only one variable which is primed in one square and unprimed in the other for example and lie in two adjacent squares variable is primed in and unprimed in  whereas the other two variables are the same in both squares from the postulates of boolean algebra it follows that the sum of two minterms in adjacent squares can be simplified to single product term consisting of only two literals to clarify this concept consider the sum of two adjacent squares such as and    xyz  xyz  xz   xz here the two squares differ by the variable which can be removed when the sum of the two minterms is formed thus any two minterms in adjacent squares vertically or horizontally but not diagonally adjacent that are ored together will cause removal of the dissimilar variable the next four examples explain the procedure for minimizing boolean function with k map example   simplify the boolean function x z         first  is marked in each minterm square that represents the function this is shown in fig    in which the squares for minterms        and   are marked with the next step is to find possible adjacent squares these are indicated in the map by two shaded rectangles each enclosing two the upper right rectangle represents the area enclosed by xy this area is determined by observing that the two square area is in row  corresponding to and the last two columns corresponding to similarly the lower left rectangle represents the product term xy  the second row represents and the two left columns represent  the sum of four minterms can be replaced by sum of yz xy       m m    m m   xy figure   map for example   x z          xy  xy section   the map method  only two product terms the logical sum of these two product terms gives the simplified expression  xy  xy in certain cases two squares in the map are considered to be adjacent even though they do not touch each other in fig    is adjacent to and is adjacent to because their minterms differ by one variable this difference can be readily verified algebraically   xyz  xyz  xz   xz   xyz  xyz  xz     xz consequently we must modify the definition of adjacent squares to include this and other similar cases we do so by considering the map as being drawn on surface in which the right and left edges touch each other to form adjacent squares example   simplify the boolean function x z         the map for this function is shown in fig    there are four squares marked with one for each minterm of the function two adjacent squares are combined in the third column to give two literal term yz the remaining two squares with are also adjacent by the new definition these two squares when combined give the two literal term xz the simplified function then becomes  yz  xz yz x       m m yz   m m    xyz xyz note xyz xyz xz figure   map for example   x z          yz  xz consider now any combination of four adjacent squares in the three variable map any such combination represents the logical sum of four minterms and results in an expression with only one literal as an example the logical sum of the four adjacent minterms     and  reduces to the single literal term m     xyz  xyz  xyz  xyz  xz   xz   xz  xz  x   the number of adjacent squares that may be combined must always represent number that is power of two such as     and  as more adjacent squares are combined we obtain product term with fewer literals one square represents one minterm giving term with three literals two adjacent squares represent term with two literals four adjacent squares represent term with one literal eight adjacent squares encompass the entire map and produce function that is always equal to  example   simplify the boolean function x z          the map for is shown in fig    first we combine the four adjacent squares in the first and last columns to give the single literal term the remaining single square representing minterm  is combined with an adjacent square that has already been used once this is not only permissible but rather desirable because the two adjacent squares give the two literal term xy and the single square represents the three literal minterm xyz the simplified function is   xy yz yz m     yz      m m    xy note yz yz figure   map for example   x z            xy section   the map method  if function is not expressed in sum of minterms form it is possible to use the map to obtain the minterms of the function and then simplify the function to an expression with minimum number of terms it is necessary however to make sure that the algebraic expression is in sum of products form each product term can be plotted in the map in one two or more squares the minterms of the function are then read directly from the map example   for the boolean function  ac  ab  abc  bc express this function as sum of minterms  find the minimal sum of products expression note that is sum of products three product terms in the expression have two literals and are represented in three variable map by two squares each the two squares corresponding to the first term ac are found in fig   from the coincidence of first row and two middle columns to give squares   and   note that in marking in the squares it is possible to find  already placed there from preceding term this happens with the second term ab which has in squares   and   square   is common with the first term ac though so only one  is marked in it continuing in this fashion we determine that the term abc belongs in square   corresponding to minterm  and the term bc has two in squares   and   the function has total of five minterms as indicated by the five in the map of fig    the minterms are read directly from the map to be       and  the function can be expressed in sum of minterms form as a c           the sum of products expression as originally given has too many terms it can be simplified as shown in the map to an expression with only two terms   ab bc     ab  m m     m m   c figure   map of example   ac ab abc bc ab   four variable map the map for boolean functions of four binary variables x z is shown in fig    in fig   are listed the  minterms and the squares assigned to each in fig    the map is redrawn to show the relationship between the squares and the four variables the rows and columns are numbered in gray code sequence with only one digit changing value between two adjacent rows or columns the minterm corresponding to each square can be obtained from the concatenation of the row number with the column number for example the numbers of the third row   and the second column    when concatenated give the binary number    the binary equivalent of decimal   thus the square in the third row and second column represents minterm  the map minimization of four variable boolean functions is similar to the method used to minimize three variable functions adjacent squares are defined to be squares next to each other in addition the map is considered to lie on surface with the top and bottom edges as well as the right and left edges touching each other to form adjacent squares for example and form adjacent squares as do and  the combination of adjacent squares that is useful during the simplification process is easily determined from inspection of the four variable map one square represents one minterm giving term with four literals two adjacent squares represent term with three literals four adjacent squares represent term with two literals eight adjacent squares represent term with one literal sixteen adjacent squares produce function that is always equal to  no other combination of squares can simplify the function the next two examples show the procedure used to simplify four variable boolean functions yz wx       m m m m   wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz m m m m   wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz m          wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz m m   m    wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz a  figure   four variable map section   four variable map  example   simplify the boolean function w y                     since the function has four variables four variable map must be used the minterms listed in the sum are marked by in the map of fig    eight adjacent squares marked with can be combined to form the one literal term the remaining three on the right cannot be combined to give simplified term they must be combined as two or four adjacent squares the larger the number of squares combined the smaller is the number of literals in the term in this example the top two on the right are combined with the top two on the left to give the term wz note that it is permissible to use the same square more than once we are now left with square marked by  in the third row and fourth column square    instead of taking this square alone which will give term with four literals  we combine it with squares already used to form an area of four adjacent squares these squares make up the two middle rows and the two end columns giving the term xz the simplified function is   wz  xz yz wx       wyz m m      m m wyz     xyz         xyz m   m     z note wyz wyz wz xyz xyz xz figure   map for example   w y                   wz xz example   simplify the boolean function  abc  bcd  abcd  abc the area in the map covered by this function consists of the squares marked with in fig    the function has four variables and as expressed consists of three terms with abc cd abcd ab       m m abcd     m m    acd m      m m       abcd abcd abc note abcd abcd abd abcd abcd abd abd abd bd abc abc bc figure   map for example   abc bcd abcd abc bd bc acd three literals each and one term with four literals each term with three literals is represented in the map by two squares for example abc is represented in squares   and    the function can be simplified in the map by taking the in the four corners to give the term bd this is possible because these four squares are adjacent when the map is drawn in surface with top and bottom edges as well as left and right edges touching one another the two left hand in the top row are combined with the two in the bottom row to give the term bc the remaining  may be combined in twosquare area to give the term acd the simplified function is  bd  bc  acd prime implicants in choosing adjacent squares in map we must ensure that   all the minterms of the function are covered when we combine the squares   the number of terms in the expression is minimized and   there are no redundant terms e  minterms already covered by other terms  sometimes there may be two or more expressions that satisfy the simplification criteria the procedure for combining squares in the map may be made more systematic if we understand the meaning of two special types of terms prime implicant is product term obtained by combining the maximum possible number of adjacent squares in the map if minterm in square is covered by only one prime implicant that prime implicant is said to be essential section   four variable map  the prime implicants of function can be obtained from the map by combining all possible maximum numbers of squares this means that single  on map represents prime implicant if it is not adjacent to any other two adjacent form prime implicant provided that they are not within group of four adjacent squares four adjacent form prime implicant if they are not within group of eight adjacent squares and so on the essential prime implicants are found by looking at each square marked with  and checking the number of prime implicants that cover it the prime implicant is essential if it is the only prime implicant that covers the minterm consider the following four variable boolean function a c                     the minterms of the function are marked with in the maps of fig    the partial map fig     shows two essential prime implicants each formed by collapsing four cells into term having only two literals one term is essential because there is only one way to include minterm within four adjacent squares these four squares define the term bd similarly there is only one way that minterm can be combined with four adjacent squares and this gives the second term bd the two essential prime implicants cover eight minterms the three minterms that were omitted from the partial map   and  must be considered next figure   shows all possible ways that the three minterms can be covered with prime implicants minterm can be covered with either prime implicant cd or prime implicant bc minterm can be covered with either ad or ab minterm  is covered with any one of the four prime implicants the simplified expression is obtained from the logical sum of the two essential prime implicants and any two prime implicants cd ab cd       ab       m m abcd m m         abcd m m cd  m ad bd        m      bc           m m   m            abcd abcd d ab note abcd abcd abd abcd abcd abd abd abd bd essential prime implicants prime implicants cd bc bd and bd ad and ab figure   simplification using prime implicants that cover minterms   and  there are four possible ways that the function can be expressed with four product terms of two literals each  bd  bd  cd  ad  bd  bd  cd  ab  bd  bd  bc  ad  bd  bd  bc  ab the previous example has demonstrated that the identification of the prime implicants in the map helps in determining the alternatives that are available for obtaining simplified expression the procedure for finding the simplified expression from the map requires that we first determine all the essential prime implicants the simplified expression is obtained from the logical sum of all the essential prime implicants plus other prime implicants that may be needed to cover any remaining minterms not covered by the essential prime implicants occasionally there may be more than one way of combining squares and each combination may produce an equally simplified expression five variable map maps for more than four variables are not as simple to use as maps for four or fewer variables five variable map needs  squares and six variable map needs  squares when the number of variables becomes large the number of squares becomes excessive and the geometry for combining adjacent squares becomes more involved maps for more than four variables are difficult to use and will not be considered here   product of sums simplification the minimized boolean functions derived from the map in all previous examples were expressed in sum of products form with minor modification the product of sums form can be obtained the procedure for obtaining minimized function in product of sums form follows from the basic properties of boolean functions the placed in the squares of the map represent the minterms of the function the minterms not included in the standard sum of products form of function denote the complement of the function from this observation we see that the complement of function is represented in the map by the squares not marked by if we mark the empty squares by and combine them into valid adjacent squares we obtain simplified sum of products expression of the complement of the function e  of  the complement of gives us back the function in product of sums form consequence of demorgans theorem  because of the generalized demorgans theorem the function so obtained is automatically in product of sums form the best way to show this is by example section   product of sums simplification  example   simplify the following boolean function into sum of products form and product of sums form a c              the marked in the map of fig    represent all the minterms of the function the squares marked with represent the minterms not included in and therefore denote the complement of combining the squares with gives the simplified function in sum of products form  f  bd  bc  acd if the squares marked with are combined as shown in the diagram we obtain the simplified complemented function  ab  cd  bd applying demorgans theorem by taking the dual and complementing each literal as described in section    we obtain the simplified function in productof sums form  f       the gate level implementation of the simplified expressions obtained in example   is shown in fig    the sum of products expression is implemented in with group of and gates one for each and term the outputs of the and gates are connected to the inputs of single or gate the same function is implemented in in its product

connected to the inputs of single and gate in each case it is assumed that the input variables are directly available in their complement so inverters are not needed the configuration pattern established in fig    is the general form by which any boolean function is implemented when expressed in one of the standard forms and gates are connected to single or gate when in sum of products form or gates are connected to single and gate when in product of sums form either configuration forms two levels of gates thus the implementation of function in standard form is said to be two level implementation the two level implementation may not be practical depending on the number of inputs to the gates example   showed the procedure for obtaining the product of sums simplification when the function is originally expressed in the sum of minterms canonical form the procedure is also valid when the function is originally expressed in the productof maxterms canonical form consider for example the truth table that defines the function in table   in sum of minterms form this function is expressed as x z         section   product of sums simplification  yz x       m m xz     m m     xz figure   map for the function of table   in product of maxterms form it is expressed as x z         in other words the of the function represent the minterms and the represent the maxterms the map for this function is shown in fig    one can start simplifying the function by first marking the for each minterm that the function is  the remaining squares are marked by if instead the product of maxterms is initially given one can start marking in those squares listed in the function the remaining squares are then marked by once the and are marked the function can be simplified in either one of the standard forms for the sum of products we combine the to obtain  xz  xz for the product of sums we combine the to obtain the simplified complemented function  xz  xz which shows that the exclusive or function is the complement of the equivalence function section    taking the complement of we obtain the simplified function in product of sums form   x  to enter function expressed in product of sums form into the map use the complement of the function to find the squares that are to be marked by for example the function    b  can be entered into the map by first taking its complement namely  abc  bd and then marking in the squares representing the minterms of the remaining squares are marked with   dont care conditions the logical sum of the minterms associated with boolean function specifies the conditions under which the function is equal to  the function is equal to  for the rest of the minterms this pair of conditions assumes that all the combinations of the values for the variables of the function are valid in practice in some applications the function is not specified for certain combinations of the variables as an example the four bit binary code for the decimal digits has six combinations that are not used and consequently are considered to be unspecified functions that have unspecified outputs for some input combinations are called incompletely specified functions in most applications we simply dont care what value is assumed by the function for the unspecified minterms for this reason it is customary to call the unspecified minterms of function dont care conditions these dont care conditions can be used on map to provide further simplification of the boolean expression dont care minterm is combination of variables whose logical value is not specified such minterm cannot be marked with  in the map because it would require that the function always be  for such combination likewise putting  on the square requires the function to be  to distinguish the dont care condition from and an is used thus an inside square in the map indicates that we dont care whether the value of  or  is assigned to for the particular minterm in choosing adjacent squares to simplify the function in map the dont care minterms may be assumed to be either  or  when simplifying the function we can choose to include each dont care minterm with either the or the depending on which combination gives the simplest expression example   simplify the boolean function w y           which has the dont care conditions w y       the minterms of are the variable combinations that make the function equal to  the minterms of are the dont care minterms that may be assigned either  or  the map simplification is shown in fig    the minterms of are marked by those of are marked by xs and the remaining squares are filled with to get the simplified expression in sum of products form we must include all five in the map but we may or may not include any of the xs depending on the way the function is simplified the term yz covers the four minterms in the third column the remaining minterm  can be combined section   dont care conditions  yz yz wx       wx       m m m m        wx wz m m m x          m  m                   m m   m m              z yz yz f yz wx f yz wz figure   example with dont care conditions with minterm to give the three literal term wxz however by including one or two adjacent xs we can combine four adjacent squares to give two literal term in fig     dont care minterms  and  are included with the resulting in the simplified function  yz  wx in fig     dont care minterm  is included with the and the simplified function is now  yz  wz either one of the preceding two expressions satisfies the conditions stated for this example the previous example has shown that the dont care minterms in the map are initially marked with xs and are considered as being either  or  the choice between  and  is made depending on the way the incompletely specified function is simplified once the choice is made the simplified function obtained will consist of sum of minterms that includes those minterms which were initially unspecified and have been chosen to be included with the consider the two simplified expressions obtained in example   w y  yz  wx              w y  yz  wz            both expressions include minterms       and  that make the function equal to  the dont care minterms    and  are treated differently in each expression the first expression includes minterms  and  with the and leaves minterm  with the the second expression includes minterm  with the and leaves minterms  and  with the the two expressions represent two functions that are not algebraically equal both cover the specified minterms of the function but each covers different dont care minterms as far as the incompletely specified function is concerned either expression is acceptable because the only difference is in the value of for the dont care minterms it is also possible to obtain simplified product of sums expression for the function of fig    in this case the only way to combine the is to include dont care minterms  and  with the to give simplified complemented function   wy taking the complement of gives the simplified expression in product of sums form w y  w              in this case we include minterms  and  with the and minterm  with the   nand and nor implementation digital circuits are frequently constructed with nand or nor gates rather than with and and or gates nand and nor gates are easier to fabricate with electronic components and are the basic gates used in all ic digital logic families because of the prominence of nand and nor gates in the design of digital circuits rules and procedures have been developed for the conversion from boolean functions given in terms of and or and not into equivalent nand and nor logic diagrams nand circuits the nand gate is said to be universal gate because any logic circuit can be implemented with it to show that any boolean function can be implemented with nand gates we need only show that the logical operations of and or and complement can be obtained with nand gates alone this is indeed shown in fig    the complement operation is obtained from one input nand gate that behaves exactly like an inverter the and operation requires two nand gates the first produces the nand operation and the second inverts the logical sense of the signal the or operation is achieved through nand gate with additional inverters in each input convenient way to implement boolean function with nand gates is to obtain the simplified boolean function in terms of boolean operators and then convert the function to nand logic the conversion of an algebraic expression from and or and complement to nand can be done by simple circuit manipulation techniques that change andcor diagrams to nand diagrams to facilitate the conversion to nand logic it is convenient to define an alternative graphic symbol for the gate two equivalent graphic symbols for the nand gate are shown in fig    the and invert symbol has been defined previously and consists section   nand and nor implementation  inverter x xy and x xy y or figure   logic operations with nand gates xyz x z xyz y z and invert invert or figure   two graphic symbols for three input nand gate of an and graphic symbol followed by small circle negation indicator referred to as bubble alternatively it is possible to represent nand gate by an or graphic symbol that is preceded by bubble in each input the invert or symbol for the nand gate follows demorgans theorem and the convention that the negation indicator bubble denotes complementation the two graphic symbols representations are useful in the analysis and design of nand circuits when both symbols are mixed in the same diagram the circuit is said to be in mixed notation two level implementation the implementation of boolean functions with nand gates requires that the functions be in sum of products form to see the relationship between sum of products expression and its equivalent nand implementation consider the logic diagrams drawn in fig    all three diagrams are equivalent and implement the function  ab  cd the function is implemented in fig    with and and or gates in fig     the and gates are replaced by nand gates and the or gate is replaced by nand gate with an or invert graphic symbol remember that bubble denotes complementation and two bubbles along the same line represent double complementation so both can be removed removing the bubbles on the gates of produces the circuit of  therefore the two diagrams implement the same function and are equivalent b c a a b f c d  figure   three ways to implement  ab  cd in fig     the output nand gate is redrawn with the and invert graphic symbol in drawing nand logic diagrams the circuit shown in either fig    or is acceptable the one in fig    is in mixed notation and represents more direct relationship to the boolean expression it implements the nand implementation in fig    can be verified algebraically the function it implements can easily be converted to sum ofproducts form by demorgans theorem   ab cd   ab  cd example   implement the following boolean function with nand gates x z            the first step is to simplify the function into sum of products form this is done by means of the map of fig     from which the simplified function is obtained  xy  xy  the two level nand implementation is shown in fig    in mixed notation note that input must have one input nand gate an inverter to compensate for the bubble in the second level gate an alternative way of drawing the logic diagram is given in fig     here all the nand gates are drawn with the same graphic symbol the inverter with input has been removed but the input variable is complemented and denoted by section   nand and nor implementation  yz       m m      xy xy xy m m x    xy z x y x y y z c  figure   solution to example   the procedure described in the previous example indicates that boolean function can be implemented with two levels of nand gates the procedure for obtaining the logic diagram from boolean function is as follows   simplify the function and express it in sum of products form   draw nand gate for each product term of the expression that has at least two literals the inputs to each nand gate are the literals of the term this procedure produces group of first level gates   draw single gate using the and invert or the invert or graphic symbol in the second level with inputs coming from outputs of first level gates   term with single literal requires an inverter in the first level however if the single literal is complemented it can be connected directly to an input of the secondlevel nand gate multilevel nand circuits the standard form of expressing boolean functions results in two level implementation there are occasions however when the design of digital systems results in gating structures with three or more levels the most common procedure in the design of multilevel circuits is to express the boolean function in terms of and or and complement operations the function can then be implemented with and and or gates after that if necessary it can be converted into an all nand circuit consider for example the boolean function  cd   bc d a b a andcor gates d a b b nand gates figure   implementing  cd   bc although it is possible to remove the parentheses and reduce the expression into standard sum of products form we choose to implement it as multilevel circuit for illustration the andcor implementation is shown in fig     there are four levels of gating in the circuit the first level has two and gates the second level has an or gate followed by an and gate in the third level and an or gate in the fourth level logic diagram with pattern of alternating levels of and and or gates can easily be converted into nand circuit with the use of mixed notation shown in fig    the procedure is to change every and gate to an and invert graphic symbol and every or gate to an invert or graphic symbol the nand circuit performs the same logic as the andcor diagram as long as there are two bubbles along the same line the bubble associated with input causes an extra complementation which must be compensated for by changing the input literal to the general procedure for converting multilevel andcor diagram into an all nand diagram using mixed notation is as follows   convert all and gates to nand gates with and invert graphic symbols   convert all or gates to nand gates with invert or graphic symbols   check all the bubbles in the diagram for every bubble that is not compensated by another small circle along the same line insert an inverter one input nand gate or complement the input literal as another example consider the multilevel boolean function  ab  ab  section   nand and nor implementation  b b c a andcor gates b b c b nand gates figure   implementing  ab  ab   the andcor implementation of this function is shown in fig    with three levels of gating the conversion to nand with mixed notation is presented in fig    of the diagram the two additional bubbles associated with inputs and cause these two literals to be complemented to and the bubble in the output nand gate complements the output value so we need to insert an inverter gate at the output in order to complement the signal again and get the original value back nor implementation the nor operation is the dual of the nand operation therefore all procedures and rules for nor logic are the duals of the corresponding procedures and rules developed for nand logic the nor gate is another universal gate that can be used to implement any boolean function the implementation of the complement or and and operations with nor gates is shown in fig    the complement operation is obtained from oneinput nor gate that behaves exactly like an inverter the or operation requires two nor gates and the and operation is obtained with nor gate that has inverters in each input the two graphic symbols for the mixed notation are shown in fig    the or invert symbol defines the nor operation as an or followed by complement the invert and symbol complements each input and then performs an and operation the two symbols designate the same nor operation and are logically identical because of demorgans theorem inverter x xy or x y xy and figure   logic operations with nor gates x z xyz y y z a or invert invert and figure   two graphic symbols for the nor gate two level implementation with nor gates requires that the function be simplified into product of sums form remember that the simplified product of sums expression is obtained from the map by combining the and complementing product of sums expression is implemented with first level of or gates that produce the sum terms followed by second level and gate to produce the product the transformation from the orcand diagram to nor diagram is achieved by changing the or gates to nor gates with or invert graphic symbols and the and gate to nor gate with an invert and graphic symbol single literal term going into the second level gate must be complemented figure   shows the nor implementation of function expressed as product of sums   c  e the orcand pattern can easily be detected by the removal of the bubbles along the same line variable is complemented to compensate for the third bubble at the input of the second level gate the procedure for converting multilevel andcor diagram to an all nor diagram is similar to the one presented for nand gates for the nor case we must convert each or gate to an or invert symbol and each and gate to an invert and symbol any bubble that is not compensated by another bubble along the same line needs an inverter or the complementation of the input literal the transformation of the andcor diagram of fig    into nor diagram is shown in fig    the boolean function for this circuit is  ab  ab  section   other two level implementations  b f e figure   implementing   c  e b a c figure   implementing  ab  ab  with nor gates the equivalent andcor diagram can be recognized from the nor diagram by removing all the bubbles to compensate for the bubbles in four inputs it is necessary to complement the corresponding input literals   other two level implementations the types of gates most often found in integrated circuits are nand and nor gates for this reason nand and nor logic implementations are the most important from practical point of view some but not all nand or nor gates allow the possibility of wire connection between the outputs of two gates to provide specific logic function this type of logic is called wired logic for example open collector ttl nand gates when tied together perform wired and logic the wired and logic performed with two nand gates is depicted in fig     the and gate is drawn with the lines going through the center of the gate to distinguish it from conventional gate the wired and gate is not physical gate but only symbol to designate the function obtained from the indicated wired connection the logic function implemented by the circuit of fig    is  ab cd   ab  cd    c  and is called an andcorcinvert function a b ab cd  b  d  c d wired and in open collector wired or in ecl gates ttl nand gates  andcorcinvert  orcandcinvert figure   wired logic wired and logic with two nand gates wired or in emitter coupled logic ecl gates similarly the nor outputs of ecl gates can be tied together to perform wired or function the logic function implemented by the circuit of fig    is         c   and is called an orcandcinvert function wired logic gate does not produce physical second level gate since it is just wire connection nevertheless for discussion purposes we will consider the circuits of fig    as two level implementations the first level consists of nand or nor gates and the second level has single and or or gate the wired connection in the graphic symbol will be omitted in subsequent discussions nondegenerate forms it will be instructive from theoretical point of view to find out how many two level combinations of gates are possible we consider four types of gates and or nand and nor if we assign one type of gate for the first level and one type for the second level we find that there are  possible combinations of two level forms  the same type of gate can be in the first and second levels as in nandcnand implementation  eight of these combinations are said to be degenerate forms because they degenerate to single operation this can be seen from circuit with and gates in the first level and an and gate in the second level the output of the circuit is merely the and function of all input variables the remaining eight nondegenerate forms produce an implementation in sum of products form or product of sums form the eight nondegenerate forms are as follows andcor orcand nandcnand norcnor norcor nandcand orcnand andcnor section   other two level implementations  the first gate listed in each of the forms constitutes first level in the implementation the second gate listed is single gate placed in the second level note that any two forms listed on the same line are duals of each other the andcor and orcand forms are the basic two level forms discussed in section   the nandcnand and norcnor forms were presented in section   the remaining four forms are investigated in this section andcorcinvert implementation the two forms nandcand and andcnor are equivalent and can be treated together both perform the andcorcinvert function as shown in fig    the andcnor form resembles the andcor form but with an inversion done by the bubble in the output of the nor gate it implements the function  ab  cd  by using the alternative graphic symbol for the nor gate we obtain the diagram of fig     note that the single variable is not complemented because the only change made is in the graphic symbol of the nor gate now we move the bubble from the input terminal of the second level gate to the output terminals of the first level gates an inverter is needed for the single variable in order to compensate for the bubble alternatively the inverter can be removed provided that input is complemented the circuit of fig    is nandcand form and was shown in fig    to implement the andcorcinvert function an andcor implementation requires an expression in sum of products form the andcorcinvert implementation is similar except for the inversion therefore if the complement of the function is simplified into sum of products form by combining the in the map  it will be possible to implement with the andcor part of the function when passes through the always present output inversion the invert part  it will a b b c f f f e e andcnor andcnor nandcand figure   andcorcinvert circuits  ab  cd   generate the output of the function an example for the andcorcinvert implementation will be shown subsequently orcandcinvert implementation the orcnand and norcor forms perform the orcandcinvert function as shown in fig    the orcnand form resembles the orcand form except for the inversion done by the bubble in the nand gate it implements the function    c  e by using the alternative graphic symbol for the nand gate we obtain the diagram of fig    the circuit in fig    is obtained by moving the small circles from the inputs of the second level gate to the outputs of the first level gates the circuit of fig    is norcor form and was shown in fig    to implement the orcandc invert function the orcandcinvert implementation requires an expression in product of sums form if the complement of the function is simplified into that form we can implement with the orcand part of the function when passes through the invert part we obtain the complement of or in the output tabular summary and example table   summarizes the procedures for implementing boolean function in any one of the four  level forms because of the invert part in each case it is convenient to use the simplification of the complement of the function when is implemented in one of these forms we obtain the complement of the function in the andcor or orcand form the four  level

shown in fig       section   exclusive or function   exclusive or function the exclusive or xor  denoted by the symbol  is logical operation that performs the following boolean operation   xy  xy the exclusive or is equal to  if only is equal to  or if only is equal to  e  and differ in value  but not when both are equal to  or when both are equal to  the exclusivenor also known as equivalence

exclusive or by means of truth table or by algebraic manipulation     xy  xy    x   xy  xy the following identities apply to the exclusive or operation   x    x           any of these identities can be proven with truth table or by replacing the  operation by its equivalent boolean expression also it can be shown that the exclusive or operation is both commutative and associative that is b  a and         this means that the two inputs to an exclusive or gate can be interchanged without affecting the operation it also means that we can evaluate three variable exclusive or operation in any order and for this reason three or more variables can be expressed without parentheses this would imply the possibility of using exclusive or gates with three or more inputs however multiple input exclusive or gates are difficult to fabricate with hardware in fact even two input function is usually constructed with other types of gates two input exclusive or function is constructed with conventional gates using two inverters two and gates and an or gate as shown in fig     figure   shows the implementation of the exclusive or with four nand gates the first nand gate performs the operation xy

implementations only limited number of boolean functions can be expressed in terms of exclusive or operations nevertheless this function emerges quite often during the design of digital systems it is particularly useful in arithmetic operations and error detection and correction circuits odd function the exclusive or operation with three or more variables can be converted into an ordinary boolean function by replacing the  symbol with its equivalent boolean expression in particular the three variable case can be converted to boolean expression as follows    ab  ab  ab  ab  abc  abc  abc  abc        the boolean expression clearly indicates that the three variable exclusive or function is equal to  if only one variable is equal to  or if all three variables are equal to  contrary to the two variable case in which only one variable must be equal to  in the case of three or more variables the requirement is that an odd number of variables be equal to  as consequence the multiple variable exclusive or operation is defined as an odd function section   exclusive or function   the boolean function derived from the three variable exclusive or operation is expressed as the logical sum of four minterms whose binary numerical values are        and   each of these binary numbers has an odd number of the remaining four minterms not included in the function are        and   and they have an even number of in their binary numerical values in general an variable exclusive or function is an odd function defined as the logical sum of the  minterms whose binary numerical values have an odd number of the definition of an odd function can be clarified by plotting it in map figure   shows the map for the three variable exclusive or function the four minterms of the function are unit distance apart from each other the odd function is identified from the four minterms whose binary values have an odd number of the complement of an odd function is an even function as shown in fig     the three variable even function is equal to  when an even number of its variables is equal to  including the condition that none of the variables is equal to   the three input odd function is implemented by means of two input exclusive or gates as shown in fig    the complement of an odd function is obtained by replacing the output gate with an exclusive nor gate as shown in fig     consider now the four variable exclusive or operation by algebraic manipulation we can obtain the sum of minterms for this function     ab  ab   cd  cd   ab  ab cd  cd   ab  ab cd  cd

figure   map for four variable exclusive or function there are  minterms for four variable boolean function half of the minterms have binary numerical values with an odd number of the other half of the minterms have binary numerical values with an even number of in plotting the function in the map the binary numerical value for minterm is determined from the row and column numbers of the square that represents the minterm the map of fig    is plot of the four variable exclusive or function this is an odd function because the binary values of all the minterms have an odd number of the complement of an odd function is an even function as shown in fig     the four variable even function is equal to  when an even number of its variables is equal to  parity generation and checking exclusive or functions are very useful in systems requiring error detection and correction codes as discussed in section   parity bit is used for the purpose of detecting errors during the transmission of binary information parity bit is an extra bit included with binary message to make the number of either odd or even the message including the parity bit is transmitted and then checked at the receiving end for errors an error is detected if the checked parity does not correspond with the one transmitted the circuit that generates the parity bit in the transmitter is called parity generator the circuit that checks the parity in the receiver is called parity checker as an example consider three bit message to be transmitted together with an even parity bit table   shows the truth table for the parity generator the three bitsx and zconstitute the message and are the inputs to the circuit the parity bit is the output for even parity the bit must be generated to make the total number of including even from the truth table we see that constitutes an section   exclusive or function   table   even parity generator truth table three bit message parity bit y p

numerical values have an odd number of therefore can be expressed as three variable exclusive or function  y the logic diagram for the parity generator is shown in fig     the three bits in the message together with the parity bit are transmitted to their destination where they are applied to parity checker circuit to check for possible errors in the transmission since the information was transmitted with even parity the four bits received must have an even number of an error occurs during the transmission if the four bits received have an odd number of indicating that one bit has changed in value during transmission the output of the parity checker denoted by will be equal to  if an error occursthat is if the four bits received have an odd number of table   is the truth table for the even parity checker from it we see that the function consists of the eight minterms with binary numerical values having an odd number of the table corresponds to the map of fig     which table

checker can be implemented with exclusiveor gates  y p the logic diagram of the parity checker is shown in fig     it is worth noting that the parity generator can be implemented with the circuit of fig    if the input is connected to logic  and the output is marked with this is because    causing the value of to pass through the gate unchanged the advantage of this strategy is that the same circuit can be used for both parity generation and checking it is obvious from the foregoing example that parity generation and checking circuits always have an output function that includes half of the minterms whose numerical values have either an odd or even number of as consequence they can be implemented with exclusive or gates function with an even number of is the complement of an odd function it is implemented with exclusive or gates except that the gate associated with the output must be an exclusive nor to provide the required complementation   hardware description language manual methods for designing logic circuits are feasible only when the circuit is small for anything else e  practical circuit  designers use computer based design tools coupled with the correct by construction methodology computer based design tools section   hardware description language   leverage the creativity and the effort of designer and reduce the risk of producing flawed design prototype integrated circuits are too expensive and time consuming to build so all modern design tools rely on hardware description language to describe design and test circuit in software before it is ever manufactured hardware description language hdl is computer based language that describes the hardware of digital systems in textual form it resembles an ordinary computer programming language such as but is specifically oriented to describing hardware structures and the behavior of logic circuits it can be used to represent logic diagrams truth tables boolean expressions and complex abstractions of the behavior of digital system one way to view an hdl is to observe that it describes relationship between signals that are the inputs to circuit and the signals that are the outputs of the circuit for example an hdl description of an and gate describes how the logic value of the gates output is determined by the logic values of its inputs as documentation language an hdl is used to represent and document digital systems in form that can be read by both humans and computers and is suitable as an exchange language between designers the language content can be stored retrieved edited and transmitted easily and processed by computer software in an efficient manner hdls are used in several major steps in the design flow of an integrated circuit design entry functional simulation or verification logic synthesis timing verification and fault simulation design entry creates an hdl based description of the functionality that is to be implemented in hardware depending on the hdl the description can be in variety of forms boolean logic equations truth tables netlist of interconnected gates or an abstract behavioral model the hdl model may also represent partition of larger circuit into smaller interconnected and interacting functional units logic simulation displays the behavior of digital system through the use of computer simulator interprets the hdl description and either produces readable output such as time ordered sequence of input and output signal values or displays waveforms of the signals the simulation of circuit predicts how the hardware will behave before it is actually fabricated simulation detects functional errors in design without having to physically create and operate the circuit errors that are detected during simulation can be corrected by modifying the appropriate hdl statements the stimulus e  the logic values of the inputs to circuit that tests the functionality of the design is called test bench thus to simulate digital system the design is first described in an hdl and then verified by simulating the design and checking it with test bench which is also written in the hdl an alternative and more complex approach relies on formal mathematical methods to prove that circuit is functionally correct we will focus exclusively on simulation logic synthesis is the process of deriving list of physical components and their interconnections called netlist from the model of digital system described in an hdl the netlist can be used to fabricate an integrated circuit or to lay out printed circuit board with the hardware counterparts of the gates in the list logic synthesis is similar to compiling program in conventional high level language the difference is that instead of producing an object code logic synthesis produces database describing the elements and structure of circuit the database specifies how to fabricate physical integrated circuit that implements in silicon the functionality described by statements made in an hdl logic synthesis is based on formal exact procedures that implement digital circuits and addresses that part of digital design which can be automated with computer software the design of todays large complex circuits is made possible by logic synthesis software timing verification confirms that the fabricated integrated circuit will operate at specified speed because each logic gate in circuit has propagation delay signal transition at the input of circuit cannot immediately cause change in the logic value of the output of circuit propagation delays ultimately limit the speed at which circuit can operate timing verification checks each signal path to verify that it is not compromised by propagation delay this step is done after logic synthesis specifies the actual devices that will compose circuit and before the circuit is released for production in vlsi circuit design fault simulation compares the behavior of an ideal circuit with the behavior of circuit that contains process induced flaw dust and other particulates in the atmosphere of the clean room can cause circuit to be fabricated with fault circuit with fault will not exhibit the same functionality as fault free circuit fault simulation is used to identify input stimuli that can be used to reveal the difference between the faulty circuit and the fault free circuit these test patterns will be used to test fabricated devices to ensure that only good devices are shipped to the customer test generation and fault simulation may occur at different steps in the design process but they are always done before production in order to avoid the disaster of producing circuit whose internal logic cannot be tested companies that design integrated circuits use proprietary and public hdls in the public domain there are two standard hdls that are supported by the ieee vhdl and verilog vhdl is department of defensecmandated language  the in vhdl stands for the first letter in vhsic an acronym for very high speed integrated circuit  verilog began as proprietary hdl of cadence design systems but cadence transferred control of verilog to consortium of companies and universities known as open verilog international ovi as step leading to its adoption as an ieee standard vhdl is more difficult to learn than verilog because verilog is an easier language than vhdl to describe learn and use we have chosen it for this book however the verilog hdl descriptions listed throughout the book are not just about verilog but also serve to introduce design methodology based on the concept of computer aided modeling of digital systems by means of typical hardware description language our emphasis will be on the modeling verification and synthesis both manual and automated of verilog models of circuits having specified behavior the verilog hdl was initially approved as standard hdl in    revised and enhanced versions of the language were approved in   and    we will address only those features of verilog including the latest standard that support our discussion of hdl based design methodology for integrated circuits section   hardware description language   module declaration the language reference manual for the verilog hdl presents syntax that describes precisely the constructs that can be used in the language in particular verilog model is composed of text using keywords of which there are about   keywords are predefined lowercase identifiers that define the language constructs examples of keywords are module endmodule input output wire and or and not for clarity keywords will be displayed in boldface in the text in all examples of code and wherever it is appropriate to call attention to their use any text between two forward slashes    and the end of the line is interpreted as comment and will have no effect on simulation using the model multiline comments begin with  and terminate with   blank spaces are ignored but they may not appear within the text of keyword user specified identifier an operator or the representation of number verilog is case sensitive which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are distinguishable g  not is not the same as not  the term module refers to the text enclosed by the keyword pair module    endmodule module is the fundamental descriptive unit in the verilog language it is declared by the keyword module and must always be terminated by the keyword endmodule combinational logic can be described by schematic connection of gates by set of boolean equations or by truth table each type of description can be developed in verilog we will demonstrate each style beginning with simple example of verilog gate level description to illustrate some aspects of the language the hdl description of the circuit of fig    is shown in hdl example   the first line of text is comment optional providing useful information to the reader the second line begins with the keyword module and starts the declaration description of the module the last line completes the declaration with the keyword endmodule the keyword module is followed by name and list of ports the name simple circuit in this example is an identifier identifiers are names given to modules variables g  signal  and other elements of the language so that they can be referenced in the design in general we choose meaningful names for modules identifiers are composed of alphanumeric characters and the underscore   and are case sensitive identifiers must start with an alphabetic character or an underscore but they cannot start with number w g b g figure   circuit to demonstrate an hdl hdl example   combinational logic modeled with primitives   verilog model of circuit of figure    ieee     syntax module simple circuit b d  output e input b wire  and   b   optional gate instance name not  c  or  w   endmodule the port list of module is the interface between the module and its environment in this example the ports are the inputs and outputs of the circuit the logic values of the inputs to circuit are determined by the environment the logic values of the outputs are determined within the circuit and result from the action of the inputs on the circuit the port list is enclosed in parentheses and commas are used to separate elements of the list the statement is terminated with semicolon   in our examples all keywords which must be in lowercase are printed in bold for clarity but that is not requirement of the language next the keywords input and output specify which of the ports are inputs and which are outputs internal connections are declared as wires the circuit in this example has one internal connection at terminal  and is declared with the keyword wire the structure of the circuit is specified by list of predefined primitive gates each identified by descriptive keyword and not or  the elements of the list are referred to as instantiations of gate each of which is referred to as gate instance each gate instantiation consists of an optional name such as   etc  followed by the gate output and inputs separated by commas and enclosed within parentheses the output of primitive gate is always listed first followed by the inputs for example the or gate of the schematic is represented by the or primitive is named  and has output and inputs and  note the output of primitive must be listed first but the inputs and outputs of module may be listed in any order  the module description ends with the keyword endmodule each statement must be terminated with semicolon but there is no semicolon after endmodule it is important to understand the distinction between the terms declaration and instantiation verilog module is declared its declaration specifies the inputcoutput behavior of the hardware that it represents predefined primitives are not declared because their definition is specified by the language and is not subject to change by the user primitives are used e  instantiated  just as gates are used to populate printed circuit board well see that once module has been declared it may be used instantiated within design note that simple circuit is not computational model like those developed in an ordinary programming language the sequential ordering of the statements instantiating gates in the model has no significance and does not specify sequence of computations verilog model is descriptive model simple circuit describes what primitives form circuit and how they are connected the inputcoutput behavior of the circuit is section   hardware description language   table   output of gates after delay time units input output ns abc w initial         change                                      implicitly specified by the description because the behavior of each logic gate is defined thus an hdl based model can be used to simulate the circuit that it represents gate delays all physical circuits exhibit propagation delay between the transition of an input and resulting transition of an output when an hdl model of circuit is simulated it is sometimes necessary to specify the amount of delay from the input to the output of its gates in verilog the propagation delay of gate is specified in terms of time units and by the symbol  the numbers associated with time delays in verilog are dimensionless the association of time unit with physical time is made with the timescale compiler directive  compiler directives start with the  back quote or grave accent symbol  such directive is specified before the declaration of module and applies to all numerical values of time in the code that follows an example of timescale directive is timescale ns  ps the first number specifies the unit of measurement for time delays the second number specifies the precision for which the delays are rounded off in this case to   ns if no timescale is specified simulator may display dimensionless values or default to certain time unit usually  ns      our examples will use only the default time unit hdl example   repeats the description of the simple circuit of example   but with propagation delays specified for each gate the and or and not gates have time delay of     and  ns respectively if the circuit is simulated and the inputs change from b   to b   the outputs change as shown in table   calculated by hand or generated by simulator  the output of the inverter at changes from  to  after  ns delay the output of the and gate at changes from  to  after  ns delay the output of the or gate at changes from  to  at   ns and then changes back to  at   ns in both cases the change in the output of the or gate results from change in its inputs  ns earlier it is clear from this result that although output eventually returns to final value of  after the input changes the gate delays produce negative spike that lasts  ns before the final value is reached hdl example   gate level model with propagation delays   verilog model of simple circuit with propagation delay module simple circuit prop delay b d  output e input b wire  and      b  not     c  or     w   endmodule in order to simulate circuit with an hdl it is necessary to apply inputs to the circuit so that the simulator will generate an output response an hdl description that provides the stimulus to design is called test bench the writing of test benches is explained in more detail at the end of section    here we demonstrate the procedure with simple example without dwelling on too many details hdl example   shows test bench for simulating the circuit with delay  note the distinguishing name simple circuit prop delay  in its simplest form test bench is module containing signal generator and an instantiation of the model that is to be verified note that the test bench simple circuit prop delay has no input or output ports because it does not interact with its environment in general we prefer to name the test bench with the prefix concatenated with the name of the module that is to be tested by the test bench but that choice is left to the designer within the test bench the inputs to the circuit are declared with keyword reg and the outputs are declared with the keyword wire the module simple circuit prop delay is instantiated with the instance name  every instantiation of module must include unique instance name note that using test bench is similar to testing actual hardware by attaching signal generators to the inputs of circuit and attaching hdl example   test bench   test bench for simple circuit prop delay

and the instantiated circuit module is illustrated in fig     hardware signal generators are not used to verify an hdl model the entire simulation exercise is done with software models executing on digital computer under the direction of an hdl simulator the waveforms of the input signals are abstractly modeled generated by verilog statements specifying waveform values and transitions the initial keyword is used with set of statements that begin executing when the simulation is initialized the signal activity associated with initial terminates execution when the last statement has finished executing the initial statements are commonly used to describe waveforms in test bench the set of statements to be executed is called block statement and consists of several statements enclosed by the keywords begin and end the action specified by the statements begins when the simulation is launched and the statements are executed in sequence left to right from top to bottom by simulator in order to provide the input to the circuit initially b    b and are each set to  which signifies one binary digit with value of   after   ns the inputs change to b   after another   ns the simulation terminates at time   ns second initial statement uses the finish system task to specify termination of the simulation if statement is preceded by delay value g     the simulator postpones executing the statement until the specified time delay has elapsed the timing diagram of waveforms that result from the simulation is shown in figure    the total simulation generates waveforms over an interval of   ns the inputs b and change from  to  after   ns output is unknown for the first  ns denoted by shading  and output is unknown for the first  ns output goes from  to  at   ns output goes from  to  at   ns and back to  at   ns just as we predicted in table   boolean expressions boolean equations describing combinational logic are specified in verilog with continuous assignment statement consisting of the keyword assign followed by boolean expression to distinguish arithmetic operators from logical operators verilog uses the symbols      and   for and or and not complement  respectively thus to describe the simple circuit of fig    with boolean expression we use the statement assign     hdl example   describes circuit that is specified with the following two boolean expressions   bc  bd  bc  bcd the equations specify how the logic values and are determined by the values of b and hdl example   combinational logic modeled with boolean equations   verilog model circuit with boolean expressions module circuit boolean ca f b d  output f input b d assign a          assign            endmodule the circuit has two outputs and and four inputs b and the two assign statements describe the boolean equations the values of and during simulation are determined dynamically by the values of b and the simulator detects when the test bench changes value of one or more of the inputs when this happens the simulator updates the values of and the continuous assignment mechanism is so named because the relationship between the assigned value and the variables is permanent the mechanism acts just like combinational logic has gate level equivalent circuit and is referred to as implicit combinational logic we have shown that digital circuit can be described with hdl statements just as it can be drawn in circuit diagram or specified with boolean expression third alternative is to describe combinational logic with truth table user defined primitives the logic gates used in verilog descriptions with keywords and or etc  are defined by the system and are referred to as system primitives  caution other languages may use these words differently  the user can create additional primitives by defining them in tabular form these types of circuits are referred to as user defined primitives udps  one way of specifying digital circuit in tabular form is by means of truth table udp descriptions do not use the keyword pair module    endmodule instead they are declared with the keyword pair primitive    endprimitive the best way to demonstrate udp declaration is by means of an example section   hardware description language   hdl example   defines udp with truth table it proceeds according to the following general rules it is declared with the keyword primitive followed by name and port list there can be only one output and it must be listed rst in the port list and declared with keyword output there can be any number of inputs the order in which they are listed in the input declaration must conform to the order in which they are given values in the table that follows the truth table is enclosed within the keywords table and endtable the values of the inputs are listed in order ending with colon   the output is always the last entry in row and is followed by semicolon   the declaration of udp ends with the keyword endprimitive hdl

system recognizes the variables by the order in which they are listed in the input declaration user defined primitive can be instantiated in the construction of other modules digital circuits  just as the system primitives are used for example the declaration circuit with udp     f b d  will produce circuit that implements the hardware shown in figure    although verilog hdl uses this kind of description for udps only other hdls and computer aided design cad systems use other procedures to specify digital circuits in tabular form the tables can be processed by cad software to derive an efficient gate structure of the design none of verilogs predefined primitives describes sequential logic the model of sequential udp requires that its output be declared as reg data type and that column be added to the truth table to describe the next state so the columns are organized as inputs  state  next state in this section we introduced the verilog hdl and presented simple examples to illustrate alternatives for modeling combinational logic more detailed presentation of verilog hdl can be found in the next chapter the reader familiar with combinational circuits can go directly to

introduction logic circuits for digital systems may be combinational or sequential combinational circuit consists of logic gates whose outputs at any time are determined from only the present combination of inputs combinational circuit performs an operation that can be specified logically by set of boolean functions in contrast sequential circuits employ storage elements in addition to logic gates their outputs are function of the inputs and the state of the storage elements because the state of the storage elements is function of previous inputs the outputs of sequential circuit depend not only on present values of inputs but also on past inputs and the circuit behavior must be specified by time sequence of inputs and internal states sequential circuits are the building blocks of digital systems and are discussed in chapters  and    combinational circuits combinational circuit consists of an interconnection of logic gates combinational logic gates react to the values of the signals at their inputs and produce the value of the output signal transforming binary information from the given input data to required output data block diagram of combinational circuit is shown in fig    the input binary variables come from an external source the output variables are produced by the internal combinational logic circuit and go to an external destination each input and output variable exists physically as an analog signal whose values are interpreted to be binary signal that represents logic  and logic   note logic simulators show only and not the actual analog signals  in many applications the source and   inputs  combinational  outputs circuit figure   block diagram of combinational circuit destination are storage registers if the registers are included with the combinational gates then the total circuit must be considered to be sequential circuit for input variables there are possible combinations of the binary inputs for each possible input combination there is one possible value for each output variable thus combinational circuit can be specified with truth table that lists the output values for each combination of input variables combinational circuit also can be described by boolean functions one for each output variable each output function is expressed in terms of the input variables in chapter  we learned about binary numbers and binary codes that represent discrete quantities of information the binary variables are represented physically by electric voltages or some other type of signal the signals can be manipulated in digital logic gates to perform required functions in chapter  we introduced boolean algebra as way to express logic functions algebraically in chapter  we learned how to simplify boolean functions to achieve economical simpler gate implementations the purpose of the current chapter is to use the knowledge acquired in previous chapters to formulate systematic analysis and design procedures for combinational circuits the solution of some typical examples will provide useful catalog of elementary functions that are important for the understanding of digital systems well address three tasks   analyze the behavior of given logic circuit   synthesize circuit that will have given behavior and   write hardware description language hdl models for some common circuits there are several combinational circuits that are employed extensively in the design of digital systems these circuits are available in integrated circuits and are classified as standard components they perform specific digital functions commonly needed in the design of digital systems in this chapter we introduce the most important standard combinational circuits such as adders subtractors comparators decoders encoders and multiplexers these components are available in integrated circuits as medium scale integration msi circuits they are also used as standard cells in complex very largescale integrated vlsi circuits such as application specific integrated circuits asics  the standard cell functions are interconnected within the vlsi circuit in the same way that they are used in multiple ic msi design   analysis procedure the analysis of combinational circuit requires that we determine the function that the circuit implements this task starts with given logic diagram and culminates with set of boolean functions truth table or possibly an explanation of the circuit operation section   analysis procedure   if the logic diagram to be analyzed is accompanied by function name or an explanation of what it is assumed to accomplish then the analysis problem reduces to verification of the stated function the analysis can be performed manually by finding the boolean functions or truth table or by using computer simulation program the first step in the analysis is to make sure that the given circuit is combinational and not sequential the diagram of combinational circuit has logic gates with no feedback paths or memory elements feedback path is connection from the output of one gate to the input of second gate whose output forms part of the input to the first gate feedback paths in digital circuit define sequential circuit and must be analyzed by special methods and will not be considered here once the logic diagram is verified to be that of combinational circuit one can proceed to obtain the output boolean functions or the truth table if the function of the circuit is under investigation then it is necessary to interpret the operation of the circuit from the derived boolean functions or truth table the success of such an investigation is enhanced if one has previous experience and familiarity with wide variety of digital circuits to obtain the output boolean functions from logic diagram we proceed as follows   label all gate outputs that are function of input variables with arbitrary symbols but with meaningful names determine the boolean functions for each gate output   label the gates that are function of input variables and previously labeled gates with other arbitrary symbols find the boolean functions for these gates   repeat the process outlined in step  until the outputs of the circuit are obtained   by repeated substitution of previously defined functions obtain the output boolean functions in terms of input variables the analysis of the combinational circuit of fig   illustrates the proposed procedure we note that the circuit has three binary inputsa and cand two binary outputsf and  the outputs of various gates are labeled with intermediate symbols the outputs of gates that are function only of input variables are and  output can easily be derived from the input variables the boolean functions for these three outputs are  ab  ac  bc    t  abc next we consider outputs of gates that are function of already defined symbols  t   to obtain as function of b and we form series of substitutions as follows    t  abc  ab  ac  bc     abc           abc   bc  ab  ac  bc  bc  abc  abc  abc  abc  abc t f c a b f b c c figure   logic diagram for analysis example if we want to pursue the investigation and determine the information transformation task achieved by this circuit we can draw the circuit from the derived boolean expressions and try to recognize familiar operation the boolean functions for and implement circuit discussed in section   merely finding boolean representation of circuit doesnt provide insight into its behavior but in this example we will observe that the boolean equations and truth table for and match those describing the functionality of what we call full adder the derivation of the truth table for circuit is straightforward process once the output boolean functions are known to obtain the truth table directly from the logic diagram without going through the derivations of the boolean functions we proceed as follows   determine the number of input variables in the circuit for inputs form the possible input combinations and list the binary numbers from  to   in table   label the outputs of selected gates with arbitrary symbols   obtain the truth table for the outputs of those gates which are function of the input variables only   proceed to obtain the truth table for the outputs of those gates which are function of previously defined values until the columns for all outputs are determined section   design procedure   table   truth table for the logic diagram of fig   b f t t                                                                     this process is illustrated with the circuit of fig    in table   we form the eight possible combinations for the three input variables the truth table for is determined directly from the values of b and with equal to  for any combination that has two or three inputs equal to  the truth table for is the complement of  the truth tables for and are the or and and functions of the input variables respectively the values for are derived from and t is equal to  when both and are equal to  and is equal to  otherwise finally is equal to  for those combinations in which either or or both are equal to  inspection of the truth table combinations for b f  and shows that it is identical to the truth table of the full adder given in section   for y s and respectively another way of analyzing combinational circuit is by means of logic simulation this is not practical however because the number of input patterns that might be needed to generate meaningful outputs could be very large but simulation has very practical application in verifying that the functionality of circuit actually matches its specification in section    we demonstrate the logic simulation and verification of the circuit of fig    using verilog hdl   design procedure the design of combinational circuits starts from the specification of the design objective and culminates in logic circuit diagram or set of boolean functions from which the logic diagram can be obtained the procedure involves the following steps   from the specifications of the circuit determine the required number of inputs and outputs and assign symbol to each   derive the truth table that defines the required relationship between inputs and outputs   obtain the simplified boolean functions for each output as function of the input variables   draw the logic diagram and verify the correctness of the design manually or by simulation  truth table for combinational circuit consists of input columns and output columns the input columns are obtained from the binary numbers for the input variables the binary values for the outputs are determined from the stated specifications the output functions specified in the truth table give the exact definition of the combinational circuit it is important that the verbal specifications be interpreted correctly in the truth table as they are often incomplete and any wrong interpretation may result in an incorrect truth table the output binary functions listed in the truth table are simplified by any available method such as algebraic manipulation the map method or computer based simplification program frequently there is variety of simplified expressions from which to choose in particular application certain criteria will serve as guide in the process of choosing an implementation practical design must consider such constraints as the number of gates number of inputs to gate propagation time of the signal through the gates number of interconnections limitations of the driving capability of each gate e  the number of gates to which the output of the circuit may be connected  and various other criteria that must be taken into consideration when designing integrated circuits since the importance of each constraint is dictated by the particular application it is difficult to make general statement about what constitutes an acceptable implementation in most cases the simplification begins by satisfying an elementary objective such as producing the simplified boolean functions in standard form then the simplification proceeds with further steps to meet other performance criteria code conversion example the availability of large variety of codes for the same discrete elements of information results in the use of different codes by different digital systems it is sometimes necessary to use the output of one system as the input to another conversion circuit must be inserted between the two systems if each uses different codes for the same information thus code converter is circuit that makes the two systems compatible even though each uses different binary code to convert from binary code to binary code the input lines must supply the bit combination of elements as specified by code and the output lines must generate the corresponding bit combination of code a combinational circuit performs this transformation by means of logic gates the design procedure will be illustrated by an example that converts binary coded decimal bcd to the excess  code for the decimal digits the bit combinations assigned to the bcd and excess  codes are listed in table   section    since each code uses four bits to represent decimal digit there must section   design procedure   table   truth table for code conversion example input bcd output excess  code b cd wx z                                                                            be four input variables and four output variables we designate the four input binary variables by the symbols b and and the four output variables by x and the truth table relating the input and output variables is shown in table   the bit combinations for the inputs and their corresponding outputs are obtained directly from section   note that four binary variables may have  bit combinations but only  are listed in the truth table the six bit combinations not listed for the input variables are dont care combinations these values have no meaning in bcd and we assume that they will never occur in actual operation of the circuit therefore we are at liberty to assign to the output variables either  or  whichever gives simpler circuit the maps in fig   are plotted to obtain simplified boolean functions for the outputs each one of the four maps represents one of the four outputs of the circuit as function of the four input variables the marked inside the squares are obtained from the minterms that make the output equal to  the are obtained from the truth table by going over the output columns one at time for example the column under output has five therefore the map for has five each being in square corresponding to the minterm that makes equal to  the six dont care minterms  through  are marked with an one possible way to simplify the functions into sum of products form is listed under the map of each variable  see chapter   two level logic diagram for each output may be obtained directly from the boolean expressions derived from the maps there are various other possibilities for logic diagram that implements this circuit the expressions obtained in fig   may be manipulated algebraically for the purpose of using common gates for two or more outputs this manipulation shown next illustrates the flexibility obtained with multiple output systems when

variety of information processing tasks among the functions encountered are the various arithmetic operations the most basic arithmetic operation is the addition of two binary digits this simple addition consists of four possible elementary operations                  and       the first three operations produce sum of one digit but when both augend and addend bits are equal to  the binary sum consists of two digits the higher significant bit of this result is called carry when the augend and addend numbers contain more significant digits the carry obtained from the addition of two bits is added to the next higher order pair of significant bits combinational circuit that performs the addition of two bits is called half adder one that performs the addition of three bits two significant bits and previous carry is full adder the names of the circuits stem from the fact that two half adders can be employed to implement full adder binary addercsubtractor is combinational circuit that performs the arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction with binary numbers we will develop this circuit by means of hierarchical design the half adder design is carried out first from which we develop the full adder connecting full adders in cascade produces binary adder for two bit numbers the subtraction circuit is included in complementing circuit half adder from the verbal explanation of half adder we find that this circuit needs two binary inputs and two binary outputs the input variables designate the augend and addend bits the output variables produce the sum and carry we assign symbols and to the two inputs and for sum and for carry to the outputs the truth table for the half adder is listed in table   the output is  only when both inputs are  the output represents the least significant bit of the sum the simplified boolean functions for the two outputs can be obtained directly from the truth table the simplified sum of products expressions are  xy

addercsubtractor   full adder addition of bit binary numbers requires the use of full adder and the process of addition proceeds on bit by bit basis right to left beginning with the least significant bit after the least significant bit addition at each position adds not only the respective bits of the words but must also consider possible carry bit from addition at the previous position full adder is combinational circuit that forms the arithmetic sum of three bits it consists of three inputs and two outputs two of the input variables denoted by and represent the two significant bits to be added the third input represents the carry from the previous lower significant position two outputs are necessary because the arithmetic sum of three binary digits ranges in value from  to  and binary representation of  or  needs two bits the two outputs are designated by the symbols for sum and for carry the binary variable gives the value of the least significant bit of the sum the binary variable gives the output carry formed by adding the input carry and the bits of the words the truth table of the full adder is listed in table   the eight rows under the input variables designate all possible combinations of the three variables the output variables are determined from the arithmetic sum of the input bits when all input bits are  the output is  the output is equal to  when only one input is equal to  or when all three inputs are equal to  the output has carry of  if two or three inputs are equal to  the input and output bits of the combinational circuit have different interpretations at various stages of the problem on the one hand physically the binary signals of the inputs are considered binary digits to be added arithmetically to form two digit sum at the output on the other hand the same binary values are considered as variables of boolean functions when expressed in the truth table or when the circuit is implemented with logic gates the maps for the outputs of the full adder are shown in fig    the simplified expressions are  xyz  xyz  xyz  xyz  xy  xz  yz the logic diagram for the full adder implemented in sum of products form is shown in fig    it can

circuit that produces the arithmetic sum of two binary numbers it can be constructed with full adders connected in cascade with the output carry from each full adder connected to the input carry of the next full adder in the chain section   binary addercsubtractor   xy y x z s xy y xy z figure   implementation of full adder with two half adders and an or gate addition of bit numbers requires chain of full adders or chain of one half adder and   full adders in the former case the input carry to the least significant position is fixed at  figure   shows the interconnection of four full adder fa circuits to provide four bit binary ripple carry adder the augend bits of and the addend bits of are designated by subscript numbers from right to left with subscript  denoting the least significant bit the carries are connected in chain through the full adders the input carry to the adder is  and it ripples through the full adders to the output carry  the outputs generate the required sum bits an bit adder requires full adders with each output carry connected to the input carry of the next higher order full adder to demonstrate with specific example consider the two binary numbers    and     their sum    is formed with the four bit adder as follows subscript     input carry     ci augend addend     ai sum     bi output carry     si     ci   the bits are added with full adders starting from the least significant position subscript   to form the sum bit and carry bit the input carry in the least significant position must be  the value of ci  in given significant position is the output carry of the full adder this value is transferred into the input carry of the full adder that adds the bits one higher significant position to the left the sum bits are thus generated starting from the rightmost position and are available as soon as the corresponding previous carry bit is generated all the carries must be generated for the correct sum bits to appear at the outputs the four bit adder is typical example of standard component it can be used in many applications involving arithmetic operations observe that the design of this circuit a a a a fa fa fa fa c s s figure   four bit adder by the classical method would require truth table with     entries since there are nine inputs to the circuit by using an iterative method of cascading standard function it is possible to obtain simple and straightforward implementation carry propagation the addition of two binary numbers in parallel implies that all the bits of the augend and addend are available for computation at the same time as in any combinational circuit the signal must propagate through the gates before the correct output sum is available in the output terminals the total propagation time is equal to the propagation delay of typical gate times the number of gate levels in the circuit the longest propagation delay time in an adder is the time it takes the carry to propagate through the full adders since each bit of the sum output depends on the value of the input carry the value of si at any given stage in the adder will be in its steady state final value only after the input carry to that stage has been propagated in this regard consider output in fig    inputs and are available as soon as input signals are applied to the adder however input carry does not settle to its final value until is available from the previous stage similarly has to wait for and so on down to  thus only after the carry propagates and ripples through all stages will the last output and carry settle to their final correct value the number of gate levels for the carry propagation can be found from the circuit of the full adder the circuit is redrawn with different labels in fig    for convenience the input and output variables use the subscript to denote typical stage of the adder the signals at pi and gi settle to their steady state values after they propagate through their respective gates these two signals are common to all half adders and depend on only the input augend and addend bits the signal from the input carry ci to the output carry ci   propagates through an and gate and an or gate which constitute two gate levels if there are four full adders in the adder the output carry would have      gate levels from to  for an bit adder there are gate levels for the carry to propagate from input to output section   binary addercsubtractor   half adder half adder pi ci ai pi bi si pici gi ci  gi ci figure   full adder with and shown the carry propagation time is an important attribute of the adder because it limits the speed with which two numbers are added although the adderor for that matter any combinational circuitwill always have some value at its output terminals the outputs will not be correct unless the signals are given enough time to propagate through the gates connected from the inputs to the outputs since all other arithmetic operations are implemented by successive additions the time consumed during the addition process is critical an obvious solution for reducing the carry propagation delay time is to employ faster gates with reduced delays however physical circuits have limit to their capability another solution is to increase the complexity of the equipment in such way that the carry delay time is reduced there are several techniques for reducing the carry propagation time in parallel adder the most widely used technique employs the principle of carry lookahead logic consider the circuit of the full adder shown in fig    if we define two new binary variables pi  ai  bi gi  aibi the output sum and carry can respectively be expressed as si  pi  ci ci    gi  pici gi is called carry generate and it produces carry of  when both ai and bi are  regardless of the input carry ci pi is called carry propagate because it determines whether carry into stage will propagate into stage   e  whether an assertion of ci will propagate to an assertion of ci   we now write the boolean functions for the carry outputs of each stage and substitute the value of each ci from the previous equations  input carry   c   c     c    g  p c   c   g  p  p c since the boolean function for each output carry is expressed in sum of products form each function can be implemented with one level of and gates followed by an or gate or by two level nand  the three boolean functions for   and are implemented in the carry lookahead generator shown in fig    note that this circuit can add in less time because does not have to wait for and to propagate in fact is propagated at the same time as and  this gain in speed of operation is achieved at the expense of additional complexity hardware  the construction of four bit adder with carry lookahead scheme is shown in fig    each sum output requires two exclusive or gates the output of the first exclusive or gate generates the pi variable and the and gate generates the gi variable the carries are propagated through the carry lookahead generator similar to that in fig    and applied as inputs to the second exclusive or gate all output carries are generated after p c g c c figure   logic diagram of carry lookahead generator section   binary addercsubtractor   c a p c b p s g carry lookahead generator a p c b p s c figure   four bit adder with carry lookahead delay through two levels of gates thus outputs through have equal propagation delay times the two level circuit for the output carry is not shown this circuit can easily be derived by the equation substitution method binary subtractor the subtraction of unsigned binary numbers can be done most conveniently by means of complements as discussed in section   remember that the subtraction b can be done by taking the complement of and adding it to the complement can be obtained by taking the complement and adding  to the least significant pair of bits the complement can be implemented with inverters and  can be added to the sum through the input carry a a a a c fa fa fa fa s s v figure   four bit addercsubtractor with overflow detection the circuit for subtracting b consists of an adder with inverters placed between each data input and the corresponding input of the full adder the input carry must be equal to  when subtraction is performed the operation thus performed becomes plus the complement of plus  this is equal to plus the complement of for unsigned numbers that gives b if b or the complement of a if  for signed numbers the result is b provided that there is no overflow  see section    the addition and subtraction operations can be combined into one circuit with one common binary adder by including an exclusive or gate with each full adder four bit addercsubtractor circuit is shown in fig    the mode input controls the operation when   the circuit is an adder and when   the circuit becomes subtractor each exclusive or gate receives input and one of the inputs of when   we have    the full adders receive the value of the input carry is  and the circuit performs plus when   we have    and    the inputs are all complemented and  is added through the input carry the circuit performs the operation plus the complement of  the exclusive or with output is for detecting an overflow  it is worth noting that binary numbers in the signed complement system are added and subtracted by the same basic addition and subtraction rules as are unsigned numbers therefore computers need only one common hardware circuit to handle both types of arithmetic the user or programmer must interpret the results of such addition or subtraction differently depending on whether it is assumed that the numbers are signed or unsigned section   binary addercsubtractor   overflow when two numbers with digits each are added and the sum is number occupying   digits we say that an overflow occurred this is true for binary or decimal numbers signed or unsigned when the addition is performed with paper and pencil an overflow is not problem since there is no limit by the width of the page to write down the sum overflow is problem in digital computers because the number of bits that hold the number is finite and result that contains   bits cannot be accommodated by an bit word for this reason many computers detect the occurrence of an overflow and when it occurs corresponding flip flop is set that can then be checked by the user the detection of an overflow after the addition of two binary numbers depends on whether the numbers are considered to be signed or unsigned when two unsigned numbers are added an overflow is detected from the end carry out of the most significant position in the case of signed numbers two details are important the leftmost bit always represents the sign and negative numbers are in complement form when two signed numbers are added the sign bit is treated as part of the number and the end carry does not indicate an overflow an overflow cannot occur after an addition if one number is positive and the other is negative since adding positive number to negative number produces result whose magnitude is smaller than the larger of the two original numbers an overflow may occur if the two numbers added are both positive or both negative to see how this can happen consider the following example two signed binary numbers   and   are stored in two eight bit registers the range of numbers that each register can accommodate is from binary   to binary    since the sum of the two numbers is    it exceeds the capacity of an eight bit register this is also true for   and   the two additions in binary are shown next together with the last two carries carries   carries                                              note that the eight bit result that should have been positive has negative sign bit e  the eighth bit and the eight bit result that should have been negative has positive sign bit if however the carry out of the sign bit position is taken as the sign bit of the result then the nine bit answer so obtained will be correct but since the answer cannot be accommodated within eight bits we say that an overflow has occurred an overflow condition can be detected by observing the carry into the sign bit position and the carry out of the sign bit position if these two carries are not equal an overflow has occurred this is indicated in the examples in which the two carries are explicitly shown if the two carries are applied to an exclusive or gate an overflow is detected when the output of the gate is equal to  for this method to work correctly the complement of negative number must be computed by taking the complement and adding  this takes care of the condition when the maximum negative number is complemented the binary addercsubtractor circuit with outputs and is shown in fig    if the two binary numbers are considered to be unsigned then the bit detects carry after addition or borrow after subtraction if the numbers are considered to be signed then the bit detects an overflow if   after an addition or subtraction then no overflow occurred and the bit result is correct if   then the result of the operation contains   bits but only the rightmost bits of the number fit in the space available so an overflow has occurred the   th bit is the actual sign and has been shifted out of position   decimal adder computers or calculators that perform arithmetic operations directly in the decimal number system represent decimal numbers in binary coded form an adder for such computer must employ arithmetic circuits that accept coded decimal numbers and present results in the same code for binary addition it is sufficient to consider pair of significant bits together with previous carry decimal adder requires minimum of nine inputs and five outputs since four bits are required to code each decimal digit and the circuit must have an input and output carry there is wide variety of possible decimal adder circuits depending upon the code used to represent the decimal digits here we examine decimal adder for the bcd code  see section    bcd adder consider the arithmetic addition of two decimal digits in bcd together with an input carry from previous stage since each input digit does not exceed  the output sum cannot be greater than         the  in the sum being an input carry suppose we apply two bcd digits to four bit binary adder the adder will form the sum in binary and produce result that ranges from  through   these binary numbers are listed in table   and are labeled by symbols z    and  is the carry and the subscripts under the letter represent the weights     and  that can be assigned to the four bits in the bcd code the columns under the binary sum list the binary value that appears in the outputs of the four bit binary adder the output sum of two decimal digits must be represented in bcd and should appear in the form listed in the columns under bcd sum the problem is to find rule by which the binary sum is converted to the correct bcd digit representation of the number in the bcd sum in examining the contents of the table it becomes apparent that when the binary sum is equal to or less than    the corresponding bcd number is identical and therefore no conversion is needed when the binary sum is greater than    we obtain an invalid bcd representation the addition of binary     to the binary sum converts it to the correct bcd representation and also produces an output carry as required section   decimal adder   table   bcd sum decimal derivation of bcd adder s s  binary sum        z z                                                                                                                                                                                                                          the logic circuit that detects the necessary correction can be derived from the entries in the table it is obvious that correction is needed when the binary sum has an output carry   the other six combinations from   through   that need correction have  in position  to distinguish them from binary   and    which also have  in position  we specify further that either or must have  the condition for correction and an output carry can be expressed by the boolean function   z  z when   it is necessary to add   to the binary sum and provide an output carry for the next stage bcd adder that adds two bcd digits and produces sum digit in bcd is shown in fig    the two decimal digits together with the input carry are first added in the top four bit adder to produce the binary sum when the output carry is equal to  nothing is added to the binary sum when it is equal to  binary   is added to the binary sum through the bottom four bit adder the output carry generated from the bottom addend carry  bit binary adder carry z z in out output carry   bit binary adder s s figure   block diagram of bcd adder adder can be ignored since it supplies information already available at the output carry terminal decimal parallel adder that adds decimal digits needs bcd adder stages the output carry from one stage must be connected to the input carry of the next higher order stage   binary multiplier multiplication of binary numbers is performed in the same way as multiplication of decimal numbers the multiplicand is multiplied by each bit of the multiplier starting from the least significant bit each such multiplication forms partial product successive partial products are shifted one position to the left the final product is obtained from the sum of the partial products to see how binary multiplier can be implemented with combinational circuit consider the multiplication of two  bit numbers as shown in fig    the multiplicand section   binary multiplier   b b a a a a c a c b c ha ha c c figure   two bit by two bit binary multiplier bits are and  the multiplier bits are and  and the product is c c  the first partial product is formed by multiplying b by  the multiplication of two bits such as and produces  if both bits are  otherwise it produces  this is identical to an and operation therefore the partial product can be implemented with and gates as shown in the diagram the second partial product is formed by multiplying b by and shifting one position to the left the two partial products are added with two half adder ha circuits usually there are more bits in the partial products and it is necessary to use full adders to produce the sum of the partial products note that the least significant bit of the product does not have to go through an adder since it is formed by the output of the first and gate combinational circuit binary multiplier with more bits can be constructed in similar fashion bit of the multiplier is anded with each bit of the multiplicand in as many levels as there are bits in the multiplier the binary output in each level of and gates is added with the partial product of the previous level to form new partial product the last level produces the product for multiplier bits and multiplicand bits we need  and gates and  bit adders to produce product of  bits as second example consider multiplier circuit that multiplies binary number represented by four bits by number represented by three bits let the multiplicand be represented by b b and the multiplier by a  since   and   we need  and gates and two  bit adders to produce product of seven bits the logic diagram of the multiplier is shown in fig    a b b  addend augend  bit adder sum and output carry b b addend

greater than less than or equal to the other number magnitude comparator is combinational circuit that compares two numbers and and determines their relative magnitudes the outcome of the comparison is specified by three binary variables that indicate whether  a  or  on the one hand the circuit for comparing two bit numbers has  entries in the truth table and becomes too cumbersome even with   on the other hand as one section   magnitude comparator   may suspect comparator circuit possesses certain amount of regularity digital functions that possess an inherent well defined regularity can usually be designed by means of an algorithma procedure which specifies finite set of steps that if followed give the solution to problem we illustrate this method here by deriving an algorithm for the design of four bit magnitude comparator the algorithm is direct application of the procedure person uses to compare the relative magnitudes of two numbers consider two numbers and with four digits each write the coefficients of the numbers in descending order of significance  a a  b b each subscripted letter represents one of the digits in the number the two numbers are equal if all pairs of significant digits are equal       and   when the numbers are binary the digits are either  or  and the equality of each pair of bits can be expressed logically with an exclusive nor function as xi  aibi  ai bi for       where xi   only if the pair of bits in position are equal e  if both are  or both are   the equality of the two numbers and is displayed in combinational circuit by an output binary variable that we designate by the symbol   this binary variable is equal to  if the input numbers and are equal and is equal to  otherwise for equality to exist all xi variables must be equal to  condition that dictates an and operation of all variables    x x the binary variable  is equal to  only if all pairs of digits of the two numbers are equal to determine whether is greater or less than we inspect the relative magnitudes of pairs of significant digits starting from the most significant position if the two digits of pair are equal we compare the next lower significant pair of digits the comparison continues until pair of unequal digits is reached if the corresponding digit of is  and that of is  we conclude that  if the corresponding digit of is  and that of is  we have  the sequential comparison can be expressed logically by the two boolean functions   b  a  x b  x a    b  a  x b  x an the symbols  and  are binary output variables that are equal to  when  and  respectively the gate implementation of the three output variables just derived is simpler than it seems because it involves certain amount of repetition the unequal outputs can use the same gates that are needed to generate the equal output the logic diagram of the four bit magnitude comparator is shown in fig    the four outputs are generated x a  b b x a  b b  b figure   four bit magnitude comparator with exclusive nor circuits and are applied to an and gate to give the output binary variable   the other two outputs use the variables to generate the boolean functions listed previously this is multilevel implementation and has regular pattern the procedure for obtaining magnitude comparator circuits for binary numbers with more than four bits is obvious from this example   decoders discrete quantities of information are represented in digital systems by binary codes binary code of bits is capable of representing up to distinct elements of coded information decoder is combinational circuit that converts binary information from section   decoders   input lines to maximum of unique output lines if the bit coded information has unused combinations the decoder may have fewer than outputs the decoders presented here are called to line decoders where n their purpose is to generate the or fewer minterms of input variables each combination of inputs will assert unique output the name decoder is also used in conjunction with other code converters such as bcd to seven segment decoder as an example consider the three to eight line decoder circuit of fig    the three inputs are decoded into eight outputs each representing one of the minterms of the three input variables the three inverters provide the complement of the inputs and each one of the eight and gates generates one of the minterms particular application of this decoder is binary to octal conversion the input variables represent binary number and the outputs represent the eight digits of number in the octal number system however three to eight line decoder can be used for decoding any three bit code to provide eight outputs one for each element of the code xyz d xyz xyz d xyz d xyz xyz xyz xyz figure   three to eight line decoder table   truth table of three to eight line decoder inputs outputs y d                                                                                                 the operation of the decoder may be clarified by the truth table listed in table   for each possible input combination there are seven outputs that are equal to  and only one that is equal to  the output whose value is equal to  represents the minterm equivalent of the binary number currently available in the input lines some decoders are constructed with nand gates since nand gate produces the and operation with an inverted output it becomes more economical to generate the decoder minterms in their complemented form furthermore decoders include one or more enable inputs to control the circuit operation two to four line decoder with an enable input constructed with nand gates is shown in fig    the circuit operates with complemented outputs and complement enable input the decoder is enabled when is equal to  e  active low enable  as indicated by the truth table only one eab d d  xx                      truth table a logic diagram figure   two to four line decoder with enable input section   decoders   output can be equal to  at any given time all other outputs are equal to  the output whose value is equal to  represents the minterm selected by inputs and the circuit is disabled when is equal to  regardless of the values of the other two inputs when the circuit is disabled none of the outputs are equal to  and none of the minterms are selected in general decoder may operate with complemented or uncomplemented outputs the enable input may be activated with  or with  signal some decoders have two or more enable inputs that must satisfy given logic condition in order to enable the circuit decoder with enable input can function as demultiplexera circuit that receives information from single line and directs it to one of possible output lines the selection of specific output is controlled by the bit combination of selection lines the decoder of fig    can function as one to four line demultiplexer when is taken as data input line and and are taken as the selection inputs the single input variable has path to all four outputs but the input information is directed to only one of the output lines as specified by the binary combination of the two selection lines and this feature can be verified from the truth table of the circuit for example if the selection lines ab    output will be the same as the input value while all other outputs are maintained at  because decoder and demultiplexer operations are obtained from the same circuit decoder with an enable input is referred to as decodercdemultiplexer decoders with enable inputs can be connected together to form larger decoder circuit figure   shows two  to  line decoders with enable inputs connected to form  to  line decoder when  the top decoder is enabled and the other is disabled the bottom decoder outputs are all and the top eight outputs generate minterms   to    when  the enable conditions are reversed the bottom decoder outputs generate minterms   to    while the outputs of the top decoder are all this example demonstrates the usefulness of enable inputs in decoders and other y  to decoder e  to  decoder figure       decoder constructed with two    decoders combinational logic components in general enable inputs are convenient feature for interconnecting two or more standard components for the purpose of combining them into similar function with more inputs and outputs combinational logic implementation decoder provides the minterms of input variables each asserted output of the decoder is associated with unique pattern of input bits since any boolean function can be expressed in sum of minterms form decoder that generates the minterms of the function together with an external or gate that forms their logical sum provides hardware implementation of the function in this way any combinational circuit with inputs and outputs can be implemented with an to line decoder and or gates the procedure for implementing combinational circuit by means of decoder and or gates requires that the boolean function for the circuit be expressed as sum of minterms decoder is then chosen that generates all the minterms of the input variables the inputs to each or gate are selected from the decoder outputs according to the list of minterms of each function this procedure will be illustrated by an example that implements full adder circuit from the truth table of the full adder see table    we obtain the functions for the combinational circuit in sum of minterms form x z         x z         since there are three inputs and total of eight minterms we need three to eight line decoder the implementation is shown in fig    the decoder generates the eight minterms for y and the or gate for output forms the logical sum of minterms     and  the or gate for output forms the logical sum of minterms     and    x        decoder      figure   implementation of full adder with decoder section   encoders   function with long list of minterms requires an or gate with large number of inputs function having list of minterms can be expressed in its complemented form with k minterms if the number of minterms in the function is greater than  then can be expressed with fewer minterms in such case it is advantageous to use nor gate to sum the minterms of the output of the nor gate complements this sum and generates the normal output if nand gates are used for the decoder as in fig    then the external gates must be nand gates instead of or gates this is because two level nand gate circuit implements sum of minterms function and is equivalent to two level andcor circuit    encoders an encoder is digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of decoder an encoder has or fewer input lines and output lines the output lines as an aggregate generate the binary code corresponding to the input value an example of an encoder is the octal to binary encoder whose truth table is given in table   it has eight inputs one for each of the octal digits and three outputs that generate the corresponding binary number it is assumed that only one input has value of  at any given time the encoder can be implemented with or gates whose inputs are determined directly from the truth table output is equal to  when the input octal digit is     or  output is  for octal digits     or  and output is  for digits     or  these conditions can be expressed by the following boolean output functions     y     x     the encoder can be implemented with three or gates table   outputs truth table of an octal to binary encoder y inputs    d d d d                                                                                      the encoder defined in table   has the limitation that only one input can be active at any given time if two inputs are active simultaneously the output produces an undefined combination for example if and are  simultaneously the output of the encoder will be   because all three outputs are equal to  the output   does not represent either binary  or binary  to resolve this ambiguity encoder circuits must establish an input priority to ensure that only one input is encoded if we establish higher priority for inputs with higher subscript numbers and if both and are  at the same time the output will be   because has higher priority than  another ambiguity in the octal to binary encoder is that an output with all is generated when all the inputs are  but this output is the same as when is equal to  the discrepancy can be resolved by providing one more output to indicate whether at least one input is equal to  priority encoder priority encoder is an encoder circuit that includes the priority function the operation of the priority encoder is such that if two or more inputs are equal to  at the same time the input having the highest priority will take precedence the truth table of four input priority encoder is given in table   in addition to the two outputs and the circuit has third output designated by this is valid bit indicator that is set to  when one or more inputs are equal to  if all inputs are  there is no valid input and is equal to  the other two outputs are not inspected when equals  and are specified as dont care conditions note that whereas xs in output columns represent dont care conditions the xs in the input columns are useful for representing truth table in condensed form instead of listing all  minterms of four variables the truth table uses an to represent either  or  for example  represents the two minterms   and    according to table   the higher the subscript number the higher the priority of the input input has the highest priority so regardless of the values of the other inputs when this input is  the output for xy is   binary   has the next priority level the output is  if    provided that    regardless of the values of the other two lower priority inputs the output for is generated only if higher priority inputs are  and so on down the priority levels table   outputs truth table of priority encoder y inputs xx  d d                       xx   xxx  section   encoders   d d d d       d       m m m m         m m m m          m

although the table has only five rows when each in row is replaced first by  and then by  we obtain all  possible input combinations for example the fourth row in the table with inputs xx  represents the four minterms          and   the simplified boolean expressions for the priority encoder are obtained from the maps the condition for output is an or function of all the input variables the priority encoder is implemented in fig    according to the following boolean functions   y   d     d y x v figure   four input priority encoder   multiplexers multiplexer is combinational circuit that selects binary information from one of many input lines and directs it to single output line the selection of particular input line is controlled by set of selection lines normally there are input lines and selection lines whose bit combinations determine which input is selected two to one line multiplexer connects one of two  bit sources to common destination as shown in fig    the circuit has two data input lines one output line and one selection line when   the upper and gate is enabled and has path to the output when   the lower and gate is enabled and has path to the output the multiplexer acts like an electronic switch that selects one of two sources the block diagram of multiplexer is sometimes depicted by wedge shaped symbol as shown in fig     it suggests visually how selected one of multiple data sources is directed into single destination the multiplexer is often labeled mux in block diagrams four to one line multiplexer is shown in fig    each of the four inputs through  is applied to one input of an and gate selection lines and are decoded to select particular and gate the outputs of the and gates are applied to single or gate that provides the one line output the function table lists the input that is passed to the output for each combination of the binary selection values to demonstrate the operation of the circuit consider the case when s    the and gate associated with input has two of its inputs equal to  and the third input connected to  the other three and gates have at least one input equal to  which makes their outputs equal to  the output of the or gate is now equal to the value of  providing path from the selected input to the output multiplexer is also called data selector since it selects one of many inputs and steers the binary information to the output line the and gates and inverters in the multiplexer resemble decoder circuit and indeed they decode the selection input lines in general n to  line multiplexer is constructed from an to decoder by adding input lines to it one to each and gate the outputs of the and gates are applied to single or gate the size of multiplexer is specified by i  mux i  s b block

in the inactive state the outputs are disabled and when it is in the active state the circuit functions as normal multiplexer multiplexer circuits can be combined with common selection inputs to provide multiple bit selection logic as an illustration quadruple  to  line multiplexer is shown in fig    the circuit has four multiplexers each capable of selecting one of two input lines output can be selected to come from either input or input  similarly output may have the value of or  and so on input selection line selects one of the lines in each of the four multiplexers the enable input must be active e  asserted for normal operation although the circuit contains four  to  line multiplexers we are more likely to view it as circuit that selects one of two  bit sets of data lines as shown in the function table the unit is enabled when   then if   the four inputs have path to the four outputs if by contrast   the four inputs are applied to the outputs the outputs have all when   regardless of the value of boolean function implementation in section   it was shown that decoder can be used to implement boolean functions by employing external or gates an examination of the logic diagram of multiplexer reveals that it is essentially decoder that includes the or gate within the unit the y y y y e output b  all   select   select b function table s select enable figure   quadruple two to one line multiplexer minterms of function are generated in multiplexer by the circuit associated with the selection inputs the individual minterms can be selected by the data inputs thereby providing method of implementing boolean function of variables with multiplexer that has selection inputs and data inputs one for each minterm we will now show more efficient method for implementing boolean function of variables with multiplexer that has  selection inputs the first  variables of the function are connected to the selection inputs of the multiplexer the remaining single variable of the function is used for the data inputs if the single variable is denoted section   multiplexers   by each data input of the multiplexer will be z   or  to demonstrate this procedure consider the boolean function x z         this function of three variables can be implemented with four to one line multiplexer as shown in fig    the two variables and are applied to the selection lines in that order is connected to the input and to the input the values for the data input lines are determined from the truth table of the function when xy    output is equal to because   when   and   when   this requires that variable be applied to data input  the operation of the multiplexer is such that when xy    data input  has path to the output and that makes equal to in similar fashion we can determine the required input to data lines    and  from the value of when xy      and   respectively this particular example shows all four possibilities that can be obtained for the data inputs the general procedure for implementing any boolean function of variables with multiplexer with  selection inputs and  data inputs follows from the previous example to begin with boolean function is listed in truth table then first  variables in the table are applied to the selection inputs of the multiplexer for each combination of the selection variables we evaluate the output as function of the last variable this function can be    the variable or the complement of the variable these values are then applied to the data inputs in the proper order as second example consider the implementation of the boolean function a c                 this function is implemented with multiplexer with three selection inputs as shown in fig    note that the first variable must be connected to selection input so that b and correspond to selection inputs   and  respectively the values for the   mux s y zf s     fz        z                         truth table multiplexer implementation

input function with multiplexer data inputs are determined from the truth table listed in the figure the corresponding data line number is determined from the binary combination of abc for example the table shows that when abc     so the input variable is applied to data input  the binary constants  and  correspond to two fixed signal values when integrated circuits are used logic  corresponds to signal ground and logic  is equivalent to the power signal depending on the technology g    three state gates multiplexer can be constructed with three state gatesdigital circuits that exhibit three states two of the states are signals equivalent to logic  and logic  as in conventional gate the third state is high impedance state in which   the logic behaves like an open circuit which means that the output appears to be disconnected   the circuit has no logic significance and   the circuit connected to the output of the three state gate is not affected by the inputs to the gate three state gates may perform any conventional logic such as and or nand however the one most commonly used is the buffer gate the graphic symbol for three state buffer gate is shown in fig    it is distinguished from normal buffer by an input control line entering the bottom of the symbol the buffer has normal input an output and control input that determines the state of the output when the control input is equal to  the output is enabled and the gate behaves like conventional buffer with the output equal to the normal input when the control section   multiplexers   normal input output a if  high impedance if  control input figure   graphic symbol for three state buffer input is  the output is disabled and the gate goes to high impedance state regardless of the value in the normal input the high impedance state of three state gate provides special feature not available in other gates because of this feature large number of three state gate outputs can be connected with wires to form common line without endangering loading effects the construction of multiplexers with three state buffers is demonstrated in fig    figure   shows the construction of two to one line multiplexer with  three state buffers and an inverter the two outputs are connected together to form single output line  note that this type of connection cannot be made with gates that do not have three state outputs  when the select input is  the upper buffer is enabled by its control input and the lower buffer is disabled output is then equal to input when the select input is  the lower buffer is enabled and is equal to the construction of four to one line multiplexer is shown in fig     the outputs of  three state buffers are connected together to form single output line the control inputs to the buffers determine which one of the four normal inputs through y i y b  select select  enable  decoder   to  line mux en figure   multiplexers with three state gates   to  line mux will be connected to the output line no more than one buffer may be in the active state at any given time the connected buffers must be controlled so that only  threestate buffer has access to the output while all other buffers are maintained in highimpedance state one way to ensure that no more than one control input is active at any given time is to use decoder as shown in the diagram when the enable input of the decoder is  all of its four outputs are  and the bus line is in high impedance state because all four buffers are disabled when the enable input is active one of the threestate buffers will be active depending on the binary value in the select inputs of the decoder careful investigation reveals that this circuit is another way of constructing four to one line multiplexer    hdl models of combinational circuits the verilog hdl was introduced in section    in the current section we introduce additional features of verilog present more elaborate examples and compare alternative descriptions of combinational circuits in verilog sequential circuits are presented in chapter  as mentioned previously the module is the basic building block for modeling hardware with the verilog hdl the logic of module can be described in any one or combination of the following modeling styles gate level modeling using instantiations of predefined and user defined primitive gates dataflow modeling using continuous assignment statements with the keyword assign behavioral modeling using procedural assignment statements with the keyword always gate level structural modeling describes circuit by specifying its gates and how they are connected with each other dataflow modeling is used mostly for describing the boolean equations of combinational logic well also consider here behavioral modeling that is used to describe combinational and sequential circuits at higher level of abstraction combinational logic can be designed with truth tables boolean equations and schematics verilog has construct corresponding to each of these classical approaches to design user defined primitives continuous assignments and primitives as shown in fig    there is one other modeling style called switch level modeling it is sometimes used in the simulation of mos transistor circuit models but not in logic synthesis we will not consider switch level modeling gate level modeling gate level modeling was introduced in section   with simple example in this type of representation circuit is specified by its logic gates and their interconnections gatelevel modeling provides textual description of schematic diagram the verilog hdl section   hdl models of combinational circuits   verilog model combinational logic continuous assignment boolean equation truth table schematic figure   relationship of verilog constructs to truth tables boolean equations and schematics includes  basic gates as predefined primitives four of these primitive gates are of the three state type the other eight are the same as the ones listed in section   they are all declared with the lowercase keywords and nand or nor xor xnor not and buf primitives such as and are input primitives they can have any number of scalar inputs g  three input and primitive  the buf and not primitives are output primitives single input can drive multiple output lines distinguished by their identifiers the verilog language includes functional description of each type of gate too the logic of each gate is based on four valued system when the gates are simulated the simulator assigns one value to the output of each gate at any instant in addition to the two logic values of  and  there are two other values unknown and high impedance an unknown value is denoted by and high impedance by an unknown value is assigned during simulation when the logic value of signal is ambiguousfor instance if it cannot be determined whether its value is  or  g  flip flop without reset condition  high impedance condition occurs at the output of three state gates that are not enabled or if wire is inadvertently left unconnected the four valued logic truth tables for the and or xor and not primitives are shown in table   the truth table for the other four gates is the same except that the outputs are complemented note that for the and gate the output is  only when both inputs are  and the output is  if any input is  otherwise if one input is or the output is the output of the or gate is  if both inputs are  is  if any input is  and is otherwise when primitive gate is listed in module we say that it is instantiated in the module in general component instantiations are statements that reference lower level components in the design essentially creating unique copies or instances of those components in the higher level module thus module that uses gate in its description is said to table   truth table for predefined primitive gates and   z or   z       xx   xx     xxx x xx xxx x xx xor   z not input output   xx     xx   xxxx x xxxx x instantiate the gate think of instantiation as the hdl counterpart of placing and connecting parts on circuit board we now present two examples of gate level modeling both examples use identifiers having multiple bit widths called vectors the syntax specifying vector includes within square brackets two numbers separated with colon the following verilog statements specify two vectors output    wire    sum the first statement declares an output vector with four bits  through  the second declares wire vector sum with eight bits numbered  through   note the first leftmost number array index listed is always the most significant bit of the vector  the individual bits are specified within square brackets so  specifies bit  of it is also possible to address parts contiguous bits of vectors for example sum    specifies the three least significant bits of vector sum hdl example   shows the gate level description of two to four line decoder  see fig     this decoder has two data inputs and and an enable input the four outputs are specified with the vector the wire declaration is for internal connections three not gates produce the complement of the inputs and four nand gates provide the outputs for remember that the output is always listed first in the port list of primitive followed by the inputs this example describes the decoder of fig    and follows the procedures established in section    note that the keywords not and nand are written only once and do not have to be repeated for each gate but commas must be inserted at the end of each of the gates in the series except for the last statement which must be terminated with semicolon section   hdl models of combinational circuits   hdl example   two to four line decoder   gate

design there are two basic types of design methodologies top down and bottom up in top down design the top level block is defined and then the subblocks necessary to build the top level block are identified in bottom up design the building blocks are first identified and then combined to build the top level block take for example the binary adder of fig    it can be considered as top block component built with four full adder blocks while each full adder is built with two half adder blocks in top down design the four bit adder is defined first and then the two adders are described in bottom up design the half adder is defined then each full adder is constructed and then the four bit adder is built from the full adders bottom up hierarchical description of four bit adder is shown in hdl example   the half adder is defined by instantiating primitive gates the next module describes the full adder by instantiating and connecting two half adders the third module describes the four bit adder by instantiating and connecting four full adders note that the first character of an identifier cannot be number but can be an underscore so the module name  bitadder is valid an alternative name that is meaningful but does not require leading underscore is adder  bit the instantiation is done by using the name of the module that is instantiated together with new or the same set of port names for example the half adder ha inside the full adder module is instantiated with ports   and this produces half adder with outputs and and inputs and hdl example   ripple carry adder   gate level

the mode g  output  type reg  and declaration of vector range g      of port the first version of the standard    uses separate statements for these declarations section   hdl models of combinational circuits   note that modules can be instantiated nested within other modules but module declarations cannot be nested that is module definition declaration cannot be placed within another module declaration in other words module definition cannot be inserted into the text between the module and endmodule keywords of another module the only way one module definition can be incorporated into another module is by instantiating it instantiating modules within other modules creates hierarchical decomposition of design description of module is said to be structural description if it is composed of instantiations of other modules note also that instance names must be specified when defined modules are instantiated such as fa for the first full adder in the third module  but using name is optional when instantiating primitive gates module ripple carry  bit adder is composed of instantiated and interconnected full adders each of which is itself composed of half adders and some glue logic the top level or parent module of the design hierarchy is the module ripple carry  bit adder four copies of full adder are its child modules etc is an input of the cell forming the least significant bit of the chain and is the output of the cell forming the most significant bit three state gates as mentioned in section    three state gate has control input that can place the gate into high impedance state the high impedance state is symbolized by in verilog there are four types of three state gates as shown in fig    the bufif gate behaves like normal buffer if control   the output goes to high impedance state when control   the bufif gate behaves in similar fashion except that the high impedance state occurs when control   the two notif gates operate in similar manner except that the output is the complement of the input when the gate is not in high impedance state the gates are instantiated with the statement gate name output input control  in out in out control bufif control bufif in out in out control notif control notif figure   three state gates the gate name can be that of any  of the  three state gates in simulation the output can result in    or two examples of gate instantiation are bufif  out control  notif  b enable  in the first example input is transferred to out when control   out goes to when control   in the second example output  when enable   and output  when enable   the outputs of three state gates can be connected together to form common output line to identify such connection verilog hdl uses the keyword tri for tristate to indicate that the output has multiple drivers as an example consider the two to oneline multiplexer with three state gates shown in fig    the hdl description must use tri data type for the output   mux with three state output module mux tri out b select  output out input b select tri out bufif  out select  bufif  out select  endmodule the  three state buffers have the same output in order to show that they have common connection it is necessary to declare out with the keyword tri keywords wire and tri are examples of set of data types called nets which represent connections between hardware elements in simulation their value is determined by continuous assignment statement or by the device whose output they represent the word net is not keyword but represents class of data types such as wire wor wand tri supply  and supply  the wire declaration is used most frequently in fact if an identifier is used but not declared the language specifies that it will be interpreted by default as wire the net wor models the hardware implementation of the wired or configuration emitter coupled logic  the wand models the wired and configuration open collector technology see fig     the nets supply and supply represent power supply and ground respectively they are used to hardwire an input of device to either  or  m out select figure   two to one line multiplexer with three state buffers section   hdl models of combinational circuits   dataflow modeling dataflow modeling of combinational logic uses number of operators that act on binary operands to produce binary result verilog hdl provides about  different operators table   lists some of these operators their symbols and the operation that they perform  complete list of operators supported by verilog      can be found in table   in section    it is necessary to distinguish between arithmetic and logic operations so different symbols are used for each the plus symbol   indicates the arithmetic operation of addition the bitwise logic and operation conjunction uses the symbol  there are special symbols for bitwise logical or disjunction  not and xor the equality symbol uses two equals signs without spaces between them to distinguish it from the equals sign used with the assign statement the bitwise operators operate bit by bit on pair of vector operands to produce vector result the concatenation operator provides mechanism for appending multiple operands for example two operands with two bits each can be concatenated to form an operand with four bits the conditional operator acts like multiplexer and is explained later in conjunction with hdl example   it should be noted that bitwise operator g   and its corresponding logical operator g    may produce different results depending on their operand if the operands are scalar the results will be identical if the operands are vectors the result will not necessarily match for example      is     and     is  binary value is considered to be logically true if it is not  in general use the bitwise operators to describe arithmetic operations and the logical operators to describe logical operations dataflow modeling uses continuous assignments and the keyword assign continuous assignment is statement that assigns value to net the data type family net is used in verilog hdl to represent physical connection between circuit elements net table   some

is connected to if the net is connected to an output of gate the net is said to be driven by the gate and the logic value of the net is determined by the logic values of the inputs to the gate and the truth table of the gate if the identifier of net is the left hand side of continuous assignment statement or procedural assignment statement the value assigned to the net is specified by boolean expression that uses operands and operators as an example assuming that the variables were declared two to one line multiplexer with scalar data inputs and select input and output is described with the continuous assignment assign a     the relationship between a and is declared by the keyword assign followed by the target output and an equals sign following the equals sign is boolean expression in hardware terms this assignment would be equivalent to connecting the output of the or gate to wire the next two examples show the dataflow models of the two previous gate level examples the dataflow description of two to four line decoder with active low output enable and inverted output is shown in hdl example   the circuit is defined with four continuous assignment statements using boolean expressions one for each output the dataflow description of the four bit adder is shown in hdl example   the addition logic is described by single statement using the operators of addition and concatenation the plus symbol  specifies the binary addition of the four bits of with the four bits of and the one bit of in the target output is the concatenation of the output carry out and the four

describe combinational circuits here we give two simple combinational circuit examples to introduce the subject behavioral modeling is presented in more detail in section   after the study of sequential circuits behavioral descriptions use the keyword always followed by an optional event control expression and list of procedural assignment statements the event control expression specifies when the statements will execute the target output of procedural assignment statement must be of the reg data type contrary to the wire data type whereby the target output of an assignment may be continuously updated reg data type retains its value until new value is assigned hdl example   shows the behavioral description of two to one line multiplexer  compare it with hdl example    since variable out is target output it must be declared as reg data in addition to the output declaration  the procedural assignment statements inside the always block are executed every time there is change in any of the variables listed after the  symbol  note that there is no semicolon   at the end of the always statement  in this case these variables are the input variables b and select the statements execute if b or select changes value note that the keyword or instead of the bitwise logical or operator  is used between variables the conditional statement ifcelse provides decision based upon the value of the select input the if statement can be written without the equality symbol if select out the statement implies that select is checked for logic  section   hdl models of

in value the case statement is multiway conditional branch construct whenever in  in  in  in  or select change the case expression select is evaluated and its value compared from top to bottom with the values in the list of statements that follow the so called case items the statement associated with the first case item that matches the case expression is executed in the absence of match no statement is executed since select is two bit number it can be equal to       or   the case items have an implied priority because the list is evaluated from top to bottom the list is called sensitivity list verilog       and is equivalent to the event control expression verilog    formed by oring the signals combinational logic is reactivewhen an input changes an output may change hdl

letter preceded by prime the size of the number is written first and then its value thus   specifies two bit binary number whose value is   numbers are stored as bit pattern in memory but they can be referenced in decimal octal or hexadecimal formats with the letters do and respectively for example  ha    and have the same internal representation in simulator if the base of the number is not specified its interpretation defaults to decimal if the size of the number is not specified the system assumes that the size of the number is at least  bits if host simulator has larger word lengthsay   bitsthe language will use that value to store unsized numbers the integer data type keyword integer is stored in  bit representation the underscore   may be inserted in number to improve readability of the code g             it has no other effect the case construct has two important variations casex and casez the first will treat as dont cares any bits of the case expression or the case item that have logic value or the casez construct treats as dont cares only the logic value for the purpose of detecting match between the case expression and case item the list of case items need not be complete if the list of case items does not include all possible bit patterns of the case expression no match can be detected unlisted case items e  bit patterns that are not explicitly decoded can be treated by using the default keyword as the last item in the list of case items the associated statement will execute when no other match is found this feature is useful for example when there are more possible state codes in sequential machine than are actually used having default case item lets the designer map all of the unused states to desired next state without having to elaborate each individual state rather than allowing the synthesis tool to arbitrarily assign the next state the examples of behavioral descriptions of combinational circuits shown here are simple ones behavioral modeling and procedural assignment statements require knowledge of sequential circuits and are covered in more detail in section   writing simple test bench test bench is an hdl program used for describing and applying stimulus to an hdl model of circuit in order to test it and observe its response during simulation test benches can be quite complex and lengthy and may take longer to develop than the design that is tested the results of test are only as good as the test bench that is used to test circuit care must be taken to write stimuli that will test circuit thoroughly exercising all of the operating features that are specified however the test benches considered here are relatively simple since the circuits we want to test implement only combinational logic the examples are presented to demonstrate some basic features of hdl stimulus modules chapter  considers test benches in greater depth in addition to employing the always statement test benches use the initial statement to provide stimulus to the circuit being tested we use the term always statement loosely actually always is verilog language construct specifying how the associated statement is to execute subject to the event control expression  the always statement section   hdl models of combinational circuits   executes repeatedly in loop the initial statement executes only once starting from simulation time  and may continue with any operations that are delayed by given number of time units as specified by the symbol  for example consider the initial block initial begin          end the block is enclosed between the keywords begin and end at time  and are set to  ten time units later is changed to  twenty time units after that at   is changed to  and to  inputs specified by three bit truth table can be generated with the initial block initial begin b   repeat     d   end when the simulator runs the three bit vector is initialized to   at time  the keyword repeat specifies looping statement is incremented by  seven times once every  time units the result is sequence of binary numbers from   to   stimulus module has the following form module test module name   declare local reg and wire identifiers   instantiate the design module under test   specify stopwatch using finish to terminate the simulation   generate stimulus using initial and always statements   display the output response text or graphics or both  endmodule test module is written like any other module but it typically has no inputs or outputs the signals that are applied as inputs to the design module for simulation are declared in the stimulus module as local reg data type the outputs of the design module that are displayed for testing are declared in the stimulus module as local wire data type the module under test is then instantiated using the local identifiers in its port list figure   clarifies this relationship the stimulus module generates inputs for the design module by declaring local identifiers a and b as reg type and checks the output of the design unit with the wire identifier c the local identifiers are then used to instantiate the design module being tested the simulator associates the actual local identifiers within the test bench a b and c with the formal identifiers of the module circuit module circuit   b  reg a b wire c input b parameter stop time

 the association shown here is based on position in the port list which is adequate for the examples that we will consider the reader should note however that verilog provides more flexible name association mechanism for connecting ports in larger circuits the response to the stimulus generated by the initial and always blocks will appear in text format as standard output and as waveforms timing diagrams in simulators having graphical output capability numerical outputs are displayed by using verilog system tasks these are built in system functions that are recognized by keywords that begin with the symbol  some of the system tasks that are useful for display are displaydisplay one time value of variables or strings with an end of line return  writesame as display but without going to next line  monitordisplay variables whenever value changes during simulation run  timedisplay the simulation time  finishterminate the simulation the syntax for display  write and monitor is of the form task name  format specification argumentlist  the format specification uses the symbol  to specify the radix of the numbers that are displayed and may have string enclosed in quotes   the base may be binary decimal hexadecimal or octal identified with the symbols   and respectively    and are valid too  for example the statement display  b  a  specifies the display of in decimal and of and in binary note that there are no commas in the format specification that the format specification and argument list section   hdl models of combinational circuits   are separated by comma and that the argument list has commas between the variables an example that specifies string enclosed in quotes may look like the statement display  time  a  time b  and will produce the display time    where time    and  are part of the string to be displayed the format specifiers   and specify the base for time and respectively in displaying time values it is better to use the format  instead of this provides display of the significant digits without the leading spaces that will include  will display about  leading spaces because time is calculated as  bit number  an example of stimulus module is shown in hdl example   the circuit to be tested is the two to one line multiplexer described in example   the module mux df has no ports the inputs for the mux are declared with reg keyword and the outputs with wire keyword the mux is instantiated with the local variables the initial block specifies sequence of binary values to be applied during the simulation the output response is checked with the monitor system task every time variable in its argument changes value the simulator displays the inputs output and time the result of the simulation is listed under the simulation log in the example

functional verification we study the circuit logical operation independently of timing considerations this can be done by deriving the truth table of the combinational circuit in timing verification we study the circuits operation by including the effect of delays through the gates this can be done by observing the waveforms at the outputs of the gates when they respond to given input an example of circuit with gate delays was presented in section   in hdl example   we next show an hdl example that produces the truth table of combinational circuit monitor system task displays the output caused by the given stimulus commented alternative statement having display task would create header that could be used with monitor statement to eliminate the repetition of names on each line of

held devices cell phones navigation receivers personal computers digital cameras personal media players and virtually all electronic consumer products have the ability to send receive store retrieve and process information represented in binary format the technology enabling and supporting these devices is critically dependent on electronic components that can store information e  have memory this chapter examines the operation and control of these devices and their use in circuits and enables you to better understand what is happening in these devices when you interact with them the digital circuits considered thus far have been combinationaltheir output depends only and immediately on their inputsthey have no memory e  dependence on past values of their inputs sequential circuits however act as storage elements and have memory they can store retain and then retrieve information when needed at later time our treatment will distinguish sequential logic from combinational logic   sequential circuits block diagram of sequential circuit is shown in fig    it consists of combinational circuit to which storage elements are connected to form feedback path the storage elements are devices capable of storing binary information the binary information stored in these elements at any given time defines the state of the sequential circuit at that time the sequential circuit receives binary information from external inputs that together with the present state of the storage elements determine the binary value of the outputs these external inputs also determine the condition for changing the state   section   sequential circuits   inputs outputs combinational memory circuit elements figure   block diagram of sequential circuit in the storage elements the block diagram demonstrates that the outputs in sequential circuit are function not only of the inputs but also of the present state of the storage elements the next state of the storage elements is also function of external inputs and the present state thus sequential circuit is specified by time sequence of inputs outputs and internal states in contrast the outputs of combinational logic depend only on the present values of the inputs there are two main types of sequential circuits and their classification is function of the timing of their signals synchronous sequential circuit is system whose behavior can be defined from the knowledge of its signals at discrete instants of time the behavior of an asynchronous sequential circuit depends upon the input signals at any instant of time and the order in which the inputs change the storage elements commonly used in asynchronous sequential circuits are time delay devices the storage capability of time delay device varies with the time it takes for the signal to propagate through the device in practice the internal propagation delay of logic gates is of sufficient duration to produce the needed delay so that actual delay units may not be necessary in gate type asynchronous systems the storage elements consist of logic gates whose propagation delay provides the required storage thus an asynchronous sequential circuit may be regarded as combinational circuit with feedback because of the feedback among logic gates an asynchronous sequential circuit may become unstable at times the instability problem imposes many difficulties on the designer these circuits will not be covered in this text synchronous sequential circuit employs signals that affect the storage elements at only discrete instants of time synchronization is achieved by timing device called clock generator which provides clock signal having the form of periodic train of clock pulses the clock signal is commonly denoted by the identifiers clock and clk the clock pulses are distributed throughout the system in such way that storage elements are affected only with the arrival of each pulse in practice the clock pulses determine when computational activity will occur within the circuit and other signals external inputs and otherwise determine what changes will take place affecting the storage elements and the outputs for example circuit that is to add and store two binary numbers would compute their sum from the values of the numbers and store the sum at the occurrence of clock pulse synchronous sequential circuits that use clock pulses to control storage elements are called clocked sequential circuits and are the type most frequently encountered in practice they are called synchronous circuits because the activity within the circuit and the resulting updating of stored values is synchronized to the occurrence of inputs outputs combinational circuit flip flops clock pulses block diagram timing diagram of clock pulses figure   synchronous clocked sequential circuit clock pulses the design of synchronous circuits is feasible because they seldom manifest instability problems and their timing is easily broken down into independent discrete steps each of which can be considered separately the storage elements memory used in clocked sequential circuits are called flipflops flip flop is binary storage device capable of storing one bit of information in stable state the output of flip flop is either  or  sequential circuit may use many flip flops to store as many bits as necessary the block diagram of synchronous clocked sequential circuit is shown in fig    the outputs are formed by combinational logic function of the inputs to the circuit or the values stored in the flip flops or both  the value that is stored in flip flop when the clock pulse occurs is also determined by the inputs to the circuit or the values presently stored in the flip flop or both  the new value is stored e  the flip flop is updated when pulse of the clock signal occurs prior to the occurrence of the clock pulse the combinational logic forming the next value of the flip flop must have reached stable value consequently the speed at which the combinational logic circuits operate is critical if the clock synchronizing pulses arrive at regular interval as shown in the timing diagram in fig    the combinational logic must respond to change in the state of the flip flop in time to be updated before the next pulse arrives propagation delays play an important role in determining the minimum interval between clock pulses that will allow the circuit to operate correctly change in state of the flip flops is initiated only by clock pulse transitionfor example when the value of the clock signals changes from  to  when clock pulse is not active the feedback loop between the value stored in the flip flop and the value formed at the input to the flip flop is effectively broken because the flipflop outputs cannot change even if the outputs of the combinational circuit driving their inputs change in value thus the transition from one state to the next occurs only at predetermined intervals dictated by the clock pulses   section   storage elements latches   storage elements latches storage element in digital circuit can maintain binary state indefinitely as long as power is delivered to the circuit  until directed by an input signal to switch states the major differences among various types of storage elements are in the number of inputs they possess and in the manner in which the inputs affect the binary state storage elements that operate with signal levels rather than signal transitions are referred to as latches those controlled by clock transition are flip flops latches are said to be level sensitive devices flip flops are edge sensitive devices the two types of storage elements are related because latches are the basic circuits from which all flip flops are constructed although latches are useful for storing binary information and for the design of asynchronous sequential circuits they are not practical for use as storage elements in synchronous sequential circuits because they are the building blocks of flip flops however we will consider the fundamental storage mechanism used in latches before considering flip flops in the next section sr latch the sr latch is circuit with two cross coupled nor gates or two cross coupled nand gates and two inputs labeled for set and for reset the sr latch constructed with two cross coupled nor gates is shown in fig   the latch has two useful states when output   and   the latch is said to be in the set state when   and   it is in the reset state outputs and are normally the complement of each other however when both inputs are equal to  at the same time condition in which both outputs are equal to  rather than be mutually complementary occurs if both inputs are then switched to  simultaneously the device will enter an unpredictable or undefined state or metastable state consequently in practical applications setting both inputs to  is forbidden under normal conditions both inputs of the latch remain at  unless the state has to be changed the application of momentary  to the input causes the latch to go to the set state the input must go back to  before any other changes take place in order to avoid the occurrence of an undefined next state that results from the forbidden input condition as shown in the function table of fig    two input conditions cause the circuit to be in   reset r q        after           after    set      forbidden  logic diagram function table figure   sr latch with nor gates   set s q         after    reset        after    logic diagram     forbidden  function table figure   sr latch with nand gates the set state the first condition     is the action that must be taken by input to bring the circuit to the set state removing the active input from leaves the circuit in the same state after both inputs return to  it is then possible to shift to the reset state by momentary applying  to the input the  can then be removed from whereupon the circuit remains in the reset state thus when both inputs and are equal to  the latch can be in either the set or the reset state depending on which input was most recently  if  is applied to both the and inputs of the latch both outputs go to  this action produces an undefined next state because the state that results from the input transitions depends on the order in which they return to  it also violates the requirement that outputs be the complement of each other in normal operation this condition is avoided by making sure that are not applied to both inputs simultaneously the sr latch with two cross coupled nand gates is shown in fig    it operates with both inputs normally at  unless the state of the latch has to be changed the application of  to the input causes output to go to  putting the latch in the set state when the input goes back to  the circuit remains in the set state after both inputs go back to  we are allowed to change the state of the latch by placing  in the input this action causes the circuit to go to the reset state and stay there even after both inputs return to  the condition that is forbidden for the nand latch is both inputs being equal to  at the same time an input combination that should be avoided in comparing the nand with the nor latch note that the input signals for the nand require the complement of those values used for the nor latch because the nand latch requires  signal to change its state it is sometimes referred to as an sr latch the primes or sometimes bars over the letters designate the fact that the inputs must be in their complement form to activate the circuit the operation of the basic sr latch can be modified by providing an additional input signal that determines controls when the state of the latch can be changed by determining whether and or and can affect the circuit an sr latch with control input is shown in fig    it consists of the basic sr latch and two additional nand gates the control input en acts as an enable signal for the other two inputs the outputs of the nand gates stay at the logic  level as long as the enable signal remains at  this is the quiescent condition for the sr latch when the enable input goes to  information from the or input is allowed to affect the latch the set state is reached with     and en   section   storage elements latches   q en r next state of en  x no change

diagram an indeterminate condition occurs when all three inputs are equal to  this condition places on both inputs of the basic sr latch which puts it in the undefined state when the enable input goes back to  one cannot conclusively determine the next state because it depends on whether the or input goes to  first this indeterminate condition makes this circuit difficult to manage and it is seldom used in practice nevertheless the sr latch is an important circuit because other useful latches and flip flops are constructed from it latch transparent latch one way to eliminate the undesirable condition of the indeterminate state in the sr latch is to ensure that inputs and are never equal to  at the same time this is done in the latch shown in fig    this latch has only two inputs data and

of the input is sampled when en   if   the output goes to  placing the circuit in the set state if   output goes to  placing the circuit in the reset state the latch receives that designation from its ability to hold data in its internal storage it is suited for use as temporary storage for binary information between unit and its environment the binary information present at the data input of the latch is transferred to the output when the enable input is asserted the output follows changes in the data input as long as the enable input is asserted this situation provides path from input to the output and for this reason the circuit is often called transparent latch when the enable input signal is de asserted the binary information that was present at the data input at the time the transition occurred is retained e  stored at the output until the enable input is asserted again note that an inverter could be placed at the enable input then depending on the physical circuit the external enabling signal will be value of  active low or  active high  the graphic symbols for the various latches are shown in fig   latch is designated by rectangular block with inputs on the left and outputs on the right one output designates the normal output and the other with the bubble designation designates the complement output the graphic symbol for the sr latch has inputs and indicated inside the block in the case of nand gate latch bubbles are added to the inputs to indicate that setting and resetting occur with logic  signal the graphic symbol for the latch has inputs and en indicated inside the block   storage elements flip flops the state of latch or flip flop is switched by change in the control input this momentary change is called trigger and the transition it causes is said to trigger the flip flop the latch with pulses in its control input is essentially flip flop that is triggered every time the pulse goes to the logic  level as long as the pulse input remains at this level any changes in the data input will change the output and the state of the latch section   storage elements flip flops   as seen from the block diagram of fig    sequential circuit has feedback path from the outputs of the flip flops to the input of the combinational circuit consequently the inputs of the flip flops are derived in part from the outputs of the same and other flip flops when latches are used for the storage elements serious difficulty arises the state transitions of the latches start as soon as the clock pulse changes to the logic  level the new state of latch appears at the output while the pulse is still active this output is connected to the inputs of the latches through the combinational circuit if the inputs applied to the latches change while the clock pulse is still at the logic  level the latches will respond to new values and new output state may occur the result is an unpredictable situation since the state of the latches may keep changing for as long as the clock pulse stays at the active level because of this unreliable operation the output of latch cannot be applied directly or through combinational logic to the input of the same or another latch when all the latches are triggered by common clock source flip flop circuits are constructed in such way as to make them operate properly when they are part of sequential circuit that employs common clock the problem with the latch is that it responds to change in the level of clock pulse as shown in fig    positive level response in the enable input allows changes in the output when the input changes while the clock pulse stays at logic  the key to the proper operation of flip flop is to trigger it only during signal transition this can be accomplished by eliminating the feedback path that is inherent in the operation of the sequential circuit using latches clock pulse goes through two transitions from  to  and the return from  to  as shown in fig    the positive transition is defined as the positive edge and the negative transition as the negative edge there are two ways that latch can be modified to form flip flop one way is to employ two latches in special configuration that isolates the output of the flip flop and prevents it from being affected while the input to the flip flop is changing another way is to produce flip flop that response to positive level positive edge response negative edge response figure   clock response in latch and flip flop triggers only during signal transition from  to  or from  to  of the synchronizing signal clock and is disabled during the rest of the clock pulse we will now proceed to show the implementation of both types of flip flops edge triggered flip flop the construction of d flip flop with two latches and an inverter is shown in fig    the first latch is called the master and the second the slave the circuit samples the input and changes its output only at the negative edge of the synchronizing or controlling clock designated as clk  when the clock is  the output of the inverter is  the slave latch is enabled and its output is equal to the master output the master latch is disabled because clk   when the input pulse changes to the logic  level the data from the external input are transferred to the master the slave however is disabled as long as the clock remains at the  level because its enable input is equal to  any change in the input changes the master output at but cannot affect the slave output when the clock pulse returns to  the master is disabled and is isolated from the input at the same time the slave is enabled and the value of is transferred to the output of the flip flop at thus change in the output of the flip flop can be triggered only by and during the transition of the clock from  to  the behavior of the mastercslave flip flop just described dictates that   the output may change only once   change in the output is triggered by the negative edge of the clock and   the change may occur only during the clocks negative level the value that is produced at the output of the flip flop is the value that was stored in the master stage immediately before the negative edge occurred it is also possible to design the circuit so that the flip flop output changes on the positive edge of the clock this happens in flip flop that has an additional inverter between the clk terminal and the junction between the other inverter and input en of the master latch such flip flop is triggered with negative pulse so that the negative edge of the clock affects the master and the positive edge affects the slave and the output terminal another construction of an edge triggered flip flop uses three sr latches as shown in fig    two latches respond to the external data and clk clock inputs the third latch provides the outputs for the flip flop the and inputs of the output latch d d d latch latch master  slave en en clk figure   mastercslave flip flop section   storage elements flip flops   q clk q figure   type positive edge triggered flip flop are maintained at the logic  level when clk   this causes the output to remain in its present state input may be equal to  or  if   when clk becomes  changes to  this causes the flip flop to go to the reset state making   if there is change in the input while clk   terminal remains at  because is  thus the flip flop is locked out and is unresponsive to further changes in the input when the clock returns to  goes to  placing the output latch in the quiescent condition without changing the output similarly if   when clk goes from  to  changes to  this causes the circuit to go to the set state making   any change in while clk   does not affect the output in sum when the input clock in the positive edge triggered flip flop makes positive transition the value of is transferred to a negative transition of the clock e  from  to  does not affect the output nor is the output affected by changes in when clk is in the steady logic  level or the logic  level hence this type of flip flop responds to the transition from  to  and nothing else the timing of the response of flip flop to input data and to the clock must be taken into consideration when one is using edge triggered flip flops there is minimum time called the setup time during which the input must be maintained at constant value prior to the occurrence of the clock transition similarly there is minimum time called the hold time during which the input must not change after the application of the positive transition of the clock the propagation delay time of the flip flop is defined as the interval between the trigger edge and the stabilization of the output to new state these and other parameters are specified in manufacturers data books for specific logic families d clk clk positive edge negative edge figure   graphic symbol for edge triggered flip flop the graphic symbol for the edge triggered flip flop is shown in fig    it is similar to the symbol used for the latch except for the arrowhead like symbol in front of the letter clk designating dynamic input the dynamic indicator   denotes the fact that the flip flop responds to the edge transition of the clock bubble outside the block adjacent to the dynamic indicator designates negative edge for triggering the circuit the absence of bubble designates positive edge response other flip flops very large scale integration circuits contain several thousands of gates within one package circuits are constructed by interconnecting the various gates to provide digital system each flip flop is constructed from an interconnection of gates the most economical and efficient flip flop constructed in this manner is the edge triggered flipflop because it requires the smallest number of gates other types of flip flops can be constructed by using the flip flop and external logic two flip flops less widely used in the design of digital systems are the jk and flip flops there are three operations that can be performed with flip flop set it to  reset it to  or complement its output with only single input the flip flop can set or reset the output depending on the value of the input immediately before the clock transition synchronized by clock signal the jk flip flop has two inputs and performs all three operations the circuit diagram of jk flip flop constructed with d flip flop and gates is shown in fig     the input sets the flip flop to  the input resets it to  and when both inputs are enabled the output is complemented this can be verified by investigating the circuit applied to the input  jq  kq when   and       so the next clock edge sets the output to  when   and     so the next clock edge resets the output to  when both    and  the next clock edge complements the output when both    and  the clock edge leaves the output unchanged the graphic symbol for the jk flip flop is shown in fig     it is similar to the graphic symbol of the flip flop except that now the inputs are marked and the toggle flip flop is complementing flip flop and can be obtained from jk flip flop when inputs and are tied together this is shown in fig

      clock edge does not change the output when       clock edge complements the output the complementing flip flop is useful for designing binary counters the flip flop can be constructed with d

this flip flop has t symbol in the input characteristic tables characteristic table defines the logical properties of flip flop by describing its operation in tabular form the characteristic tables of

to the application of clock edge  t   is the next state one clock period later note that the clock edge input is not included in the characteristic table but is implied to occur between times and   thus t denotes the state of the flip flop immediately before the clock edge and t   denotes the state that results from the clock transition the characteristic table for the jk flip flop shows that the next state is equal to the present state when inputs and are both equal to  this condition can be expressed as t    t  indicating that the clock produces no change of state when   and   the clock resets the flip flop and t      with   and   the flip flop sets and t      when both and are equal to  the next state changes to the complement of the present state transition that can be expressed as t    t  the next state of d flip flop is dependent only on the input and is independent of the present state this can be expressed as t    it means that the next state value is equal to the value of note that the flip flop does not have no change condition such condition can be accomplished either by disabling the clock or by operating the clock by having the output of the flip flop connected into the input either method effectively circulates the output of the flip flop when the state of the flip flop must remain unchanged the characteristic table of the flip flop has only two conditions when   the clock edge does not change the state when   the clock edge complements the state of the flip flop section   storage elements flip flops   characteristic equations the logical properties of flip flop as described in the characteristic table can be expressed algebraically with characteristic equation for the flip flop we have the characteristic equation t    which states that the next state of the output will be equal to the value of input in the present state the characteristic equation for the jk flip flop can be derived from the characteristic table or from the circuit of fig    we obtain t    jq  kq where is the value of the flip flop output prior to the application of clock edge the characteristic equation for the flip flop is obtained from the circuit of fig    t      tq  tq direct inputs some flip flops have asynchronous inputs that are used to force the flip flop to particular state independently of the clock the input that sets the flip flop to  is called preset or direct set the input that clears the flip flop to  is called clear or direct reset when power is turned on in digital system the state of the flip flops is unknown the direct inputs are useful for bringing all flip flops in the system to known starting state prior to the clocked operation positive edge triggered flip flop with active low asynchronous reset is shown in fig    the circuit diagram is the same as the one in fig    except for the additional reset input connections to three nand gates when the reset input is  it forces output to stay at  which in turn clears output to  thus resetting the flip flop two other connections from the reset input ensure that the input of the third sr latch stays at logic  while the reset input is at  regardless of the values of and clk the graphic symbol for the flip flop with direct reset has an additional input marked with the bubble along the input indicates that the reset is active at the logic  level flip flops with direct set use the symbol for the asynchronous set input the function table specifies the operation of the circuit when   the output is reset to  this state is independent of the values of or clk normal clock

from the inputs the outputs and the state of its flip flops the outputs and the next state are both function of the inputs and the present state the analysis of sequential circuit consists of obtaining table or diagram for the time sequence of inputs outputs and internal states it is also possible section   analysis of clocked sequential circuits   to write boolean expressions that describe the behavior of the sequential circuit these expressions must include the necessary time sequence either directly or indirectly logic diagram is recognized as clocked sequential circuit if it includes flip flops with clock inputs the flip flops may be of any type and the logic diagram may or may not include combinational logic gates in this section we introduce an algebraic representation for specifying the next state condition in terms of the present state and inputs state table and state diagram are then presented to describe the behavior of the sequential circuit another algebraic representation is introduced for specifying the logic diagram of sequential circuits examples are used to illustrate the various procedures state equations the behavior of clocked sequential circuit can be described algebraically by means of state equations state equation also called transition equation specifies the next state as function of the present state and inputs consider the sequential circuit shown in fig    we will later show that it acts as  detector by asserting its output when x d clk y b clk clock figure   example of sequential circuit  is detected in stream of it consists of two flip flops and an input and an output since the input of flip flop determines the value of the next state e  the state reached after the clock transition  it is possible to write set of state equations for the circuit t    t t  t t t    t t state equation is an algebraic expression that specifies the condition for flip flop state transition the left side of the equation with    denotes the next state of the flip flop one clock edge later the right side of the equation is boolean expression that specifies the present state and input conditions that make the next state equal to  since all the variables in the boolean expressions are function of the present state we can omit the designation after each variable for convenience and can express the state equations in the more compact form t   ax  bx t   ax the boolean expressions for the state equations can be derived directly from the gates that form the combinational circuit part of the sequential circuit since the values of the combinational circuit determine the next state similarly the present state value of the output can be expressed algebraically as t   t  t t by removing the symbol for the present state we obtain the output boolean equation   x state table the time sequence of inputs outputs and flip flop states can be enumerated in state table sometimes called transition table  the state table for the circuit of fig    is shown in table   the table consists of four sections labeled present state input next state and output the present state section shows the states of flip flops and at any given time the input section gives value of for each possible present state the next state section shows the states of the flip flops one clock cycle later at time   the output section gives the value of at time for each present state and input condition the derivation of state table requires listing all possible binary combinations of present states and inputs in this case we have eight binary combinations from   to   the next state values are then determined from the logic diagram or from the state equations the next state of flip flop must satisfy the state equation t    ax  bx section   analysis of clocked

table under column has three where the present state of and input are both equal to  or the present state of and input are both equal to  similarly the next state of flip flop is derived from the state equation t    ax and is equal to  when the present state of is  and input is equal to  the output column is derived from the output equation  ax  bx the state table of sequential circuit with type flip flops is obtained by the same procedure outlined in the previous example in general sequential circuit with flipflops and inputs needs n rows in the state table the binary numbers from  through n  are listed under the present state and input columns the next state section has columns one for each flip flop the binary values for the next state are derived directly from the state equations the output section has as many columns as there are output variables its binary value is derived from the circuit or from the boolean function in the same manner as in truth table it is sometimes convenient to express the state table in slightly different form having only three sections present state next state and output the input conditions are enumerated under the next state and output sections the state table of table   is repeated in table   in this second form for each present state there are two possible next states and outputs depending on the value of the input one form may be preferable to the other depending on the application state diagram the information available in state table can be represented graphically in the form of state diagram in this type of diagram state is represented by circle and the clock triggered transitions between states are indicated by directed lines connecting table   second form of the state table present next state output state

state diagram provides the same information as the state table and is obtained directly from table   or table   the binary number inside each circle identifies the state of the flip flops the directed lines are labeled with two binary numbers separated by slash the input value during the present state is labeled first and the number after the slash gives the output during the present state with the given input  it is important to remember that the bit value listed for the output along the directed line occurs during the present state and with the indicated input and has nothing to do with the transition to the next state  for example the directed line from state  to  is labeled   meaning that when the sequential circuit is in the present state  and the input is  the output is  after the next clock cycle the circuit goes to the next state   if the input changes to  then the output becomes  but if the input remains at  the output stays at  this information is obtained from the state diagram along the two directed lines emanating from the circle with state   directed line connecting circle with itself indicates that no change of state occurs the steps presented in this example are summarized below circuit diagram equations state table state diagram section   analysis of clocked sequential circuits   this sequence of steps begins with structural representation of the circuit and proceeds to an abstract representation of its behavior an hdl model can be in the form of gate level description or in the form of behavioral description it is important to note that gate level approach requires that the designer understands how to select and connect gates and flip flops to form circuit having particular behavior that understanding comes with experience on the other hand an approach based on behavioral modeling does not require the designer to know how to invent schematicthe designer needs only to know how to describe behavior using the constructs of the hdl because the circuit is produced automatically by synthesis tool therefore one does not have to accumulate years of experience in order to become productive designer of digital circuits nor does one have to acquire an extensive background in electrical engineering there is no difference between state table and state diagram except in the manner of representation the state table is easier to derive from given logic diagram and the state equation the state diagram follows directly from the state table the state diagram gives pictorial view of state transitions and is the form more suitable for human interpretation of the circuits operation for example the state diagram of fig    clearly shows that starting from state   the output is  as long as the input stays at  the first  input after string of gives an output of  and transfers the circuit back to the initial state   the machine represented by this state diagram acts to detect zero in the bit stream of data it corresponds to the behavior of the circuit in fig    other circuits that detect zero in stream of data may have simpler circuit diagram and state diagram flip flop input equations the logic diagram of sequential circuit consists of flip flops and gates the interconnections among the gates form combinational circuit and may be specified algebraically with boolean expressions the knowledge of the type of flip flops and list of the boolean expressions of the combinational circuit provide the information needed to draw the logic diagram of the sequential circuit the part of the combinational circuit that generates external outputs is described algebraically by set of boolean functions called output equations the part of the circuit that generates the inputs to flip flops is described algebraically by set of boolean functions called flip flop input equations or sometimes excitation equations we will adopt the convention of using the flip flop input symbol to denote the input equation variable and subscript to designate the name of the flip flop output for example the following input equation specifies an or gate with inputs and connected to the input of flip flop whose output is labeled with the symbol dq   the sequential circuit of fig    consists of two flip flops and an input and an output the logic diagram of the circuit can be expressed algebraically with two flip flop input equations and an output equation da  ax  bx db  ax   x the three equations provide the necessary information for drawing the logic diagram of the sequential circuit the symbol da specifies d flip flop labeled db specifies second flip flop labeled the boolean expressions associated with these two variables and the expression for output specify the combinational circuit part of the sequential circuit the flip flop input equations constitute convenient algebraic form for specifying the logic diagram of sequential circuit they imply the type of flip flop from the letter symbol and they fully specify the combinational circuit that drives the flip flops note that the expression for the input equation for d flip flop is identical to the expression for the corresponding state equation this is because of the characteristic equation that equates the next state to the value of the input t    dq analysis with flip flops we will summarize the procedure for analyzing clocked sequential circuit with flipflops by means of simple example the circuit we want to analyze is described by the input equation da    the da symbol implies d flip flop with output the and variables are the inputs to the circuit no output equations are given which implies that the output comes from the output of the flip flop the logic diagram is obtained from the input equation and is drawn in fig     the state table has one

sequential circuit with two jk flip flops and and one input as shown in fig    the circuit has no outputs therefore the state table does not need an output column  the outputs of the flip flops may be considered as the outputs in this case  the circuit can be specified by the flip flop input equations ja  ka  bx jb  kb  ax  ax  x the state table of the sequential circuit is shown in table   the

the flip flop characteristic equation to obtain the state equations   use the corresponding state equations to determine the next state values in the state table the input equations for the two jk flip flops of fig    were listed couple of paragraphs ago the characteristic equations for the flip flops are obtained by substituting or for the name of the flip flop instead of a    ja  ka t    jb

provides the bit values for the column headed next state for in the state table note that the columns in table   headed flip flop inputs are not needed when state equations are used the state diagram of the sequential circuit is shown in fig    note that since the circuit has no outputs the directed lines out of the circles are marked with one binary number only to designate the value of input analysis with flip flops the analysis of sequential circuit with flip flops follows the same procedure outlined for jk flip flops the next state values in the state table can be obtained by using either     s           figure   state diagram of the circuit of fig    the characteristic table listed in table   or the characteristic equation t      tq  tq now consider the sequential circuit shown

combinational register combinational moore type logic logic clock figure   block diagrams of mealy and moore state machines is generated in the mealy model the output is function of both the present state and the input in the moore model the output is function of only the present state circuit may have both types of outputs the two models of sequential circuit are commonly referred to as finite state machine abbreviated fsm the mealy model of sequential circuit is referred to as mealy fsm or mealy machine the moore model is referred to as moore fsm or moore machine the circuit presented previously in fig    is an example of mealy machine output is function of both input and the present state of and the corresponding state diagram in fig    shows both the input and output values separated by slash along the directed lines between the states an example of moore model is given in fig    here the output is function of the present state only the corresponding state diagram in fig    has only inputs marked along the directed lines the outputs are the flip flop states marked inside the circles another example of moore model is the sequential circuit of fig    the output depends only on flip flop values and that makes it function of the present state only the input value in the state diagram is labeled along the directed line but the output value is indicated inside the circle together with the present state in moore model the outputs of the sequential circuit are synchronized with the clock because they depend only on flip flop outputs that are synchronized with the clock in mealy model the outputs may change if the inputs change during the clock section   synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits   cycle moreover the outputs may have momentary false values because of the delay encountered from the time that the inputs change and the time that the flip flop outputs change in order to synchronize mealy type circuit the inputs of the sequential circuit must be synchronized with the clock and the outputs must be sampled immediately before the clock edge the inputs are changed at the inactive edge of the clock to ensure that the inputs to the flip flops stabilize before the active edge of the clock occurs thus the output of the mealy machine is the value that is present immediately before the active edge of the clock   synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits the verilog hdl was introduced in section   combinational circuits were described in section    and behavioral modeling with verilog was introduced in that section as well behavioral models are abstract representations of the functionality of digital hardware that is they describe how circuit behaves but dont specify the internal details of the circuit historically the abstraction has been described by truth tables state tables and state diagrams an hdl describes the functionality differently by language constructs that represent the operations of registers in machine this representation has added value e  it is important for you to know how to use because it can be simulated to produce waveforms demonstrating the behavior of the machine behavioral modeling there are two kinds of abstract behaviors in the verilog hdl behavior declared by the keyword initial is called single pass behavior and specifies single statement or block statement e  list of statements enclosed by either begin    end or fork    join keyword pair  single pass behavior expires after the associated statement executes in practice designers use single pass behavior primarily to prescribe stimulus signals in test benchnever to model the behavior of circuitbecause synthesis tools do not accept descriptions that use the initial statement the always keyword declares cyclic behavior both types of behaviors begin executing when the simulator launches at time   the initial behavior expires after its statement executes the always behavior executes and reexecutes indefinitely until the simulation is stopped module may contain an arbitrary number of initial or always behavioral statements they execute concurrently with respect to each other starting at time  and may interact through common variables heres word description of how an always statement works for simple model of d flip flop whenever the rising edge of the clock occurs if the reset input is asserted the output gets  otherwise the output gets the value of the input the execution of statements triggered by the clock is repeated until the simulation ends well see shortly how to write this description in verilog an initial behavioral statement executes only once it begins its execution at the start of simulation and expires after all of its statements have completed execution as mentioned at the end of section    the initial statement is useful for generating input signals to simulate design in simulating sequential circuit it is necessary to generate clock source for triggering the flip flops the following are two possible ways to provide free running clock that operates for specified number of cycles initial initial begin begin clock    clock    repeat   end   clock  clock end initial   finish always   clock  clock in the first version the initial block contains two statements enclosed within the begin and end keywords the first statement sets clock to  at time   the second statement specifies loop that reexecutes  times to wait  time units and then complement the value of clock this produces  clock cycles each with cycle time of  time units in the second version the first initial behavior has single statement that sets clock to  at time   and it then expires causes no further simulation activity  the second singlepass behavior declares stopwatch for the simulation the system task finish causes the simulation to terminate unconditionally after   time units have elapsed because this behavior has only one statement associated with it there is no need to write the begin    end keyword pair after  time units the always statement repeatedly complements clock providing clock generator having cycle time of  time units the three behavioral statements in the second example can be written in any order here is another way to describe free running clock initial begin clock   forever   clock  clock end this version with two statements in one block statement initializes the clock and then executes an indefinite loop forever in which the clock is complemented after delay of  time steps note that the single pass behavior never finishes executing and so does not expire another behavior would have to terminate the simulation the activity associated with either type of behavioral statement can be controlled by delay operator that waits for certain time or by an event control operator that waits for certain conditions to become true or for specified events changes in signals to occur time delays specified with the  delay control operator are commonly used in single pass behaviors the delay control operator suspends execution of statements until specified time has elapsed weve already seen examples of its use to specify signals in test bench another operator  is called the event control operator and is used to suspend activity until an event occurs an event can be an unconditional change in signal value g   or specified transition of signal value g   posedge clock  the general form of this type of statement is always  event control expression begin  procedural assignment statements that execute when the condition is met end section   synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits   the event control expression specifies the condition that must occur to launch execution of the procedural assignment statements the variables in the left hand side of the procedural statements must be of the reg data type and must be declared as such the right hand side can be any expression that produces value using verilog defined operators the event control expression also called the sensitivity list specifies the events that must occur to initiate execution of the procedural statements associated with the always block statements within the block execute sequentially from top to bottom after the last statement executes the behavior waits for the event control expression to be satisfied then the statements are executed again the sensitivity list can specify levelsensitive events edge sensitive events or combination of the two in practice designers do not make use of the third option because this third form is not one that synthesis tools are able to translate into physical hardware level sensitive events occur in combinational circuits and in latches for example the statement always  or or will initiate execution of the procedural statements in the associated always block if change occurs in b or in synchronous sequential circuits changes in flip flops occur only in response to transition of clock pulse the transition may be either positive edge or negative edge of the clock but not both verilog hdl takes care of these conditions by providing two keywords posedge and negedge for example the expression always  posedge clock or negedge reset   verilog   will initiate execution of the associated procedural statements only if the clock goes through positive transition or if reset goes through negative transition the   and   revisions to the verilog language allow comma separated list for the event control expression or sensitivity list  always  posedge clock negedge reset   verilog      procedural assignment is an assignment of logic value to variable within an initial or always statement this is in contrast to continuous assignment discussed in section   with dataflow modeling continuous assignment has an implicit levelsensitive sensitivity list consisting of all of the variables on the right hand side of its assignment statement the updating of continuous assignment is triggered whenever an event occurs in variable included on the right hand side of its expression in contrast procedural assignment is made only when an assignment statement is executed and assigns value to it within behavioral statement for example the clock signal in the preceding example was complemented only when the statement clock  clock executed the statement did not execute until  time units after the simulation began it is important to remember that variable having type reg remains unchanged until procedural assignment is made to give it new value there are two kinds of procedural assignments blocking and nonblocking the two are distinguished by the symbols that they use blocking assignments use the symbol   as the assignment operator and nonblocking assignments use    as the operator blocking assignment statements are executed sequentially in the order they are listed in block of statements nonblocking assignments are executed concurrently by evaluating the set of expressions on the right hand side of the list of statements they do not make assignments to their left hand sides until all of the expressions are evaluated the two types of assignments may be better understood by means of an illustration consider these two procedural blocking assignments  c    the first statement transfers the value of into the second statement increments the value of and transfers the new value to at the completion of the assignments contains the value of   now consider the two statements as nonblocking assignments  c    when the statements are executed the expressions on the right hand side are evaluated and stored in temporary location the value of is kept in one storage location and the value of   in another after all the expressions in the block are evaluated and stored the assignment to the targets on the left hand side is made in this case will contain the original value of plus  general rule is to use blocking assignments when sequential ordering is imperative and in cyclic behavior that is level sensitive e  in combinational logic  use nonblocking assignments when modeling concurrent execution g  edge sensitive behavior such as synchronous concurrent register transfers and when modeling latched behavior nonblocking assignments are imperative in dealing with register transfer level design as shown in chapter  they model the concurrent operations of physical hardware synchronized by common clock todays designers are expected to know what features of an hdl are useful in practical way and how to avoid features that are not following these rules for using the assignment operators will prevent conditions that lead synthesis tools astray and create mismatches between the behavior of model and the behavior of physical hardware that is produced by synthesis tool hdl models of flip flops and latches hdl examples   through   show verilog descriptions of various flip flops and d latch the latch is said to be transparent because it responds to change in data input with change in the output as long as the enable input is assertedviewing the output is the same as viewing the input the description of d latch is shown in hdl example   it has two inputs and enable and one output since is assigned value in behavior its type must be declared to be reg hardware latches respond to input signal levels so the two inputs are listed without edge qualifiers in the sensitivity list following the  symbol in the always statement in this model there is only one blocking procedural assignment statement and it specifies the transfer of input to output if enable section   synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits   is true logic   note that this statement is executed every time there is change in if enable is  d type flip flop is the simplest example of sequential machine hdl example   describes two positive edge flip flops in two modules the first responds only to the clock the second includes an asynchronous reset input output must be declared as reg data type in addition to being listed as an output this is because it is target output of procedural assignment statement the keyword posedge ensures that the transfer of input into is synchronized by the positive edge transition of clk change in at any other time does not change hdl example   latch   description of latch see fig    module

module dff output reg input clk rst  always  posedge clk negedge rst if  rst     same as if rst    else  endmodule the statement single or block associated with if boolean expression executes if the boolean expression is true the second module includes an asynchronous reset input in addition to the synchronous clock specific form of an if statement is used to describe such flip flop so that the model can be synthesized by software tool the event expression after the  symbol in the always statement may have any number of edge events either posedge or negedge for modeling hardware one of the events must be clock event the remaining events specify conditions under which asynchronous logic is to be executed the designer knows which signal is the clock but clock is not an identifier that software tools automatically recognize as the synchronizing signal of circuit the tool must be able to infer which signal is the clock so you need to write the description in way that enables the tool to infer the clock correctly the rules are simple to follow   each if or else if statement in the procedural assignment statements is to correspond to an asynchronous event   the last else statement corresponds to the clock event and   the asynchronous events are tested first there are two edge events in the second module of hdl example   the negedge rst reset event is asynchronous since it matches the if  rst statement as long as rst is  is cleared to  if clk has positive transition its effect is blocked only if rst   can the posedge clock event synchronously transfer into hardware always has reset signal it is strongly recommended that all models of edge sensitive behavior include reset or preset input signal otherwise the initial state of the flip flops of the sequential circuit cannot be determined sequential circuit cannot be tested with hdl simulation unless an initial state can be assigned with an input signal hdl example   describes the construction of t or jk

concatenating the bits of and the case expression  k  is evaluated and compared with the values in the list of statements that follows the first value that matches the true condition is executed since the concatenation of and produces two bit number it can be equal to       or   the first bit gives the value of and the second the value of the four possible conditions specify the value of the next

is presented in hdl example   for the zero detector machine described by the sequential circuit in fig    and its state diagram shown in fig    the input output clock and reset are declared in the usual manner the state of the flip flops is declared with identifiers state and next state these variables hold the values of the present state and the next value of the sequential circuit the states binary assignment is done with parameter statement  verilog allows constants to be defined in module by the keyword parameter  the four states through are assigned binary  through  the notation    is preferable to the alternative    the former uses only two bits to store the constant whereas the latter results in binary number with   or   bits because an unsized number is interpreted and sized as

concurrently and interact through common variables the first always statement resets the circuit to the initial state    and specifies the synchronous clocked operation the statement state  next state is synchronized to positive edge transition of the clock this means that any change in the value of next state in the second always block can affect the value of state only as result of posedge event of clock the second always block determines the value of the next state transition as function of the present state and input the value assigned to state by the nonblocking assignment is the value of next state immediately before the rising edge of clock notice how the multiway branch condition implements the state transitions specified by the annotated edges in the state diagram of fig    the third always block specifies the output as function of the present state and the input although this block is listed as separate behavior for clarity it could be combined with the second block note that the value of output out may change if the value of input in changes while the circuit is in any given state so lets summarize how the model describes the behavior of the machine at every rising edge of clock if reset is not asserted the state of the machine is updated by the first always block when state is updated by the first always block the change in state is detected by the sensitivity list mechanism of the second always block then the second always block updates the value of next state it will be used by the first always block at the next tick of the clock  the third always block also detects the change in state and updates the value of the output in addition the second and third always blocks detect changes in in and update next state and out accordingly the test bench provided with mealy zero detector provides some waveforms to stimulate the model producing the results shown in fig    notice how y out responds to changes in both the state and the input and has glitch transient logic value  we display both to state   and next state   to illustrate how changes in x in influence the value of next state and y out the mealy glitch in y out is due to the

mealy zero detector to value of  immediately before the clock and at the clock the state makes transition from  to  which is consistent with fig    the output is  in state immediately before the clock and changes to  as the state enters  the description of waveforms in the test bench uses the fork    join construct statements with the fork    join block execute in parallel so the time delays are relative to common reference of   the time at which the block begins execution  it is usually more convenient to use the fork    join block instead of the begin    end block in describing waveforms notice that the waveform of reset is triggered on the fly to demonstrate that the machine recovers from an unexpected asynchronous reset condition during any state how does our verilog model mealy zero detector correspond to hardware the first always block corresponds to d flip flop implementation of the state register in fig    the second always block is the combinational logic block describing the next state the third always block describes the output combinational logic of the zero detecting mealy machine the register operation of the state transition uses the nonblocking assignment operator    because the edge sensitive flip flops of sequential machine are updated concurrently by common clock the second and third always blocks describe combinational logic which is level sensitive so they use the blocking   assignment operator  fork    join block completes execution when the last executing statement within it completes its execution section   synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits   their sensitivity lists include both the state and the input because their logic must respond to change in either or both of them note the modeling style illustrated by mealy zero detector is commonly used by designers because it has close relationship to the state diagram of the machine that is being described notice that the reset signal is associated with the always block that synchronizes the state transitions in this example it is modeled as an active low reset because the reset condition is included in the description of the state transitions there is no need to include it in the combinational logic that specifies the next state and the output and the resulting description is less verbose simpler and more readable hdl example   presents the verilog behavioral model of the moore fsm shown in fig    and having the state diagram given in fig    the model illustrates an alternative style in which the state transitions of the machine are described by single clocked e  edge sensitive cyclic behavior e  by one always block the present state of the circuit is identified by the variable state and its transitions are triggered by the rising edge of the clock according to the conditions listed in the case statement the combinational logic that determines the next state is included in the nonblocking assignment to state in this example the output of the circuits is independent of the input and is taken directly from the outputs of the flip flops the two bit output out is specified with continuous assignment statement and is equal to the value of the present state vector figure   shows some simulation results for moore model fig    here are some important observations   the output depends on only the state   reset on the fly forces the state

udps  by dataflow statements continuous assignments  or by levelsensitive cyclic behaviors always blocks  sequential circuits are composed of combinational logic and flip flops and their hdl models use sequential udps and behavioral statements edge sensitive cyclic behaviors to describe the operation of flip flops one way to describe sequential circuit uses combination of dataflow and behavioral statements the flip flops are described with an always statement the combinational part can be described with assign statements and boolean equations the separate modules can be combined to form structural model by instantiation within module the structural description of moore type zero detector sequential circuit is shown in hdl example   we want to encourage the reader to consider alternative ways to model circuit so as point of comparison we first present moore model fig    verilog behavioral description of binary counter having the state diagram examined earlier shown in fig     this style of modeling follows directly from the state diagram an alternative style used in moore model str fig    represents the structure shown in fig     this style uses two modules the first describes the circuit of fig     the second describes the flip flop that will be used by the circuit we also show two ways to model the flip flop the first asserts that at every clock tick the value of the output of the flip flop toggles if the toggle input is asserted the second model describes the behavior of the toggle flip flop in terms of its characteristic equation the first style is attractive because it does not require the reader to remember the characteristic equation nonetheless the models are interchangeable and will synthesize to the same hardware circuit test bench module provides stimulus for verifying the functionality of the circuit the sequential circuit is two bit binary counter controlled by input in the output out is enabled when the count reaches binary   flip flops section   synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits   and are included as outputs in order to check their operation the flip flop input equations and the output equation are evaluated with continuous assignment assign statements having the corresponding boolean expressions the instantiated flip flops use ta and tb as defined by the input equations the second module describes the flip flop the reset input resets the flip flop to  with an active low signal the operation of the flip flop is specified by its characteristic equation t     the test bench includes both models of the machine the stimulus module provides common inputs to the circuits to simultaneously display their output responses the first initial block provides eight clock cycles with period of  ns the second initial block specifies toggling of input in that occurs at the negative edge transition of the clock the result of the simulation is shown in fig    the pair b goes through the binary sequence         and back to   the change in the count is triggered by positive edge of the clock provided that in   if in   the count does not change out is equal to  when both and are equal to  this verifies the

circuits starts from circuit diagram and culminates in state table or diagram the design synthesis of sequential circuit starts from set of specifications and culminates in logic diagram design procedures are presented in section   two sequential circuits may exhibit the same inputcoutput behavior but have different number of internal states in their state diagram the current section discusses certain properties of sequential circuits that may simplify design by reducing the number of gates and flip flops it uses in general reducing the number of flipflops reduces the cost of circuit state reduction the reduction in the number of flip flops in sequential circuit is referred to as the state reduction problem state reduction algorithms are concerned with procedures for reducing the number of states in state table while keeping the external inputcoutput requirements unchanged since flip flops produce states reduction in the number of states may or may not result in reduction in the number of flip flops an unpredictable effect in reducing the number of flip flops is that sometimes the equivalent circuit with fewer flip flops may require more combinational gates to realize its next state and output logic we will illustrate the state reduction procedure with an example we start with sequential circuit whose specification is given in the state diagram of fig    in our example only the inputcoutput sequences are important the internal states are used merely to provide the required sequences for that reason the states marked inside the circles are denoted                   d           figure   state diagram by letter symbols instead of their binary values this is in contrast to binary counter wherein the binary value sequence of the states themselves is taken as the outputs there are an infinite number of input sequences that may be applied to the circuit each results in unique output sequence as an example consider the input sequence       starting from the initial state each input of  or  produces an output of  or  and causes the circuit to go to the next state from the state diagram we obtain the output and state sequence for the given input sequence as follows with the circuit in initial state an input of  produces an output of  and the circuit remains in state with present state and an input of  the output is  and the next state is with present state and an input of  the output is  and the next state is continuing this process we find the complete sequence to be as follows state a c e f f a input            output            in each column we have the present state input value and output value the next state is written on top of the next column it is important to realize that in this circuit the states themselves are of secondary importance because we are interested only in output sequences caused by input sequences now let us assume that we have found sequential circuit whose state diagram has fewer than seven states and suppose we wish to compare this circuit with the circuit whose state diagram is given by fig    if identical input sequences are applied to the two circuits and identical outputs occur for all input sequences then the two circuits are said to be equivalent as far as the inputcoutput is concerned and one may be replaced by the other the problem of state reduction is to find ways of reducing the number of states in sequential circuit without altering the inputcoutput relationships section   state reduction and assignment   we now proceed to reduce the number of states for this example first we need the state table it is more convenient to apply procedures for state reduction with the use of table rather than diagram the state table of the circuit is listed in table   and is obtained directly from the state diagram the following algorithm for the state reduction of completely specified state table is given here without proof two states are said to be equivalent if for each member of the set of inputs they give exactly the same output and send the circuit either to the same state or to an equivalent state when two states are equivalent one of them can be removed without altering the inputcoutput relationships now apply this algorithm to table   going through the state table we look for two present states that go to the same next state and have the same output for both input combinations states and are two such states they both go to states and and have outputs of  and  for   and   respectively therefore states and are equivalent and one of these states can be removed the procedure of removing state and replacing it by its equivalent is demonstrated in table   the row with present state is removed and state is replaced by state each time it occurs in the columns headed next state present state now has next states and and outputs  and  for   and   respectively the same next states and outputs appear in the row with present state therefore states and are equivalent and state can be removed and replaced by the final reduced table is shown in table   the state diagram for the reduced table consists of only five states and is shown in fig    this state diagram satisfies the original inputcoutput specifications and will produce the required output sequence for any given input sequence the following list derived from the state diagram of fig    is for the input sequence used previously note that the same output sequence results although the state sequence is different  state a c e d d a input            output            table   next state

state table x x present state a   c d   e d   d   d   in fact this sequence is exactly the same as that obtained for fig    if we replace by and by checking each pair of states for equivalency can be done systematically by means of procedure that employs an implication table which consists of squares one for every suspected pair of possible equivalent states by judicious use of the table it is possible to determine all pairs of equivalent states in state table           b           figure   reduced state diagram section   state reduction and assignment   the sequential circuit of this example was reduced from seven to five states in general reducing the number of states in state table may result in circuit with less equipment however the fact that state table has been reduced to fewer states does not guarantee saving in the number of flip flops or the number of gates in actual practice designers may skip this step because target devices are rich in resources state assignment in order to design sequential circuit with physical components it is necessary to assign unique coded binary values to the states for circuit with states the codes must contain bits where m for example with three bits it is possible to assign codes to eight states denoted by binary numbers   through   if the state table of table   is used we must assign binary values to seven states the remaining state is unused if the state table of table   is used only five states need binary assignment and we are left with three unused states unused states are treated as dont care conditions during the design since dont care conditions usually help in obtaining simpler circuit it is more likely but not certain that the circuit with five states will require fewer combinational gates than the one with seven states the simplest way to code five states is to use the first five integers in binary counting order as shown in the first assignment of table   another similar assignment is the gray code shown in assignment  here only one bit in the code group changes when going from one number to the next this code makes it easier for the boolean functions to be placed in the map for simplification another possible assignment often used in the design of state machines to control data path units is the one hot assignment this configuration uses as many bits as there are states in the circuit at any given time only one bit is equal to  while all others are kept at  this type of assignment uses one flipflop per state which is not an issue for register rich field programmable gate arrays  see chapter   one hot encoding usually leads to simpler decoding logic for the next state and output one hot machines can be faster than machines with sequential binary encoding and the silicon area required by the extra flip flops can be offset by the area table   three possible binary state assignments assignment  assignment  assignment  state binary gray code one hot

off is not guaranteed so it must be evaluated for given design table   is the reduced state table with binary assignment  substituted for the letter symbols of the states different assignment will result in state table with different binary values for the states the binary form of the state table is used to derive the nextstate and output forming combinational logic part of the sequential circuit the complexity of the combinational circuit depends on the binary state assignment chosen sometimes the name transition table is used for state table with binary assignment this convention distinguishes it from state table with symbolic names for the states in this book we use the same name for both types of state tables   design procedure design procedures or methodologies specify hardware that will implement desired behavior the design effort for small circuits may be manual but industry relies on automated synthesis tools for designing massive integrated circuits the sequential building block used by synthesis tools is the flip flop together with additional logic it can implement the behavior of jk and flip flops in fact designers generally do not concern themselves with the type of flip flop rather their focus is on correctly describing the sequential functionality that is to be implemented by the synthesis tool here we will illustrate manual methods using jk and flip flops the design of clocked sequential circuit starts from set of specifications and culminates in logic diagram or list of boolean functions from which the logic diagram can be obtained in contrast to combinational circuit which is fully specified by truth table sequential circuit requires state table for its specification the first step in the design of sequential circuits is to obtain state table or an equivalent representation such as state diagram  synchronous sequential circuit is made up of flip flops and combinational gates the design of the circuit consists of choosing the flip flops and then finding combinational we will examine later another important representation of machines behaviorthe algorithmic state machine asm chart section   design procedure   gate structure that together with the flip flops produces circuit which fulfills the stated specifications the number of flip flops is determined from the number of states needed in the circuit and the choice of state assignment codes the combinational circuit is derived from the state table by evaluating the flip flop input equations and output equations in fact once the type and number of flip flops are determined the design process involves transformation from sequential circuit problem into combinational circuit problem in this way the techniques of combinational circuit design can be applied the procedure for designing synchronous sequential circuits can be summarized by list of recommended steps   from the word description and specifications of the desired operation derive state diagram for the circuit   reduce the number of states if necessary   assign binary values to the states   obtain the binary coded state table   choose the type of flip flops to be used   derive the simplified flip flop input equations and output equations   draw the logic diagram the word specification of the circuit behavior usually assumes that the reader is familiar with digital logic terminology it is necessary that the designer use intuition and experience to arrive at the correct interpretation of the circuit specifications because word descriptions may be incomplete and inexact once such specification has been set down and the state diagram obtained it is possible to use known synthesis procedures to complete the design although there are formal procedures for state reduction and assignment steps  and   they are seldom used by experienced designers steps  through  in the design can be implemented by exact algorithms and therefore can be automated the part of the design that follows well defined procedure is referred to as synthesis designers using logic synthesis tools software can follow simplified process that develops an hdl description directly from state diagram letting the synthesis tool determine the circuit elements and structure that implement the description the first step is critical part of the process because succeeding steps depend on it we will give one simple example to demonstrate how state diagram is obtained from word specification suppose we wish to design circuit that detects sequence of three or more consecutive in string of bits coming through an input line e  the input is serial bit stream  the state diagram for this type of circuit is shown in fig    it is derived by starting with state  the reset state if the input is  the circuit stays in  but if the input is  it goes to state to indicate that  was detected if the next input is  the change is to state to indicate the arrival of two consecutive but if the input is  the state goes back to  the third consecutive  sends the circuit to state  if more are detected the circuit stays in  any  input sends the circuit back to  in this way the circuit stays in as long as there are three or more consecutive received this is moore model sequential circuit since the output is  when the circuit is in state and is  otherwise             figure   state diagram for sequence detector synthesis using flip flops once the state diagram has been derived the rest of the design follows straightforward synthesis procedure in fact we can design the circuit by using an hdl description of the state diagram and the proper hdl synthesis tools to obtain synthesized netlist  the hdl description of the state diagram will be similar to hdl example   in section    to design the circuit by hand we need to assign binary codes to the states and list the state table this is done in table    the table is derived from the state diagram of fig    with sequential binary assignment we choose two flip flops to represent the four states and we label their outputs and there is one input and one output the characteristic equation of the flip flop is t    dq which means that the next state values in the state table specify the input condition for the flip flop the flip flop input equations table   state table for sequence detector present input next output state state a x b

the simplified equations are da  ax  bx db  ax  bx  ab the advantage of designing with flip flops is that the boolean equations describing the inputs to the flip flops can be obtained directly from the state table software tools automatically infer and select the type flip flop from properly written hdl model the schematic of the sequential circuit is drawn in fig    excitation tables the design of sequential circuit with flip flops other than the type is complicated by the fact that the input equations for the circuit must be derived indirectly from the state table when type flip flops are employed the input equations are obtained directly from the next state this is not the case for the jk and types of flip flops in order to determine the input equations for these flip flops it is necessary to derive functional relationship between the state table and the input equations the flip flop characteristic tables presented in table   provide the value of the next state when the inputs and the present state are known these tables are useful clk b clk clock figure   logic diagram of moore type sequence detector for analyzing sequential circuits and for defining the operation of the flip flops during the design process we usually know the transition from the present state to the next state and wish to find the flip flop input conditions that will cause the required transition for this reason we need table that lists the required inputs for given change of state such table is called an excitation table table   shows the excitation tables for the two flip flops jk and  each table has column for the present state t  column for the next state t    and column for each input to show how the required transition is achieved there are four possible transitions from the present state to the next state the required input conditions for each of the four transitions are derived from the information available in the characteristic table the symbol in the tables represents dont care condition which means that it does not matter whether the input is  or  the excitation table for the jk flip flop is shown in part  when both present state and next state are  the input must remain at  and the input can be either  or  similarly when both present state and next state are  the input must remain at  section   design procedure   table   flip flop excitation tables t t  k   t                          jk flip flop t flip flop while the input can be  or  if the flip flop is to have transition from the  state to the  state must be equal to  since the input sets the flip flop however input may be either  or  if   the   condition sets the flip flop as required if   and   the flip flop is complemented and goes from the  state to the  state as required therefore the input is marked with dont care condition for the  to  transition for transition from the  state to the  state we must have   since the input clears the flip flop however the input may be either  or  since   has no effect and   together with   complements the flip flop with resultant transition from the  state to the  state the excitation table for the flip flop is shown in part  from the characteristic table we find that when input   the state of the flip flop is complemented and when   the state of the flip flop remains unchanged therefore when the state of the flip flop must remain the same the requirement is that   when the state of the flip flop has to be complemented must equal  synthesis using jk flip flops the manual synthesis procedure for sequential circuits with jk flip flops is the same as with flip flops except that the input equations must be evaluated from the presentstate to the next state transition derived from the excitation table to illustrate the procedure we will synthesize the sequential circuit specified by table    in addition to having columns for the present state input and next state as in conventional state table the table shows the flip flop input conditions from which the input equations are derived the flip flop inputs are derived from the state table in conjunction with the excitation table for the jk flip flop for example in the first row of table    we have transition for flip flop from  in the present state to  in the next state in table    for the jk flip flop we find that transition of states from present state  to next state  requires that input be  and input be dont care so  and are entered in the first row under ja and ka respectively since the first row also shows transition for flip flop from  in the present state to  in the next state  and are inserted into the first row under jb and kb respectively the second row of the table shows transition for flip flop from  in the present state to  in the next state from the excitation table we find that transition from  to  requires that be  and be dont care so  and are copied into table   state table and jk flip flop inputs present input next flip flop inputs state

with the input conditions from the excitation table copied into the proper row of the particular flip flop being considered the flip flop inputs in table   specify the truth table for the input equations as function of present state present state and input the input equations are simplified in the maps of fig    the next state values are not used during the simplification bx bx a

logic diagram for sequential circuit with jk flip flops since the input equations are function of the present state and the input only note the advantage of using jk type flip flops when sequential circuits are designed manually the fact that there are so many dont care entries indicates that the combinational circuit for the input equations is likely to be simpler because dont care minterms usually help in obtaining simpler expressions if there are unused states in the state table there will be additional dont care conditions in the map nonetheless type flip flops are more amenable to an automated design flow the four input equations for the pair of jk flip flops are listed under the maps of fig    the logic diagram schematic of the sequential circuit is drawn in fig    synthesis using flip flops the procedure for synthesizing circuits using flip flops will be demonstrated by designing binary counter an bit binary counter consists of flip flops that can count in binary from  to  the state diagram of three bit counter is shown in fig    as                 figure   state diagram of three bit binary counter seen from the binary states indicated inside the circles the flip flop outputs repeat the binary count sequence with return to   after   the directed lines between circles are not marked with input and output values as in other state diagrams remember that state transitions in clocked sequential circuits are initiated by clock edge the flip flops remain in their present states if no clock is applied for that reason the clock does not appear explicitly as an input variable in state diagram or state table from this point of view the state diagram of counter does not have to show input and output values along the directed lines the only input to the circuit is the clock and the outputs are specified by the present state of the flip flops the next state of counter depends entirely on its present state and the state transition occurs every time the clock goes through transition table   is the state table for the three bit binary counter the three flip flops are symbolized by   and  binary counters are constructed most efficiently with flip flops because of their complement property the flip flop excitation for the inputs is derived from the excitation table of the flip flop and by inspection of the state transition of the present state to the next state as an illustration consider the flip flop input entries for row   the present state here is   and the next state is   which is the next count in the sequence comparing these two counts we note that goes from  to  so ta is marked with  because flip flop must not change when clock occurs also goes from  to  so ta is marked with  because this flip flop must be complemented in the next clock edge similarly goes from  to  indicating that it must be complemented so ta is marked with  the last row with present state   is compared with the first count   which is its next state going from all to all requires that all three flip flops be complemented the flip flop input equations are simplified in the maps of fig    note that ta has in all eight minterms because the least significant bit of the counter is complemented with each count boolean function that includes all minterms defines constant value of  the input equations listed under each map specify the

state machine type flip flop toggle flip flop k type flip flop binary counter state diagram mealy state machine moore state machine one hot cold codes chapter  registers and counters   registers clocked sequential circuit consists of group of flip flops and combinational gates the flip flops are essential because in their absence the circuit reduces to purely combinational circuit provided that there is no feedback among the gates  circuit with flip flops is considered sequential circuit even in the absence of combinational gates circuits that include flip flops are usually classified by the function they perform rather than by the name of the sequential circuit two such circuits are registers and counters register is group of flip flops each one of which shares common clock and is capable of storing one bit of information an bit register consists of group of flip flops capable of storing bits of binary information in addition to the flip flops register may have combinational gates that perform certain data processing tasks in its broadest definition register consists of group of flip flops together with gates that affect their operation the flip flops hold the binary information and the gates determine how the information is transferred into the register counter is essentially register that goes through predetermined sequence of binary states the gates in the counter are connected in such way as to produce the prescribed sequence of states although counters are special type of register it is common to differentiate them by giving them different name various types of registers are available commercially the simplest register is one that consists of only flip flops without any gates figure   shows such register constructed with four type flip flops to form four bit data storage register the common clock input triggers all flip flops on the positive edge of each pulse and the binary data available at the four inputs are transferred into the register the value of     immediately before the clock edge determines the value of     after the clock edge the four   d c i a r d c i a r clock clear figure   four bit register outputs can be sampled at any time to obtain the binary information stored in the register the input clear goes to the active low reset input of all four flip flops when this input goes to  all flip flops are reset asynchronously the clear input is useful for clearing the register to all prior to its clocked operation the inputs must be maintained section   registers   at logic  e  de asserted during normal clocked operation note that depending on the flip flop either clear clear reset or reset can be used to indicate the transfer of the register to an all state register with parallel load registers with parallel load are fundamental building block in digital systems it is important that you have thorough understanding of their behavior synchronous digital systems have master clock generator that supplies continuous train of clock pulses the pulses are applied to all flip flops and registers in the system the master clock acts like drum that supplies constant beat to all parts of the system separate control signal must be used to decide which register operation will execute at each clock pulse the transfer of new information into register is referred to as loading or updating the register if all the bits of the register are loaded simultaneously with common clock pulse we say that the loading is done in parallel clock edge applied to the inputs of the register of fig   will load all four inputs in parallel in this configuration if the contents of the register must be left unchanged the inputs must be held constant or the clock must be inhibited from the circuit in the first case the data bus driving the register would be unavailable for other traffic in the second case the clock can be inhibited from reaching the register by controlling the clock input signal with an enabling gate however inserting gates into the clock path is ill advised because it means that logic is performed with clock pulses the insertion of logic gates produces uneven propagation delays between the master clock and the inputs of flip flops to fully synchronize the system we must ensure that all clock pulses arrive at the same time anywhere in the system so that all flip flops trigger simultaneously performing logic with clock pulses inserts variable delays and may cause the system to go out of synchronism for this reason it is advisable to control the operation of the register with the inputs rather than controlling the clock in the inputs of the flip flops this creates the effect of gated clock but without affecting the clock path of the circuit four bit data storage register with load control input that is directed through gates and into the inputs of the flip flops is shown in fig   the additional gates implement two channel mux whose output drives the input to the register with either the data bus or the output of the register the load input to the register determines the action to be taken with each clock pulse when the load input is  the data at the four external inputs are transferred into the register with the next positive edge of the clock when the load input is  the outputs of the flip flops are connected to their respective inputs the feedback connection from output to input is necessary because d flip flop does not have no change condition with each clock edge the input determines the next state of the register to leave the output unchanged it is necessary to make the input equal to the present value of the output e  the output circulates to the input at each clock pulse  the clock pulses are applied to the inputs without interruption the load input determines whether the next pulse will accept new information or leave the information in the register intact the transfer of information from the data inputs or the outputs of the register is done simultaneously with all four bits in response to clock edge load i a c a c a c   clock figure   four bit register with parallel load shift registers register capable of shifting the binary information held in each cell to its neighboring cell in selected direction is called shift register the logical configuration of shift register consists of chain of flip flops in cascade with the output of one flip flop connected to the input of the next flip flop all flip flops receive common clock pulses which activate the shift of data from one stage to the next the simplest possible shift register is one that uses only flip flops as shown in fig    the output of given flip flop is connected to the input of the flip flop at its right this shift register is unidirectional left to right  each clock pulse shifts the contents of the section   shift registers   serial si d d so serial input output c c clk figure   four bit shift register register one bit position to the right the configuration does not support left shift the serial input determines what goes into the leftmost flip flop during the shift the serial output is taken from the output of the rightmost flip flop sometimes it is necessary to control the shift so that it occurs only with certain pulses but not with others as with the data register discussed in the previous section the clocks signal can be suppressed by gating the clock signal to prevent the register from shifting preferred alternative in high speed circuits is to suppress the clock action rather than gate the clock signal by leaving the clock path unchanged but recirculating the output of each register cell back through two channel mux whose output is connected to the input of the cell when the clock action is not suppressed the other channel of the mux provides datapath to the cell it will be shown later that the shift operation can be controlled through the inputs of the flip flops rather than through the clock input if however the shift register of fig   is used the shift can be controlled with an input by connecting the clock through an and gate this is not preferred practice note that the simplified schematics do not show reset signal but such signal is required in practical designs serial transfer the datapath of digital system is said to operate in serial mode when information is transferred and manipulated one bit at time information is transferred one bit at time by shifting the bits out of the source register and into the destination register this type of transfer is in contrast to parallel transfer whereby all the bits of the register are transferred at the same time the serial transfer of information from register to register is done with shift registers as shown in the block diagram of fig    the serial output so of register is connected to the serial input si of register to prevent the loss of information stored in the source register the information in register is made to circulate by connecting the serial output to its serial input the initial content of register is shifted out through its serial output and is lost unless it is transferred to third shift register the shift control input determines when and how many times the registers are shifted for illustration here this is done with an and gate that allows clock pulses to pass into the clk terminals only when the shift control is active  this practice can be problematic because it may compromise the clock path of the circuit as discussed earlier  suppose the shift registers in fig   have four bits each then the control unit that supervises the transfer of data must be designed in such way that it enables the shift sia soa sib shift register sob shift register clk clk clock shift control block diagram clock shift control clk t t  timing diagram figure   serial transfer from register to register registers through the shift control signal for fixed time of four clock pulses in order to pass an entire word this design is shown in the timing diagram of fig   the shift control signal is synchronized with the clock and changes value just after the negative edge of the clock the next four clock pulses find the shift control signal in the active state so the output of the and gate connected to the clk inputs produces four pulses    and  each rising edge of the pulse causes shift in both registers the fourth pulse changes the shift control to  and the shift registers are disabled assume that the binary content of before the shift is   and that of is    the serial transfer from to occurs in four steps as shown in table   with the first pulse  the rightmost bit of is shifted into the leftmost bit of and is also circulated into the leftmost position of at the same time all bits of and are shifted one position to the right the previous serial output from in the rightmost position is lost and its value changes from  to  the next three pulses perform identical operations shifting the bits of into one at time after the fourth shift the shift control goes to  and registers and both have the value    thus the contents of are copied into so that the contents of remain unchanged e  the contents of are restored to their original value the difference between the serial and the parallel mode of operation should be apparent from this example in the parallel mode information is available from all bits of register and all bits can be transferred simultaneously during one clock pulse in the serial section   shift registers   table   serial transfer example timing pulse shift register shift register initial value                after         after         after         after mode the registers have single serial input and single serial output the information is transferred one bit at time while the registers are shifted in the same direction serial addition operations in digital computers are usually done in parallel because that is faster mode of operation serial operations are slower because datapath operation takes several clock cycles but serial operations have the advantage of requiring fewer hardware components in vlsi circuits they require less silicon area on chip to demonstrate the serial mode of operation we present the design of serial adder the parallel counterpart was presented in section   the two binary numbers to be added serially are stored in two shift registers beginning with the least significant pair of bits the circuit adds one pair at time through single full adder fa circuit as shown in fig   the carry out of the full adder is transferred to d flip flop the output of which is then used as the carry input for the next pair of significant bits the sum bit from the output of the full adder could be transferred into third shift register by shifting the sum into while the bits of are shifted out it is possible to use one register for storing both the augend and the sum bits the serial input of register can be used to transfer new binary number while the addend bits are shifted out during the addition the operation of the serial adder is as follows initially register holds the augend register holds the addend and the carry flip flop is cleared to  the outputs so of and provide pair of significant bits for the full adder at and output of the flip flop provides the input carry at the shift control enables both registers and the carry flip flop so at the next clock pulse both registers are shifted once to the right the sum bit from enters the leftmost flip flop of and the output carry is transferred into flip flop the shift control enables the registers for number of clock pulses equal to the number of bits in the registers for each succeeding clock pulse new sum bit is transferred to a new carry is transferred to and both registers are shifted once to the right this process continues until the shift control is disabled thus the addition is accomplished by passing each pair of bits together with the previous carry through single full adder circuit and transferring the sum one bit at time into register initially register and the carry flip flop are cleared to  and then the first number is added from while is shifted through the full adder second number is transferred shift si so control shift register clk augend s fa serial si so c input shift register addend d clear figure   serial adder to it through its serial input the second number is then added to the contents of register while third number is transferred serially into register this can be repeated to perform the addition of two three or more four bit numbers and accumulate their sum in register comparing the serial adder with the parallel adder described in section   we note several differences the parallel adder uses registers with parallel load whereas the serial adder uses shift registers the number of full adder circuits in the parallel adder is equal to the number of bits in the binary numbers whereas the serial adder requires only one full adder circuit and carry flip flop excluding the registers the parallel adder is combinational circuit whereas the serial adder is sequential circuit which consists of full adder and flip flop that stores the output carry this design is typical in serial operations because the result of bit time operation may depend not only on the present inputs but also on previous inputs that must be stored in flip flops to show that serial operations can be designed by means of sequential circuit procedure we will redesign the serial adder with the use of state table first we assume that two shift registers are available to store the binary numbers to be added serially the serial outputs from the registers are designated by and the sequential circuit to be designed will not include the shift registers but they will be inserted later to show the complete circuit the sequential circuit proper has the two inputs and that provide pair of significant bits an output that generates the sum bit and flip flop for storing the carry the state table that specifies the sequential circuit is listed in table   the present state

                                    is added together with inputs and to produce the sum bit in output the next state of is equal to the output carry note that the state table entries are identical to the entries in full adder truth table except that the input carry is now the present state of and the output carry is now the next state of if d flip flop is used for the circuit reduces to the one shown in fig    if jk flip flop is used for it is necessary to determine the values of inputs and by referring to the excitation table table    this is done in the last two columns of table   the two flip flop input equations and the output equation can be simplified by means of maps to jq  xy kq  xy   s  y the circuit diagram is shown in fig    the circuit consists of three gates and jk flip flop the two shift registers are included in the diagram to show the complete serial adder note that output is function not only of and but also of the present state of the next state of is function of the present state of and of the values of and that come out of the serial outputs of the shift registers universal shift register if the flip flop outputs of shift register are accessible then information entered serially by shifting can be taken out in parallel from the outputs of the flip flops if parallel load capability is added to shift register then data entered in parallel can be taken out in serial fashion by shifting the data stored in the register some shift registers provide the necessary input and output terminals for parallel transfer they may also have both shift right and shift left capabilities the most general shift register has the following capabilities   clear control to clear the register to    clock input to synchronize the operations cosnhtirftol sshi ift registersao

only some of the preceding functions with at least one shift operation register capable of shifting in one direction only is unidirectional shift register one that can shift in both directions is bidirectional shift register if the register has both shifts and parallel load capabilities it is referred to as universal shift register the block diagram symbol and the circuit diagram of four bit universal shift register that has all the capabilities just listed are shown in fig    the circuit consists of four flip flops and four multiplexers the four multiplexers have two common selection inputs and  input  in each multiplexer is selected when s    input  is selected when s    and similarly for the other two inputs the selection inputs control the mode of operation of the register according to the function entries in table   when s    the present value of the register is applied to the inputs of the flip flops this condition forms path from the output of each flip flop into the input of the same flip flop so that the output recirculates to the input in this mode of operation the next clock edge transfers into each flip flop the binary value it held previously and no change

simultaneously during the next clock edge note that data enters msb in for shift right operation and enters lsb in for shift left operation clear is an active low signal that clears all of the flip flops shift registers are often used to interface digital systems situated remotely from each other for example suppose it is necessary to transmit an bit quantity between two points if the distance is far it will be expensive to use lines to transmit the bits in parallel it is more economical to use single line and transmit the information serially one bit at time the transmitter accepts the bit data in parallel into shift register and then transmits the data serially along the common line the receiver accepts the data serially into shift register when all bits are received they can be taken from the outputs of the register in parallel thus the transmitter performs parallel to serial conversion of data and the receiver does serial to parallel conversion   ripple counters register that goes through prescribed sequence of states upon the application of input pulses is called counter the input pulses may be clock pulses or they may originate from some external source and may occur at fixed interval of time or at random the sequence of states may follow the binary number sequence or any other sequence of states counter that follows the binary number sequence is called binary counter an bit binary counter consists of flip flops and can count in binary from  through  counters are available in two categories ripple counters and synchronous counters in ripple counter flip flop output transition serves as source for triggering other flip flops in other words the input of some or all flip flops are triggered not by the common clock pulses but rather by the transition that occurs in other flip flop outputs in synchronous counter the inputs of all flip flops receive the common clock synchronous counters are presented in the next two sections here we present the binary and bcd ripple counters and explain their operation section   ripple counters   binary ripple counter binary ripple counter consists of series connection of complementing flip flops with the output of each flip flop connected to the input of the next higher order flip flop the flip flop holding the least significant bit receives the incoming count pulses complementing flip flop can be obtained from jk flip flop with the and inputs tied together or from t flip flop third possibility is to use d flip flop with the complement output connected to the input in this way the input is always the complement of the present state and the next clock pulse will cause the flip flop to complement the logic diagram of two  bit binary ripple counters is shown in fig    the counter is constructed with complementing flip flops of the type in part and type in part  the output of each flip flop is connected to the input of the next flip flop in sequence the flip flop holding the least significant bit receives the incoming count pulses the inputs of all the flip flops in are connected to permanent logic  making each flip flop complement if the signal in its input goes through negative transition the bubble in front of the dynamic indicator symbol next to indicates that the flip flops respond to the negative edge transition of the input the negative transition occurs when the output of the previous flip flop to which is connected goes from  to  to understand the operation of the four bit binary ripple counter refer to the first nine binary numbers listed in table   the count starts with binary  and increments by  with each count pulse input after the count of   the counter goes back to  to repeat the count the least significant bit  is complemented with each count pulse input every time that goes from  to  it complements  every time that goes from  to  it complements  every time that goes from  to  it complements  and so on for any other higher order bits of ripple counter for example consider the transition from count   to    is complemented with the count pulse since goes from  to  it triggers and complements it as result goes from  to  which in turn complements  changing it from  to  does not trigger  because produces positive transition and the flip flop responds only to negative transitions thus the count from   to   is achieved by changing the bits one at time so the table   binary count sequence                                         a a count r count cr a a cr cr a a cr cr a a cr cr logic  reset reset with flip flops with flip flops figure   four bit binary ripple counter section   ripple counters   count goes from   to    then to    and finally to    the flip flops change one at time in succession and the signal propagates through the counter in ripple fashion from one stage to the next binary counter with reverse count is called binary countdown counter in countdown counter the binary count is decremented by  with every input count pulse the count of four bit countdown counter starts from binary  and continues to binary counts            and then back to   list of the count sequence of binary countdown counter shows that the least significant bit is complemented with every count pulse any other bit in the sequence is complemented if its previous least significant bit goes from  to  therefore the diagram of binary countdown counter looks the same as the binary ripple counter in fig    provided that all flip flops trigger on the positive edge of the clock  the bubble in the inputs must be absent  if negative edge triggered flip flops are used then the input of each flip flop must be connected to the complemented output of the previous flip flop then when the true output goes from  to  the complement will go from  to  and complement the next flip flop as required bcd ripple counter decimal counter follows sequence of  states and returns to  after the count of  such counter must have at least four flip flops to represent each decimal digit since decimal digit is represented by binary code with at least four bits the sequence of states in decimal counter is dictated by the binary code used to represent decimal digit if bcd is used the sequence of states is as shown in the state diagram of fig    decimal counter is similar to binary counter except that the state after    the code for decimal digit  is    the code for decimal digit   the logic diagram of bcd ripple counter using jk flip flops is shown in fig    the four outputs are designated by the letter symbol with numeric subscript equal to the binary weight of the corresponding bit in the bcd code note that the output of is applied to the inputs of both and and the output of is applied to the input of  the and inputs are connected either to permanent  signal or to outputs of other flip flops ripple counter is an asynchronous sequential circuit signals that affect the flip flop transition depend on the way they change from  to  the operation of the counter can                          figure   state diagram of decimal bcd counter count k q k q k q k logic  figure   bcd ripple counter be explained by list of conditions for flip flop transitions these conditions are derived from the logic diagram and from knowledge of how jk flip flop operates remember that when the input goes from  to  the flip flop is

 block diagram of three decade decimal bcd counter to verify that these conditions result in the sequence required by bcd ripple counter it is necessary to verify that the flip flop transitions indeed follow sequence of states as specified by the state diagram of fig    changes state after each clock pulse complements every time goes from  to  as long as    when becomes  remains at  complements every time goes from  to  remains at  as long as or is  when both and become  complements when goes from  to  is cleared on the next transition of  the bcd counter of fig    is decade counter since it counts from  to  to count in decimal from  to   we need two decade counter to count from  to   we need three decade counter multiple decade counters can be constructed by connecting bcd counters in cascade one for each decade three decade counter is shown in fig    the inputs to the second and third decades come from of the previous decade when in one decade goes from  to  it triggers the count for the next higher order decade while its own decade goes from  to    synchronous counters synchronous counters are different from ripple counters in that clock pulses are applied to the inputs of all flip flops common clock triggers all flip flops simultaneously rather than one at time in succession as in ripple counter the decision whether flip flop is to be complemented is determined from the values of the data inputs such as or and at the time of the clock edge if   or    the flip flop does not change state if   or    the flip flop complements the design procedure for synchronous counters was presented in section   and the design of three bit binary counter was carried out in conjunction with fig    in this section we present some typical synchronous counters and explain their operation binary counter the design of synchronous binary counter is so simple that there is no need to go through sequential logic design process in synchronous binary counter the flip flop in the least significant position is complemented with every pulse flip flop in any other position is complemented when all the bits in the lower significant positions are equal to  for example if the present state of four bit counter is a a     the next count is    is always complemented is complemented because the present state of    is complemented because the present state of a    however is not complemented because the present state of a     which does not give an all condition synchronous binary counters have regular pattern and can be constructed with complementing flip flops and gates the regular pattern can be seen from the four bit counter depicted in fig    the inputs of all flip flops are connected to common clock the counter is enabled by count enable if the enable input is  all and inputs are equal to  and the clock does not change the state of the counter the first stage  has its and equal to  if the counter is enabled the other and inputs are equal to  if all previous least significant stages are equal to  and the count is enabled the chain of and gates generates the required logic for the and inputs in each stage the counter can be extended to any number of stages with each stage having an additional flip flop and an and gate that gives an output of  if all previous flip flop outputs are  note that the flip flops trigger on the positive edge of the clock the polarity of the clock is not essential here but it is with the ripple counter the synchronous counter can be triggered with either the positive or the negative clock edge the complementing flip flops in binary counter can be of either the jk type the type or the type with xor gates the equivalency of the three types is indicated in fig    upcdown binary counter synchronous countdown binary counter goes through the binary states in reverse order from   down to   and back to   to repeat the count it is possible to design countdown counter in the usual manner but the result is predictable by inspection of the downward binary count the bit in the least significant position is complemented with each pulse bit in any other position is complemented if all lower significant bits are equal to  for example the next state after the present state of   is    the least significant bit is always complemented the second significant bit is complemented because the first bit is  the third significant bit is complemented because the first two bits are equal to  but the fourth bit does not change because not all lower significant bits are equal to  countdown binary counter can be constructed as shown in fig    except that the inputs to the and gates must come from the complemented outputs instead of the normal outputs of the previous flip flops the two operations can be combined in one circuit to form counter capable of counting either up or down the circuit of an upcdown binary counter using flip flops is shown in fig    it has an up control input and down control input when the up input is  the circuit counts up since the inputs receive their signals from the values of the previous normal outputs of the flip flops when the down input is  and the up input is  the circuit counts down since the complemented outputs of the previous flip flops are applied to the inputs when the up and down inputs are both  the circuit does not change state and remains section

has priority over the down input bcd counter bcd counter counts in binary coded decimal from   to   and back to    because of the return to  after count of  bcd counter does not have regular pattern unlike straight binary count to derive the circuit of bcd synchronous counter it is necessary to go through sequential circuit design procedure the state table of bcd counter is listed in table   the input conditions for the flip flops are obtained from the present and next state conditions also shown in the table is an output which is equal to  when the present state is    in this way can enable the count of the next higher significant decade while the same pulse switches the present decade from   to    the flip flop input equations can be simplified by means of maps the unused states for

bcd counters can be cascaded to form counter for decimal numbers of any length the cascading is done as in fig    except that output must be connected to the count input of the next higher significant

                                     binary counter with parallel load counters employed in digital systems quite often require parallel load capability for transferring an initial binary number into the counter prior to the count operation figure   shows the top level block diagram symbol and the logic diagram of four bit register that has parallel load capability and can operate as counter when equal to  the input load control disables the count operation and causes transfer of data from the four data inputs into the four flip flops if both control inputs are  clock pulses do not change the state of the register the carry output becomes  if all the flip flops are equal to  while the count input is enabled this is the condition for complementing the flip flop that holds the next significant bit the carry output is useful for expanding the counter to more than four bits the speed of the counter is increased when the carry is generated directly from the outputs of all four flip flops because the delay to generate the carry bit is reduced in going from state   to    only one gate delay occurs whereas four gate delays occur in the and gate chain shown in fig    similarly each flip flop is associated with an and gate that receives all previous flip flop outputs directly instead of connecting the and gates in chain the operation of the counter is summarized in table   the four control inputs clear clk load and countdetermine the next state the clear input is asynchronous and when equal to  causes the counter to be cleared regardless of the presence of clock pulses or other inputs this relationship is indicated in the table by the entries which symbolize dont care conditions for the other inputs the clear input must be in the  state for all other operations with the load and count inputs both at  the outputs do not change even when clock pulses are applied load input of  causes transfer from inputs i into the register during positive edge of clk the input data are loaded into the register regardless of the value of the count input because the count input is inhibited when the load input is enabled the load input must be  for the count input to control the operation of the counter counter with parallel load can be used to generate any desired count sequence figure   shows two ways in which counter with parallel load is used to generate the bcd count in each case the count control is set to  to enable the count through the clk input also recall that the load control inhibits the count and that the clear operation is independent of other control inputs the and gate in fig    detects the occurrence of state    the counter is initially cleared to  and then the clear and count inputs are set to  so the counter is active at all times as long as the output of the and gate is  each positive edge clock table   function table for the counter of fig    clear clk load count function  x clear to    load inputs    count next binary state    no

using counter with parallel load increments the counter by  when the output reaches the count of    both and become  making the output of the and gate equal to  this condition activates the load input therefore on the next clock edge the register does not count but is loaded from its four inputs since all four inputs are connected to logic  an all value is loaded into the register following the count of    thus the circuit goes through the count from   through   and back to    as is required in bcd counter in fig     the nand gate detects the count of    but as soon as this count occurs the register is cleared the count   has no chance of staying on for any appreciable time because the register goes immediately to  momentary spike occurs in output as the count goes from   to   and immediately to    the spike may be undesirable and for that reason this configuration is not recommended if the counter has synchronous clear input it is possible to clear the counter with the clock after an occurrence of the   count   other counters counters can be designed to generate any desired sequence of states divide by counter also known as modulo counter is counter that goes through repeated sequence of states the sequence may follow the binary count or may be any other arbitrary sequence counters are used to generate timing signals to control the sequence of operations in digital system counters can also be constructed by means of shift registers in this section we present few examples of nonbinary counters counter with unused states circuit with flip flops has binary states there are occasions when sequential circuit uses fewer than this maximum possible number of states states that are not used section   other counters   in specifying the sequential circuit are not listed in the state table in simplifying the input equations the unused states may be treated as dont care conditions or may be assigned specific next states it is important to realize that once the circuit is designed and constructed outside interference during its operation may cause the circuit to enter one of the unused states in that case it is necessary to ensure that the circuit eventually goes into one of the valid states so that it can resume normal operation otherwise if the sequential circuit circulates among unused states there will be no way to bring it back to its intended sequence of state transitions if the unused states are treated as dont care conditions then once the circuit is designed it must be investigated to determine the effect of the unused states the next state from an unused state can be determined from the analysis of the circuit after it is designed as an illustration consider the counter specified in table   the count has repeated sequence of six states with flip flops and repeating the binary count       and flip flop alternating between  and  every three counts the count sequence of the counter is not straight binary and two states   and   are not included in the count the choice of jk flip flops results in the flip flop input conditions listed in the table inputs kb and kc have only and xs in their columns so these inputs are always equal to  the other flip flop input equations can be simplified by using minterms  and  as dont care conditions the simplified equations are ja  ka  jb  kb   jc  kc   the logic diagram of the counter is shown in fig     since there are two unused states we analyze the circuit to determine their effect if the circuit happens to be in state   because of an error signal the circuit goes to state   after the application of clock pulse this action may be determined from an inspection of the logic diagram by noting that when   the next clock edge complements and clears to  and when   the next clock edge complements in similar manner we can evaluate the next state from present state   to be   table   state table for counter present state next state flip flop inputs ab a c ja ka jb kb

diagram including the effect of the unused states is shown in fig     if the circuit ever goes to one of the unused states because of outside interference the next count pulse transfers it to one of the valid states and the circuit continues to count correctly thus the counter is self correcting in self correcting counter if the counter happens to be in one of the unused states it eventually reaches the normal count sequence after one or more clock pulses an alternative design could use additional logic to direct every unused state to specific next state ring counter timing signals that control the sequence of operations in digital system can be generated by shift register or by counter with decoder ring counter is circular shift register with only one flip flop being set at any particular time all others are cleared the single bit is shifted from one flip flop to the next to produce the sequence of timing signals figure   shows four bit shift register connected as ring counter the initial value of the register is   and requires preset clear flip flops the single bit is section   other counters   shift t t right ring counter initial value    clk t t  sequence of four timing signals t t   decoder count  bit counter enable counter and decoder figure   generation of timing signals shifted right with every clock pulse and circulates back from to  each flip flop is in the  state once every four clock cycles and produces one of the four timing signals shown in fig     each output becomes  after the negative edge transition of clock pulse and remains  during the next clock cycle for an alternative design the timing signals can be generated by two bit counter that goes through four distinct states the decoder shown in fig    decodes the four states of the counter and generates the required sequence of timing signals to generate timing signals we need either shift register with flip flops or an bit binary counter together with an to line decoder for example   timing signals can be generated with  bit shift register connected as ring counter or with  bit binary counter and  to  line decoder in the first case we need  flip flops in the second we need  flip flops and  four input and gates for the decoder it is also possible to generate the timing signals with combination of shift register and decoder that way the number of flip flops is less than that in ring counter and the decoder requires only two input gates this combination is called johnson counter johnson counter k bit ring counter circulates single bit among the flip flops to provide distinguishable states the number of states can be doubled if the shift register is connected as switch tail ring counter switch tail ring counter is circular shift register with the complemented output of the last flip flop connected to the input of the first flip flop figure   shows such shift register the circular connection is made from the a b c e c c b e clk four stage switch tail ring counter sequence flip flop outputs and gate required number abce for output    ae ab    bc ce    ae    ab bc    ce            count sequence and required decoding figure   construction of johnson counter section   hdl for registers and counters   complemented output of the rightmost flip flop to the input of the leftmost flip flop the register shifts its contents once to the right with every clock pulse and at the same time the complemented value of the flip flop is transferred into the flip flop starting from cleared state the switch tail ring counter goes through sequence of eight states as listed in fig     in general k bit switch tail ring counter will go through sequence of states starting from all each shift operation inserts from the left until the register is filled with all in the next sequences  are inserted from the left until the register is again filled with all a johnson counter is k bit switch tail ring counter with decoding gates to provide outputs for timing signals the decoding gates are not shown in fig    but are specified in the last column of the table the eight and gates listed in the table when connected to the circuit will complete the construction of the johnson counter since each gate is enabled during one particular state sequence the outputs of the gates generate eight timing signals in succession the decoding of k bit switch tail ring counter to obtain timing signals follows regular pattern the all state is decoded by taking the complement of the two extreme flip flop outputs the all state is decoded by taking the normal outputs of the two extreme flip flops all other states are decoded from an adjacent   or   pattern in the sequence for example sequence  has an adjacent   pattern in flip flops and the decoded output is then obtained by taking the complement of and the normal output of or bc one disadvantage of the circuit in fig    is that if it finds itself in an unused state it will persist in moving from one invalid state to another and never find its way to valid state the difficulty can be corrected by modifying the circuit to avoid this undesirable condition one correcting procedure is to disconnect the output from flip flop that goes to the input of flip flop and instead enable the input of flip flop by the function dc   b where dc is the flip flop input equation for the input of flip flop johnson counters can be constructed for any number of timing sequences the number of flip flops needed is one half the number of timing signals the number of decoding gates is equal to the number of timing signals and only two input gates are needed   hdl for registers and counters registers and counters can be described in verilog at either the behavioral or the structural level behavioral modeling describes only the operations of the register as prescribed by function table without preconceived structure structural level description shows the circuit in terms of collection of components such as gates flip flops and multiplexers the various components are instantiated to form hierarchical description of the design similar to representation of multilevel logic diagram the examples in this section will illustrate both types of descriptions both are useful when machine is complex hierarchical description creates physical partition of the machine into simpler and more easily described units shift register the universal shift register presented in section   is bidirectional shift register with parallel load the four clocked operations that are performed with the register are specified in table   the register also can be cleared asynchronously our chosen name for behavioral description of the four bit universal shift register shown in fig    the name shift register  beh signifies the behavioral model of the internal detail of the top level block diagram symbol and distinguishes that model from structural one the behavioral model is presented in hdl example   and the structural model is given in hdl example   the top level block diagram symbol in fig   indicates that the four bit universal shift register has two selection inputs   two serial inputs shift left shift right  for controlling the shift register two serial datapath inputs msb in and lsb in  four bit parallel input par  and four bit parallel output par  the elements of vector par    correspond to the bits      in fig    and similarly for par    the always block describes the five operations that can be performed with the register the clear input clears the register asynchronously with an active low signal clear must be high for the register to respond to the positive edge of the clock the four clocked operations of the register are determined from the values of the two select inputs in the case statement  and are concatenated into two bit vector and are used as the expression argument of the case statement  the shifting operation is specified by the concatenation of the serial input and three bits of the register for example the statement par   msb in par     specifies concatenation of the serial data input for right shift operation msb in with bits par    of the output data bus reference to contiguous range of bits within vector is referred to as part select the four bit result of the concatenation is transferred to register par    when the clock pulse triggers the operation this transfer produces shift right operation and updates the register with new information the shift operation overwrites the contents of par  with the contents of par   note that only the functionality of the circuit has been described irrespective of any particular hardware synthesis tool would create netlist of asic cells to implement the shift register in

match between   and the case items so register par would be left unchanged structural model of the universal shift register can be described by referring to the logic diagram of fig   the diagram shows that the register has four multiplexers and four flip flops mux and flip flop together are modeled as stage of the shift register the stage is structural model too with an instantiation and interconnection of module for mux and another for d flip flop for simplicity the lowest level modules of the structure are behavioral models of the multiplexer and flip flop attention must be paid to the details of connecting the stages correctly the structural description of the register is shown in hdl example   the top level module declares the inputs and outputs and then instantiates four copies of stage of the register the four instantiations specify the interconnections between the four stages and provide the detailed construction of the register as specified in the logic diagram the behavioral description of the flip flop uses single edge sensitive cyclic behavior an always block  the assignment statements use the nonblocking assignment operator   the model of the mux employs single level sensitive behavior and the assignments use the blocking assignment operator   hdl example   universal shift register structural model   structural description of  bit universal shift

shift register to illustrate the different styles for modeling digital circuit simulation should verify that the models have the same functionality in practice designer develops only the behavioral

structural model produces huge improvement in the efficiency of the design process synchronous counter hdl example   presents binary counter  par load behavioral model of the synchronous counter with parallel load from fig    count load clk and clear are inputs that determine the operation of the counter according to the function specified in table   the counter has four data inputs four data outputs and carry output the internal data lines     are bundled as data in    in the behavioral model likewise the register that holds the bits of the count     is count    it is good practice to have identifiers in the hdl model of circuit correspond exactly to those in the documentation of the model that is not always feasible however if the circuit level identifiers are those found in handbook for they are often short and cryptic and do not exploit the text that is available with an hdl the top level block diagram symbol in fig    serves as an interface between the names used in circuit diagram and the expressive names that can be used in the hdl model the carry output out is generated by combinational circuit and is specified with an assign statement out  when the count

structural description of ripple counter is shown in hdl example   the first module instantiates four internally complementing flip flops defined in the second module as comp flip flop clk reset  the clock input clk of the first flip flop is connected to the external control signal count  count replaces clk in the port list of instance  the clock input of the second flip flop is connected to the output of the first  replaces clk in instance  similarly the clock of each of the other flip flops is connected to the output of the previous flip flop in this way the flip flops are chained together to create ripple counter as shown in fig    the second module describes complementing flip flop with delay the circuit of complementing flip flop is constructed by connecting the complement output to the input reset input is included with the flip flop in order to be able to initialize the counter otherwise the simulator would assign the unknown value to the output of the flip flop and produce useless results the flip flop is assigned delay of two time units from the time that the clock is applied to the time that the flip flop complements its output the delay is specified by the statement    notice that the delay operator is placed to the right of the nonblocking assignment operator this form of delay called intra assignment delay has the effect of postponing the assignment of the complemented value of to the effect of modeling the delay will be apparent in the simulation results this style of modeling might be useful in simulation but it is to be avoided when the model is to be synthesized the results of synthesis depend on the asic cell library that is accessed by the tool not on any propagation delays that might appear within the model that is to be synthesized section

counter switch tail ring counter upcdown counter chapter  memory and programmable logic   introduction memory unit is device to which binary information is transferred for storage and from which information is retrieved when needed for processing when data processing takes place information from memory is transferred to selected registers in the processing unit intermediate and final results obtained in the processing unit are transferred back to be stored in memory binary information received from an input device is stored in memory and information transferred to an output device is taken from memory memory unit is collection of cells capable of storing large quantity of binary information there are two types of memories that are used in digital systems random access memory ram and read only memory rom  ram stores new information for later use the process of storing new information into memory is referred to as memory write operation the process of transferring the stored information out of memory is referred to as memory read operation ram can perform both write and read operations rom can perform only the read operation this means that suitable binary information is already stored inside memory and can be retrieved or read at any time however that information cannot be altered by writing rom is programmable logic device pld  the binary information that is stored within such device is specified in some fashion and then embedded within the hardware in process is referred to as programming the device the word programming here refers to hardware procedure which specifies the bits that are inserted into the hardware configuration of the device rom is one example of pld other such units are the programmable logic array pla  programmable array logic pal  and the field programmable gate array fpga  pld is an integrated circuit with internal logic gates connected through electronic   conventional symbol array logic symbol figure   conventional and array logic diagrams for or gate paths that behave similarly to fuses in the original state of the device all the fuses are intact programming the device involves blowing those fuses along the paths that must be removed in order to obtain the particular configuration of the desired logic function in this chapter we introduce the configuration of plds and indicate procedures for their use in the design of digital systems we also present cmos fpgas which are configured by downloading stream of bits into the device to configure transmission gates to establish the internal connectivity required by specified logic function combinational or sequential  typical pld may have hundreds to millions of gates interconnected through hundreds to thousands of internal paths in order to show the internal logic diagram of such device in concise form it is necessary to employ special gate symbology applicable to array logic figure   shows the conventional and array logic symbols for multiple input or gate instead of having multiple input lines into the gate we draw single line entering the gate the input lines are drawn perpendicular to this single line and are connected to the gate through internal fuses in similar fashion we can draw the array logic for an and gate this type of graphical representation for the inputs of gates will be used throughout the chapter in array logic diagrams   random access memory memory unit is collection of storage cells together with associated circuits needed to transfer information into and out of device the architecture of memory is such that information can be selectively retrieved from any of its internal locations the time it takes to transfer information to or from any desired random location is always the samehence the name random access memory abbreviated ram in contrast the time required to retrieve information that is stored on magnetic tape depends on the location of the data memory unit stores binary information in groups of bits called words word in memory is an entity of bits that move in and out of storage as unit memory word is group of and and may represent number an instruction one or more alphanumeric characters or any other binary coded information group of  bits is called byte most computer memories use words that are multiples of  bits in length thus  bit word contains two bytes and  bit word is made up of four bytes the capacity of memory unit is usually stated as the total number of bytes that the unit can store section   random access memory   address lines data input lines read write memory unit words figure   block diagram of memory unit bit per word data output lines communication between memory and its environment is achieved through data input and output lines address selection lines and control lines that specify the direction of transfer block diagram of memory unit is shown in fig    the data input lines provide the information to be stored in memory and the data output lines supply the information coming out of memory the address lines specify the particular word chosen among the many available the two control inputs specify the direction of transfer desired the write input causes binary data to be transferred into the memory and the read input causes binary data to be transferred out of memory the memory unit is specified by the number of words it contains and the number of bits in each word the address lines select one particular word each word in memory is assigned an identification number called an address starting from  up to  where is the number of address lines the selection of specific word inside memory is done by applying the bit address to the address lines an internal decoder accepts this address and opens the paths needed to select the word specified memories vary greatly in size and may range from    words requiring an address of  bits to   words requiring  address bits it is customary to refer to the number of words or bytes in memory with one of the letters kilo  mega  and giga  is equal to   is equal to   and is equal to   thus         and    consider for example memory unit with capacity of words of  bits each since        and  bits constitute two bytes we can say that the memory can accommodate     bytes  figure   shows possible contents of the first three and the last three words of this memory each word contains  bits that can be divided into two bytes the words are recognized by their decimal address from  to    the equivalent binary address consists of  bits the first address is specified with ten the last address is specified with ten because    in binary is equal to       word in memory is selected by its binary address when word is read or written the memory operates on all  bits as single unit the   memory of fig   has  bits in the address and  bits in each word as another example    memory will have  bits in the address since     and each word will consist of  bits the number of address bits needed in   chapter  memory and programmable logic memory address binary decimal memory content                                                                                               figure   contents of      memory memory is dependent on the total number of words that can be stored in the memory and is independent of the number of bits in each word the number of bits in the address is determined from the relationship m where is the total number of words and is the number of address bits needed to satisfy the relationship write and read operations the two operations that ram can perform are the write and read operations as alluded to earlier the write signal specifies transfer in operation and the read signal specifies transfer out operation on accepting one of these control signals the internal circuits inside the memory provide the desired operation the steps that must be taken for the purpose of transferring new word to be stored into memory are as follows   apply the binary address of the desired word to the address lines   apply the data bits that must be stored in memory to the data input lines   activate the write input the memory unit will then take the bits from the input data lines and store them in the word specified by the address lines the steps that must be taken for the purpose of transferring stored word out of memory are as follows   apply the binary address of the desired word to the address lines   activate the read input section   random access memory   table   control inputs to memory chip memory enable read write memory operation none  write to selected word read from selected word     the memory unit will then take the bits from the word that has been selected by the address and apply them to the output data lines the contents of the selected word do not change after the read operation e  the word operation is nondestructive commercial memory components available in integrated circuit chips sometimes provide the two control inputs for reading and writing in somewhat different configuration instead of having separate read and write inputs to control the two operations most integrated circuits provide two other control inputs one input selects the unit and the other determines the operation the memory operations that result from these control inputs are specified in table   the memory enable sometimes called the chip select is used to enable the particular memory chip in multichip implementation of large memory when the memory enable is inactive the memory chip is not selected and no operation is performed when the memory enable input is active the read write input determines the operation to be performed memory description in hdl memory is modeled in the verilog hardware description language hdl by an array of registers it is declared with reg keyword using two dimensional array the first number in the array specifies the number of bits in word the word length and the second gives the number of words in memory memory depth  for example memory of    words with  bits per word is declared as reg    memword      this statement describes two dimensional array of    registers each containing  bits the second array range in the declaration of memword specifies the total number of words in memory and is equivalent to the address of the memory for example memword   refers to the  bit memory word at address   the operation of memory unit is illustrated in hdl example   the memory has  words of four bits each there are two control inputs enable and readwrite the datain and dataout lines have four bits each the input address must have six bits since      the memory is declared as two dimensional array of registers with mem used as an identifier that can be referenced with an index to access any of the  words memory operation requires that the enable input be active the readwrite input determines the type of operation if readwrite is  the memory performs read operation symbolized by the statement dataout mem address  execution of this statement causes transfer of four bits from the selected memory word specified by address onto the dataout lines if readwrite is  the memory performs write operation symbolized by the statement mem address datain execution of this statement causes transfer from the four bit datain lines into the memory word selected by address when enable is equal to  the memory is disabled and the outputs are assumed to be in high impedance state indicated by the symbol thus the memory has three state outputs hdl example    read and write operations of memory  memory size is  words of four bits each module memory enable readwrite address datain dataout  input enable readwrite input    datain input    address output    dataout reg    dataout reg    mem         memory always  enable or readwrite if enable if readwrite dataout  mem address   read else mem address  datain   write else dataout   bz   high impedance state endmodule timing waveforms the operation of the memory unit is controlled by an external device such as central processing unit cpu  the cpu is usually synchronized by its own clock the memory however does not employ an internal clock instead its read and write operations are specified by control inputs the access time of memory is the time required to select word and read it the cycle time of memory is the time required to complete write operation the cpu must provide the memory control signals in such way as to synchronize its internal clocked operations with the read and write operations of memory this means that the access time and cycle time of the memory must be within time equal to fixed number of cpu clock cycles suppose as an example that cpu operates with clock frequency of  mhz giving period of  ns for one clock cycle suppose also that the cpu communicates with memory whose access time and cycle time do not exceed  ns this means that the section   random access memory   clock  nsec t t memory address address valid memory initiate writing latched enable data valid read  write cycle write data input  nsec t t clock address valid memory address memory initiate read enable read write data data valid output read cycle figure   memory cycle timing waveforms write cycle terminates the storage of the selected word within  ns interval and that the read cycle provides the output data of the selected word within  ns or less  the two numbers are not always the same  since the period of the cpu cycle is  ns it will be necessary to devote at least two and half and possibly three clock cycles for each memory request the memory timing shown in fig   is for cpu with  mhz clock and memory with  ns maximum cycle time the write cycle in part shows three  ns cycles   and  for write operation the cpu must provide the address and input data to the memory this is done at the beginning of   the two lines that cross each other in the address and data waveforms designate possible change in value of the multiple lines  the memory enable and the read write signals must be activated after the signals in the address lines are stable in order to avoid destroying data in other memory words the memory enable signal switches to the high level and the read write signal switches to the low level to indicate write operation the two control signals must stay active for at least  ns the address and data signals must remain stable for short time after the control signals are deactivated at the completion of the third clock cycle the memory write operation is completed and the cpu can access the memory again with the next  cycle the read cycle shown in fig   has an address for the memory provided by the cpu the memory enable and read write signals must be in their high level for read operation the memory places the data of the word selected by the address into the output data lines within  ns interval or less from the time that the memory enable is activated the cpu can transfer the data into one of its internal registers during the negative transition of  the next cycle is available for another memory request types of memories the mode of access of memory system is determined by the type of components used in random access memory the word locations may be thought of as being separated in space each word occupying one particular location in sequential access memory the information stored in some medium is not immediately accessible but is available only at certain intervals of time magnetic disk or tape unit is of this type each memory location passes the read and write heads in turn but information is read out only when the requested word has been reached in random access memory the access time is always the same regardless of the particular location of the word in sequential access memory the time it takes to access word depends on the position of the word with respect to the position of the read head therefore the access time is variable integrated circuit ram units are available in two operating modes static and dynamic static ram sram consists essentially of internal latches that store the binary information the stored information remains valid as long as power is applied to the unit dynamic ram dram stores the binary information in the form of electric charges on capacitors provided inside the chip by mos transistors the stored charge on the capacitors tends to discharge with time and the capacitors must be periodically recharged by refreshing the dynamic memory refreshing is done by cycling through the words every few milliseconds to restore the decaying charge dram offers reduced power consumption and larger storage capacity in single memory chip sram is easier to use and has shorter read and write cycles memory units that lose stored information when power is turned off are said to be volatile cmos integrated circuit rams both static and dynamic are of this category since the binary cells need external power to maintain the stored information in contrast nonvolatile memory such as magnetic disk retains its stored information after the removal section   memory decoding   of power this type of memory is able to retain information because the data stored on magnetic components are represented by the direction of magnetization which is retained after power is turned off rom is another nonvolatile memory nonvolatile memory enables digital computers to store programs that will be needed again after the computer is turned on programs and data that cannot be altered are stored in rom while other large programs are maintained on magnetic disks the latter programs are transferred into the computer ram as needed before the power is turned off the binary information from the computer ram is transferred to the disk so that the information will be retained   memory decoding in addition to requiring storage components in memory unit there is need for decoding circuits to select the memory word specified by the input address in this section we present the internal construction of ram and demonstrate the operation of the decoder to be able to include the entire memory in one diagram the memory unit presented here has small capacity of  bits arranged in four words of  bits each an example of two dimensional coincident decoding arrangement is presented to show more efficient decoding scheme that is used in large memories we then give an example of address multiplexing commonly used in dram integrated circuits internal construction the internal construction of ram of words and bits per word consists of  binary storage cells and associated decoding circuits for selecting individual words the binary storage cell is the basic building block of memory unit the equivalent logic of binary cell that stores one bit of information is shown in fig    the storage part of the cell is modeled by an sr latch with associated gates to form d latch actually the select select input output input bc output read write read write block diagram logic diagram figure   memory cell cell is an electronic circuit with four to six transistors nevertheless it is possible and convenient to model it in terms of logic symbols binary storage cell must be very small in order to be able to pack as many cells as possible in the small area available in the integrated circuit chip the binary cell stores one bit in its internal latch the select input enables the cell for reading or writing and the read write input determines the operation of the cell when it is selected  in the read write input provides the read operation by forming path from the latch to the output terminal  in the read write input provides the write operation by forming path from the input terminal to the latch the logical construction of small ram is shown in fig    this ram consists of four words of four bits each and has total of  binary cells the small blocks labeled bc represent the binary cell with its three inputs and one output as specified in fig    memory with four words needs two address lines the two address inputs go through    decoder to select one of the four words the decoder is enabled with input data word  bc bc bc bc address word  inputs  bc bc bc bc decoder word  bc bc bc bc memory en enable word  bc bc bc bc read write output data figure   diagram of    ram section   memory decoding   the memory enable input when the memory enable is  all outputs of the decoder are  and none of the memory words are selected with the memory select at  one of the four words is selected dictated by the value in the two address lines once word has been selected the read write input determines the operation during the read operation the four bits of the selected word go through or gates to the output terminals  note that the or gates are drawn according to the array logic established in fig    during the write operation the data available in the input lines are transferred into the four binary cells of the selected word the binary cells that are not selected are disabled and their previous binary values remain unchanged when the memory select input that goes into the decoder is equal to  none of the words are selected and the contents of all cells remain unchanged regardless of the value of the read write input commercial rams may have capacity of thousands of words and each word may range from  to  bits the logical construction of large capacity memory would be direct extension of the configuration shown here memory with words of bits per word requires address lines that go into k  decoder each one of the decoder outputs selects one word of bits for reading or writing coincident decoding decoder with inputs and outputs requires and gates with inputs per gate the total number of gates and the number of inputs per gate can be reduced by employing two decoders in two dimensional selection scheme the basic idea in two dimensional decoding is to arrange the memory cells in an array that is close as possible to square in this configuration two  input decoders are used instead of one input decoder one decoder performs the row selection and the other the column selection in two dimensional matrix configuration the two dimensional selection pattern is demonstrated in fig   for k word memory instead of using single      decoder we use two    decoders with the single decoder we would need    and gates with  inputs in each in the two decoder case we need  and gates with  inputs in each the five most significant bits of the address go to input and the five least significant bits go to input each word within the memory array is selected by the coincidence of one line and one line thus each word in memory is selected by the coincidence between  of  rows and  of  columns for total of    words note that each intersection represents word that may have any number of bits as an example consider the word whose address is   the  bit binary equivalent of   is       this makes     binary   and     binary   the bit word that is selected lies in the decoder output number  and the decoder output number   all the bits of the word are selected for reading or writing address multiplexing the sram memory cell modeled in fig   typically contains six transistors in order to build memories with higher density it is necessary to reduce the number of transistors in cell the dram cell contains single mos transistor and capacitor the charge stored   decoder                  binary address           decoder  y     figure   two dimensional decoding structure for k word memory on the capacitor discharges with time and the memory cells must be periodically recharged by refreshing the memory because of their simple cell structure drams typically have four times the density of srams this allows four times as much memory capacity to be placed on given size of chip the cost per bit of dram storage is three to four times less than that of sram storage further cost savings is realized because of the lower power requirement of dram cells these advantages make dram the preferred technology for large memories in personal digital computers dram chips are available in capacities from  to  bits most drams have  bit word size so several chips have to be combined to produce larger word size because of their large capacity the address decoding of drams is arranged in two dimensional array and larger memories often have multiple arrays to reduce the number of pins in the ic package designers utilize address multiplexing whereby one set of address input pins accommodates the address components in two dimensional array the address is applied in two parts at different times with the row address first and the column address second since the same set of pins is used for both parts of the address the size of the package is decreased significantly we will use  word memory to illustrate the address multiplexing idea diagram of the decoding configuration is shown in fig    the memory consists of section   memory decoding   cas  bit column register    decoder ras  bit  bit        read write address row decoder memory register cell array data data in out figure   address multiplexing for  dram two dimensional array of cells arranged into   rows by   columns for total of          words there is single data input line single data output line and read write control as well as an eight bit address input and two address strobes the latter included for enabling the row and column address into their respective registers the row address strobe ras enables the eight bit row register and the column address strobe cas enables the eight bit column register the bar on top of the name of the strobe symbol indicates that the registers are enabled on the zero level of the signal the  bit address is applied to the dram in two steps using ras and cas initially both strobes are in the  state the  bit row address is applied to the address inputs and ras is changed to  this loads the row address into the row address register ras also enables the row decoder so that it can decode the row address and select one row of the array after time equivalent to the settling time of the row selection ras goes back to the  level the  bit column address is then applied to the address inputs and cas is driven to the  state this transfers the column address into the column register and enables the column decoder now the two parts of the address are in their respective registers the decoders have decoded them to select the one cell corresponding to the row and column address and read or write operation can be performed on that cell cas must go back to the  level before initiating another memory operation   error detection and correction the dynamic physical interaction of the electrical signals affecting the data path of memory unit may cause occasional errors in storing and retrieving the binary information the reliability of memory unit may be improved by employing error detecting and error correcting codes the most common error detection scheme is the parity bit  see section    parity bit is generated and stored along with the data word in memory the parity of the word is checked after reading it from memory the data word is accepted if the parity of the bits read out is correct if the parity checked results in an inversion an error is detected but it cannot be corrected an error correcting code generates multiple parity check bits that are stored with the data word in memory each check bit is parity over group of bits in the data word when the word is read back from memory the associated parity bits are also read from memory and compared with new set of check bits generated from the data that have been read if the check bits are correct no error has occurred if the check bits do not match the stored parity they generate unique pattern called syndrome that can be used to identify the bit that is in error single error occurs when bit changes in value from  to  or from  to  during the write or read operation if the specific bit in error is identified then the error can be corrected by complementing the erroneous bit hamming code one of the most common error correcting codes used in rams was devised by w hamming in the hamming code parity bits are added to an bit data word forming new word of  bits the bit positions are numbered in sequence from  to  those positions numbered as power of  are reserved for the parity bits the remaining bits are the data bits the code can be used with words of any length before giving the general characteristics of the code we will illustrate its operation with data word of eight bits consider for example the  bit data word      we include  parity bits with the  bit word and arrange the  bits as follows bit position              p         section   error detection and correction   the  parity bits    and  are in positions     and  respectively the  bits of the data word are in the remaining positions each parity bit is calculated as follows  xor of bits                      xor of bits                       xor of bits                   xor of bits                   remember that the exclusive or operation performs the odd function it is equal to  for an odd number of in the variables and to  for an even number of thus each parity bit is set so that the total number of in the checked positions including the parity bit is always even the  bit data word is stored in memory together with the  parity bits as  bit composite word substituting the  bits in their proper positions we obtain the  bit composite word stored in memory             bit position               when the  bits are read from memory they are checked again for errors the parity is checked over the same combination of bits including the parity bit the  check bits are evaluated as follows  xor of bits            xor of bits            xor of bits          xor of bits           check bit designates even parity over the checked bits and  designates odd parity since the bits were stored with even parity the result  c c     indicates that no error has occurred however if  then the  bit binary number formed by the check bits gives the position of the erroneous bit for example consider the following three cases bit position                           no error             error in bit              error in bit  in the first case there is no error in the  bit word in the second case there is an error in bit position number  because it changed from  to  the third case shows an error in bit position  with change from  to  evaluating the xor of the corresponding bits we determine the  check bits to be as follows c c for no error     with error in bit      with error in bit      thus for no error we have     with an error in bit  we obtain     and with an error in bit  we get     when the binary number is not equal to    it gives the position of the bit in error the error can be corrected by complementing the corresponding bit note that an error can occur in the data word or in one of the parity bits the hamming code can be used for data words of any length in general the hamming code consists of check bits and data bits for total of  bits the syndrome value consists of bits and has range of values between  and  one of these values usually zero is used to indicate that no error was detected leaving  values to indicate which of the  bits was in error each of these  values can be used to uniquely describe bit in error therefore the range of must be equal to or greater than  giving the relationship   solving for in terms of we obtain  n this relationship gives formula for establishing the number of data bits that can be used in conjunction with check bits for example when   the number of data bits that can be used is        for   we have       giving   the data word may be less than  bits but must have at least  bits otherwise only  check bits will be needed this justifies the use of  check bits for the  data bits in the previous example ranges of for various values of are listed in table   the grouping of bits for parity generation and checking can be determined from list of the binary numbers from  through  the least significant bit is  in the binary numbers       and so on the second significant bit is  in the binary numbers table   range of data bits range of data bits for check bits number of check bits c             section   read only memory         and so on comparing these numbers with the bit positions used in generating and checking parity bits in the hamming code we note the relationship between the bit groupings in the code and the position of the  bits in the binary count sequence note that each group of bits starts with number that is power of          etc these numbers are also the position numbers for the parity bits single error correction double error detection the hamming code can detect and correct only single error by adding another parity bit to the coded word the hamming code can be used to correct single error and detect double errors if we include this additional parity bit then the previous  bit coded word becomes        where  is evaluated from the exclusive or of the other  bits this produces the  bit word        even parity  when the  bit word is read from memory the check bits are evaluated as is the parity over the entire  bits if   the parity is correct even parity  but if   then the parity over the  bits is incorrect odd parity  the following four cases can arise if   and   no error occurred if  and   single error occurred that can be corrected if  and   double error occurred that is detected but that cannot be corrected if   and   an error occurred in the  bit this scheme may detect more than two errors but is not guaranteed to detect all such errors integrated circuits use modified hamming code to generate and check parity bits for single error correction and double error detection the modified hamming code uses more efficient parity configuration that balances the number of bits used to calculate the xor operation typical integrated circuit that uses an  bit data word and  bit check word is ic type    other integrated circuits are available for data words of  and  bits these circuits can be used in conjunction with memory unit to correct single error or detect double errors during write and read operations   read only memory read only memory rom is essentially memory device in which permanent binary information is stored the binary information must be specified by the designer and is then embedded in the unit to form the required interconnection pattern once the pattern is established it stays within the unit even when power is turned off and on again block diagram of rom consisting of inputs and outputs is shown in fig    the inputs provide the address for memory and the outputs give the data bits of the stored word that is selected by the address the number of words in rom is determined from the fact that address input lines are needed to specify words note that rom does not have data inputs because it does not have write operation integrated inputs address  n outputs data rom figure   rom block diagram circuit rom chips have one or more enable inputs and sometimes come with three state outputs to facilitate the construction of large arrays of rom consider for example    rom the unit consists of  words of  bits each there are five input lines that form the binary numbers from  through  for the address figure   shows the internal logic construction of this rom the five inputs are decoded into  distinct outputs by means of    decoder each output of the decoder represents memory address the  outputs of the decoder are connected to each of the eight or gates the diagram shows the array logic convention used in complex circuits  see fig    each or gate must be considered as having  inputs each output of the decoder is connected to one of the inputs of each or gate since each or gate has  input connections and there are  or gates the rom contains       internal connections in general k  rom will have an internal  decoder and or gates each or gate has inputs which are connected to each of the outputs of the decoder          decoder         a a a a figure   internal logic of    rom section   read only memory   the   intersections in fig    are programmable programmable connection between two lines is logically equivalent to switch that can be altered to be either closed meaning that the two lines are connected or open meaning that the two lines are disconnected  the programmable intersection between two lines is sometimes called crosspoint various physical devices are used to implement crosspoint switches one of the simplest technologies employs fuse that normally connects the two points but is opened or blown by the application of high voltage pulse into the fuse the internal binary storage of rom is specified by truth table that shows the word content in each address for example the content of    rom may be specified with truth table similar to the one shown in table   the truth table shows the five inputs under which are listed all  addresses each address stores word of  bits which is listed in the outputs columns the table shows only the first four and the last four words in the rom the complete table must include the list of all  words the hardware procedure that programs the rom blows fuse links in accordance with given truth table for example programming the rom according to the truth table given by table   results in the configuration shown in fig    every  listed in the truth table specifies the absence of connection and every  listed specifies path that is obtained by connection for example the table specifies the eight bit word     for permanent storage at address  the four in the word are programmed by blowing the fuse links between output  of the decoder and the inputs of the or gates associated with outputs    and  the four in the word are marked with  to denote temporary connection in place of dot used for permanent connection in logic diagrams when the input of the rom is    all the outputs of the decoder are  except for output  which is at logic  the signal equivalent to logic  at decoder output  propagates through the connections to the or gate outputs of    and  the other four outputs remain at  the result is that the stored word     is applied to the eight data outputs table   rom truth table partial inputs outputs      a a a a                                                     f                                                              decoder         a a a a figure   programming the rom according to table   combinational circuit implementation in section   it was shown that decoder generates the minterms of the input variables by inserting or gates to sum the minterms of boolean functions we were able to generate any desired combinational circuit the rom is essentially device that includes both the decoder and the or gates within single device to form minterm generator by choosing connections for those minterms which are included in the function the rom outputs can be programmed to represent the boolean functions of the output variables in combinational circuit the internal operation of rom can be interpreted in two ways the first interpretation is that of memory unit that contains fixed pattern of stored words the second interpretation is that of unit which implements combinational circuit from this point of view each output terminal is considered separately as the output of boolean function expressed as sum of minterms for example the rom of fig    may be considered to be combinational circuit with eight outputs each function of the five input variables output can be expressed in sum of minterms as i               the three dots represent minterms  through   which are not specified in the figure  connection marked with  in the figure produces minterm for the sum all other crosspoints are not connected and are not included in the sum in practice when combinational circuit is designed by means of rom it is not necessary to design the logic or to show the internal gate connections inside the unit all that the designer has to do is specify the particular rom by its ic number and provide the applicable truth table the truth table gives all the information for programming the rom no internal logic diagram is needed to accompany the truth table section   read only memory   example   design combinational circuit using rom the circuit accepts three bit number and outputs binary number equal to the square of the input number the first step is to derive the truth table of the combinational circuit in most cases this is all that is needed in other cases we can use partial truth table for the rom by utilizing certain properties in the output variables table   is the truth table for the combinational circuit three inputs and six outputs are needed to accommodate all possible binary numbers we note that output is always equal to input  so there is no need to generate with rom since it is equal to an input variable moreover output is always  so this output is known constant we actually need to generate only four outputs with the rom the other two are readily obtained the minimum size of rom needed must have three inputs and four outputs three inputs specify eight words so the rom must be of size    the rom implementation is shown in fig    the three inputs specify eight words of four bits each the truth table in fig    specifies the information needed for programming the rom the block diagram of fig    shows the required connections of the combinational circuit table   truth table for circuit of example   inputs outputs a b b b decimal                                                                                   a a b b              b             b               rom             b  rom truth table block diagram figure   rom implementation of example   types of roms the required paths in rom may be programmed in four different ways the first is called mask programming and is done by the semiconductor company during the last fabrication process of the unit the procedure for fabricating rom requires that the customer fill out the truth table he or she wishes the rom to satisfy the truth table may be submitted in special form provided by the manufacturer or in specified format on computer output medium the manufacturer makes the corresponding mask for the paths to produce the and according to the customers truth table this procedure is costly because the vendor charges the customer special fee for custom masking the particular rom for this reason mask programming is economical only if large quantity of the same rom configuration is to be ordered for small quantities it is more economical to use second type of rom called programmable read only memory or prom when ordered prom units contain all the fuses intact giving all in the bits of the stored words the fuses in the prom are blown by the application of high voltage pulse to the device through special pin blown fuse defines binary  state and an intact fuse gives binary  state this procedure allows the user to program the prom in the laboratory to achieve the desired relationship between input addresses and stored words special instruments called prom programmers are available commercially to facilitate the procedure in any case all procedures for programming roms are hardware procedures even though the word programming is used the hardware procedure for programming roms or proms is irreversible and once programmed the fixed pattern is permanent and cannot be altered once bit pattern has been established the unit must be discarded if the bit pattern is to be changed third type of rom is the erasable prom or eprom which can be restructured to the initial state even though it has been programmed previously when the eprom is placed under special ultraviolet light for given length of time the shortwave radiation discharges the internal floating gates that serve as the programmed connections after erasure the eprom returns to its initial state and can be reprogrammed to new set of values the fourth type of rom is the electrically erasable prom eeprom or prom  this device is like the eprom except that the previously programmed connections can be erased with an electrical signal instead of ultraviolet light the advantage is that the device can be erased without removing it from its socket flash memory devices are similar to eeproms but have additional built in circuitry to selectively program and erase the device in circuit without the need for special programmer they have widespread application in modern technology in cell phones digital cameras set top boxes digital tv telecommunications nonvolatile data storage and microcontrollers their low consumption of power makes them an attractive storage medium for laptop and notebook computers flash memories incorporate additional circuitry too allowing simultaneous erasing of blocks of memory for example of size  to  bytes like eeproms flash memories are subject to fatigue typically having about   block erase cycles section   programmable logic array   inputs fixed programmable outputs and array or array decoder  programmable read only memory prom inputs programmable fixed outputs and array or array programmable array logic pal inputs programmable programmable outputs and array or array programmable logic array pla figure   basic configuration of three plds combinational plds the prom is combinational programmable logic device pld an integrated circuit with programmable gates divided into an and array and an or array to provide an andcor sum of product implementation there are three major types of combinational plds differing in the placement of the programmable connections in the andc or array figure   shows the configuration of the three plds the prom has fixed and array constructed as decoder and programmable or array the programmable or gates implement the boolean functions in sum of minterms form the pal has programmable and array and fixed or array the and gates are programmed to provide the product terms for the boolean functions which are logically summed in each or gate the most flexible pld is the pla in which both the and and or arrays can be programmed the product terms in the and array may be shared by any or gate to provide the required sum of products implementation the names pal and pla emerged from different vendors during the development of plds the implementation of combinational circuits with prom was demonstrated in this section the design of combinational circuits with pla and pal is presented in the next two sections   programmable logic array the pla is similar in concept to the prom except that the pla does not provide full decoding of the variables and does not generate all the minterms the decoder is replaced by an array of and gates that can be programmed to generate any product term of the input variables the product terms are then connected to or gates to provide the sum of products for the required boolean functions the internal logic of pla with three inputs and two outputs is shown in fig    such circuit is too small to be useful commercially but is presented here to demonstrate the typical logic configuration of pla the diagram uses the array logic graphic symbols for complex circuits each input goes through buffercinverter combination shown in the diagram with composite graphic symbol that has both the true and complement outputs each input and its complement are connected to the inputs of each and gate as indicated by the intersections between the vertical and horizontal lines the outputs of the and gates are connected to the inputs of each or gate the output of the or gate goes to an xor gate where the other input can be programmed to receive signal equal to either logic  or logic  the output is inverted when the xor input is connected to  since     the output does not change when the xor input is connected to  since     the particular boolean functions implemented in the pla of fig    are  ab  ac  abc   ac  bc b  ab  ac  bc  abc c b a   f figure   pla with three inputs four product terms and two outputs section   programmable logic array   the product terms generated in each and gate are listed along the output of the gate in the diagram the product term is determined from the inputs whose crosspoints are connected and marked with  the output of an or gate gives the logical sum of the selected product terms the output may be complemented or left in its true form depending on the logic being realized the fuse map of pla can be specified in tabular form for example the programming table that specifies the pla of fig    is listed in table   the pla programming table consists of three sections the first section lists the product terms numerically the second section specifies the required paths between inputs and and gates the third section specifies the paths between the and and or gates for each output variable we may have t for true or for complement for programming the xor gate the product terms listed on the left are not part of the table they are included for reference only for each product term the inputs are marked with    or dash  if variable in the product term appears in the form in which it is true the corresponding input variable is marked with  if it appears complemented the corresponding input variable is marked with  if the variable is absent from the product term it is marked with dash the paths between the inputs and the and gates are specified under the column head inputs in the programming table  in the input column specifies connection from the input variable to the and gate  in the input column specifies connection from the complement of the variable to the input of the and gate dash specifies blown fuse in both the input variable and its complement it is assumed that an open terminal in the input of an and gate behaves like  the paths between the and and or gates are specified under the column head outputs the output variables are marked with for those product terms which are included in the function each product term that has  in the output column requires path from the output of the and gate to the input of the or gate those marked with dash specify blown fuse it is assumed that an open terminal in the input of an or gate behaves like  finally t true output dictates that the other input of the corresponding xor gate be connected to  and c complement specifies connection to  table   pla programming table product term inputs outputs  ab  bc f ac       bc         abc   note see text for meanings of dashes the size of pla is specified by the number of inputs the number of product terms and the number of outputs typical integrated circuit pla may have  inputs   product terms and eight outputs for inputs product terms and outputs the internal logic of the pla consists of buffercinverter gates and gates or gates and xor gates there are  connections between the inputs and the and array  connections between the and and or arrays and connections associated with the xor gates in designing digital system with pla there is no need to show the internal connections of the unit as was done in fig    all that is needed is pla programming table from which the pla can be programmed to supply the required logic as with rom the pla may be mask programmable or field programmable with mask programming the customer submits pla program table to the manufacturer this table is used by the vendor to produce custom made pla that has the required internal logic specified by the customer second type of pla that is available is the field programmable logic array or fpla which can be programmed by the user by means of commercial hardware programmer unit in implementing combinational circuit with pla careful investigation must be undertaken in order to reduce the number of distinct product terms since pla has finite number of and gates this can be done by simplifying each boolean function to minimum number of terms the number of literals in term is not important since all the input variables are available anyway both the true value and the complement of each function should be simplified to see which one can be expressed with fewer product terms and which one provides product terms that are common to other functions example   implement the following two boolean functions with pla a c        a c        the two functions are simplified in the maps of fig    both the true value and the complement of the functions are simplified into sum of products form the combination that gives the minimum number of product terms is   ab  ac  bc and  ab  ac  abc this combination gives four distinct product terms ab ac bc and abc the pla programming table for the combination is shown in the figure note that output is the true output even though c is marked over it in the table this is because is generated with an andcor circuit and is available at the output of the or gate the xor gate complements the function to produce the true output section   programmable array logic   pla programming table bc bc a  outputs             m product inputs f m m m term b          ab     m m m a  ac           bc    abc     c figure   solution to example   the combinational circuit used in example   is too simple for implementing with pla it was presented merely for purposes of illustration typical pla has large number of inputs and product terms the simplification of boolean functions with so many variables should be carried out by means of computer assisted simplification procedures the computer aided design cad program simplifies each function and its complement to minimum number of terms the program then selects minimum number of product terms that cover all functions in the form in which they are true or in their complemented form the pla programming table is then generated and the required fuse map obtained the fuse map is applied to an fpla programmer that goes through the hardware procedure of blowing the internal fuses in the integrated circuit   programmable array logic the pal is programmable logic device with fixed or array and programmable and array because only the and gates are programmable the pal is easier to program than but is not as flexible as the pla figure   shows the logic configuration of typical pal with four inputs and four outputs each input has buffercinverter gate and each output is generated by fixed or gate there are four sections in the unit each composed of an andcor array that is three wide the term used to indicate that there are three programmable and gates in each section and one fixed or gate each and gate has  programmable input connections shown in the diagram by  vertical lines intersecting each horizontal line the horizontal line symbolizes the multiple input configuration of the and gate one of the outputs is connected to buffercinverter gate and then fed back into two inputs of the and gates commercial pal devices contain more gates than the one shown in fig    typical pal integrated circuit may have eight inputs eight outputs and eight sections each consisting of an eight wide andcor array the output terminals are sometimes driven by three state buffers or inverters in designing with pal the boolean functions must be simplified to fit into each section unlike the situation with pla product term cannot be shared among two or more or gates therefore each function can be simplified by itself without regard product and gates inputs term                                    figure   pal with four inputs four outputs and three wide andcor structure section   programmable array logic   to common product terms the number of product terms in each section is fixed and if the number of terms in the function is too large it may be necessary to use two sections to implement one boolean function as an example of using pal in the design of combinational circuit consider the following boolean functions given in sum of minterms form a c        a c                   a c                    a c           simplifying the four functions to minimum number of terms results in the following boolean functions  abc  abcd   bcd  ab  cd  bd  abc  abcd  acd  abcd   acd  abcd note that the function for has four product terms the logical sum of two of these terms is equal to by using it is possible to reduce the number of terms for from four to three the pal programming table is similar to the one used for the pla except that only the inputs of the and gates need to be programmed table   lists the pal table   pal programming table and inputs product term ab cdw outputs  abc  abcd       bcd  ab  cd  bd        acd  abcd                              product and gates inputs term a b c d w    a all fuses intact  always    fuse intact fuse blown        a b c d w figure   fuse map for pal as specified in table   section   sequential programmable devices   programming table for the four boolean functions the table is divided into four sections with three product terms in each to conform with the pal of fig    the first two sections need only two product terms to implement the boolean function the last section for output needs four product terms using the output from we can reduce the function to three terms the fuse map for the pal as specified in the programming table is shown in fig    for each  or  in the table we mark the corresponding intersection in the diagram with the symbol for an intact fuse for each dash we mark the diagram with blown fuses in both the true and complement inputs if the and gate is not used we leave all its input fuses intact since the corresponding input receives both the true value and the complement of each input variable we have aa   and the output of the and gate is always  as with all plds the design with pals is facilitated by using cad techniques the blowing of internal fuses is hardware procedure done with the help of special electronic instruments   sequential programmable devices digital systems are designed with flip flops and gates since the combinational pld consists of only gates it is necessary to include external flip flops when they are used in the design sequential programmable devices include both gates and flip flops in this way the device can be programmed to perform variety of sequential circuit functions there are several types of sequential programmable devices available commercially and each device has vendor specific variants within each type the internal logic of these devices is too complex to be shown here therefore we will describe three major types without going into their detailed construction   sequential or simple programmable logic device spld   complex programmable logic device cpld   field programmable gate array fpga the sequential pld is sometimes referred to as simple pld to differentiate it from the complex pld the spld includes flip flops in addition to the andcor array within the integrated circuit chip the result is sequential circuit as shown in fig    pal or pla is modified by including number of flip flops connected to form register the circuit outputs can be taken from the or gates or from the outputs of the inputs andcor array outputs pal or pla flip flops figure   sequential programmable logic device flip flops additional programmable connections are available to include the flip flop outputs in the product terms formed with the and array the flip flops may be of the or the jk type the first programmable device developed to support sequential circuit implementation is the field programmable logic sequencer fpls  typical fpls is organized around pla with several outputs driving flip flops the flip flops are flexible in that they can be programmed to operate as either the jk or the type the fpls did not succeed commercially because it has too many programmable connections the configuration mostly used in an spld is the combinational pal together with flip flops pal that includes flip flops is referred to as registered pal to signify that the device contains flip flops in addition to the andcor array each section of an spld is called macrocell which is circuit that contains sum of products combinational logic function and an optional flip flop we will assume an andcor sum of products function but in practice it can be any one of the two level implementations presented in section   figure   shows the logic of basic macrocell the andcor array is the same as in the combinational pal shown in fig    the output is driven by an edge triggered flip flop connected to common clock input and changes state on clock edge the output of the flip flop is connected to three state buffer or inverter controlled by an output enable signal marked in the diagram as oe the output of the flip flop is fed back into one of the inputs of the programmable and gates to provide the present state condition for the sequential circuit typical spld has from  to  macrocells within clk oe clk figure   basic macrocell logic section   sequential programmable devices   one ic package all the flip flops are connected to the common clk input and all three state buffers are controlled by the oe input in addition to programming the and array macrocell may have other programming features typical programming options include the ability to either use or bypass the flip flop the selection of clock edge polarity the selection of preset and clear for the register and the selection of the true value or complement of an output an xor gate is used to program true complement condition multiplexers select between two or four distinct paths by programming the selection inputs the design of digital system using plds often requires the connection of several devices to produce the complete specification for this type of application it is more economical to use complex programmable logic device cpld  which is collection of individual plds on single integrated circuit programmable interconnection structure allows the plds to be connected to each other in the same way that can be done with individual plds figure   shows the general configuration of cpld the device consists of multiple plds interconnected through programmable switch matrix the inputcoutput o blocks provide the connections to the ic pins each o pin is driven by three state buffer and can be programmed to act as input or output the switch matrix receives inputs from the o block and directs them to the individual macrocells similarly selected outputs from macrocells are sent to the outputs as needed each pld typically contains from  to  macrocells usually fully connected if macrocell has unused product terms they can be used by other nearby macrocells in some cases the macrocell flip flop is programmed to act as d jk or flip flop different manufacturers have taken different approaches to the general architecture of cplds areas in which they differ include the individual plds sometimes called pld pld pld pld pld o programmable switch matrix o block block pld pld pld figure   general cpld configuration function blocks  the type of macrocells the o blocks and the programmable interconnection structure the best way to investigate vendor specific device is to look at the manufacturers literature the basic component used in vlsi design is the gate array which consists of pattern of gates fabricated in an area of silicon that is repeated thousands of times until the entire chip is covered with gates arrays of one thousand to several hundred thousand gates are fabricated within single ic chip depending on the technology used the design with gate arrays requires that the customer provide the manufacturer the desired interconnection pattern the first few levels of the fabrication process are common and independent of the final logic function additional fabrication steps are required to interconnect the gates according to the specifications given by the designer field programmable gate array fpga is vlsi circuit that can be programmed at the users location typical fpga consists of an array of millions of logic blocks surrounded by programmable input and output blocks and connected together via programmable interconnections there is wide variety of internal configurations within this group of devices the performance of each type of device depends on the circuit contained in its logic blocks and the efficiency of its programmed interconnections typical fpga logic block consists of lookup tables multiplexers gates and flip flops lookup table is truth table stored in an sram and provides the combinational circuit functions for the logic block these functions are realized from the lookup table in the same way that combinational circuit functions are implemented with rom as described in section   for example    sram can store the truth table of combinational circuit that has four inputs and two outputs the combinational logic section along with number of programmable multiplexers is used to configure the input equations for the flip flop and the output of the logic block the advantage of using ram instead of rom to store the truth table is that the table can be programmed by writing into memory the disadvantage is that the memory is volatile and presents the need for the lookup tables content to be reloaded in the event that power is disrupted the program can be downloaded either from host computer or from an onboard prom the program remains in sram until the fpga is reprogrammed or the power is turned off the device must be reprogrammed every time power is turned on the ability to reprogram the fpga can serve variety of applications by using different logic implementations in the program the design with pld cpld or fpga requires extensive computer aided design cad tools to facilitate the synthesis procedure among the tools that are available are schematic entry packages and hardware description languages hdls  such as abel vhdl and verilog synthesis tools are available that allocate configure and connect logic blocks to match high level design description written in hdl as an example of cmos fpga technology we will discuss the xilinx fpga   see www altera com for an alternative cmos fpga architecture section   sequential programmable devices   xilinx fpgas xilinx launched the worlds first commercial fpga in    with the vintage xc   device family  the xc   and xc   families soon followed setting the stage for todays spartan and virtex device families each evolution of devices brought improvements in density performance power consumption voltage levels pin counts and functionality for example the spartan family of devices initially offered maximum of  system gates but todays spartan  offers     logic cells plus  mb block ram basic xilinx architecture the basic architecture of spartan and earlier device families consists of an array of configurable logic blocks clbs  variety of local and global routing resources and inputcoutput o blocks iobs  programmable o

www xilinx com for detailed up to date information about xilinx products configurable logic block clb each clb consists of programmable lookup table multiplexers registers and paths for control signals as shown in fig    two of the function generators and of the lookup table can generate any arbitrary function of four inputs and the third can generate any boolean function of three inputs the function block can get its inputs from the and lookup tables or from external inputs the three function generators can be programmed to generate   three different functions of three independent sets of variables two with four inputs and one with three inputsone function must be registered within the clb    an arbitrary function of five variables   an arbitrary function of four variables together with some functions of six variables and   some functions of nine variables each clb has two storage devices that can be configured as edge triggered flip flops with common clock or in the xc  they can be configured as flip flops or as transparent latches with common clock programmed for either edge and separately invertible and an enable the storage elements can get their inputs from the function generators or from the din input the other element can get an external input from the input the function generators can also drive two outputs and directly and independently of the outputs of the storage elements all of these outputs can be connected to the interconnect network the storage elements are driven by global set reset during power up the global set reset is programmed to match the programming of the local r control for given storage element distributed ram the three function generators within clb can be used as either    dual port ram or    single port ram the xc   devices do not have block ram but group of their clbs can form an array of memory spartan devices have block ram in addition to distributed ram interconnect resources grid of switch matrices overlays the architecture of clbs to provide general purpose interconnect for branching and routing throughout the device the interconnect has three types of general purpose interconnects single length lines double length lines and long lines grid of horizontal and vertical single length lines connects an array of switch boxes that provide reduced number of connections between signal paths within each box not full crossbar switch each clb has pair of three state buffers that can drive signals onto the nearest horizontal lines above or below the clb direct dedicated interconnect lines provide routing between adjacent vertical and horizontal clbs in the same column or row these are relatively high speed local connections through metal but are not as fast as hardwired metal connection because of the delay incurred by routing the signal paths through the transmission gates that configure the path direct interconnect lines do not use the switch matrices thus eliminating the delay incurred on paths

entering switch matrix skipping every other clb these lines provide more efficient implementation of intermediate length connections by eliminating switch matrix from the path thereby reducing the delay of the path long lines span the entire array vertically and horizontally they drive low skew high fan out control signals long vertical lines have programmable splitter that segments the lines and allows two independent routing channels spanning one half of the array but located in the same column the routing resources are exploited automatically by the routing software there are eight low skew global buffers for clock distribution the signals that drive long lines are buffered long lines can be driven by adjacent clbs or iobs and may connect to three state buffers that are available to clbs long lines provide three state buses within the architecture and implement wired and logic each horizontal long line is driven by three state buffer and can be programmed to connect to pull up resistor which pulls the line to logical  if no driver is asserted on the line the programmable interconnect resources of the device connect clbs and iobs either directly or through switch boxes these resources consist of grid of two layers of metal segments and programmable interconnect points pips within switch boxes pip is cmos transmission gate whose state on or off is determined by the content of static ram cell in the programmable memory as shown in fig    the connection is established when the transmission gate is on e  when  is applied at the gate of the channel transistor  and  is applied at the gate of the channel transistor thus the device can be reprogrammed simply by changing the contents of the controlling memory cell the architecture of pip based interconnection in switch box is shown in fig    which shows possible signal paths through pip the configuration of cmos transmission gates determines the connection between horizontal line and the opposite horizontal line and between the vertical lines at the connection each switch matrix pip requires six pass transistors to establish full connectivity section   sequential programmable devices   figure   circuit for

can be used as an input an output or bidirectional port an iob that is configured as an input can have direct latched or registered input in an output configuration the iob has direct or registered output the output buffer of an iob has skew and slew control the registers available to the input and output path of an iob are driven by separate invertible clocks there is global set reset internal delay elements compensate for the delay induced when clock signal passes through global buffer before reaching an iob this strategy eliminates the hold condition on the data at an external pin the three state output of an iob puts the output buffer in high impedance state the output and the enable for the output can be inverted the slew rate of the output buffer can be controlled to minimize transients on the power bus when noncritical signals are switched the iob pin can be programmed for pull up or pull down to prevent needless power consumption and noise the devices have embedded logic to support the ieee     jtag boundary scan standard there is an on chip test access port tap controller and the o cells can be configured as shift register under testing the device can be checked to verify that all the pins on pc board are connected and operate properly by creating serial chain of all of the o pins of the chips on the board master three state control signal puts all of the iobs

devices   application large on chip memory can improve system performance by eliminating or reducing the need to access off chip storage reliable clock distribution is the key to the synchronous operation of high speed digital circuits if the clock signal arrives at different times at different parts of circuit the device may fail to operate correctly clock skew reduces the available time budget of circuit by lengthening the setup time at registers it can also shorten the effective hold time margin of flip flop in shift register and cause the register to shift incorrectly at high clock frequencies shorter clock periods  the effect of skew is more significant because it represents larger fraction of the clock cycle time buffered clock trees are commonly used to minimize clock skew in

systems depends on the history of their inputs and the conditions that determine their future actions depend on the results of previous actions such systems are said to have memory digital system is sequential logic system constructed with flip flops and gates sequential circuits can be specified by means of state tables as shown in chapter  to specify large digital system with state table is very difficult because the number of states would be enormous to overcome this difficulty digital systems are designed via modular approach the system is partitioned into subsystems each of which performs some function the modules are constructed from such digital devices as registers decoders multiplexers arithmetic elements and control logic the various modules are interconnected with datapaths and control signals to form digital system in this chapter we will introduce design methodology for describing and designing large complex digital systems   register transfer level notation the modules of digital system are best defined by set of registers and the operations that are performed on the binary information stored in them examples of register operations are shift count clear and load registers are assumed to be the basic components of the digital system the information flow and processing performed on the data stored in the registers are referred to as register transfer operations well see subsequently how hardware description language hdl includes operators that correspond to the register transfer operations of digital system   digital system is represented at the register transfer level rtl when it is specified by the following three components   the set of registers in the system   the operations that are performed on the data stored in the registers   the control that supervises the sequence of operations in the system register is connected group of flip flops that stores binary information and has the capability of performing one or more elementary operations register can load new information or shift the information to the right or the left counter is register that increments number by fixed value g    flip flop is one bit register that can be set cleared or complemented in fact the flip flops and associated gates of any sequential circuit can be called registers by this definition the operations executed on the information stored in registers are elementary operations that are performed in parallel on the bits of data word during one clock cycle the data produced by the operation may replace the binary information that was in the register before the operation executed alternatively the result may be transferred to another register e  an operation on register may leave its contents unchanged  the digital circuits introduced in chapter  are registers that implement elementary operations counter with parallel load is able to perform the increment by one and load operations bidirectional shift register is able to perform the shift right and shift left operations by shifting its contents by one or more bits in specified direction the operations in digital system are controlled by signals that sequence the operations in prescribed manner certain conditions that depend on results of previous operations may determine the sequence of future operations the outputs of the control logic of digital system are binary variables that initiate the various operations in the systems registers information transfer from one register to another is designated in symbolic form by means of replacement operator the statement d denotes transfer of the contents of register into register that is replacement of the contents of register by the contents of register  for example an eight bit register holding the value     could have its contents replaced by holding the value      by definition the contents of the source register do not change after the transfer they are merely copied to  the arrow symbolizes the transfer and its direction it points from the register whose contents are being transferred and towards the register that will receive the contents control signal would determine when the operation actually executes the controller in digital system is finite state machine see chapter  whose outputs are the control signals governing the register operations in synchronous machines the operations are synchronized by the system clock for example register might be synchronized to have its contents replaced at the positive edge of the clock statement that specifies register transfer operation implies that datapath e  set of circuit connections is available from the outputs of the source register to the section   register transfer level notation   inputs of the destination register and that the destination register has parallel load capability data can be transferred serially between registers too by repeatedly shifting their contents along single wire one bit at time normally we want register transfer operation to occur not with every clock cycle but only under predetermined condition conditional statement governing register transfer operation is symbolized with an ifcthen statement such as if    then d  where is control signal generated in the control section note that the clock is not included as variable in the register transfer statements it is assumed that all transfers occur at clock edge transition e  transition from  to  or from  to   although control condition such as may become true before the clock transition the actual transfer does not occur until the clock transition does the transfers are initiated and synchronized by the action of the clock signal but the actual transition of the outputs in physical system does not result in instantaneous transitions at the outputs of the registers propagation delays depend on the physical characteristics of the transistors implementing the flip flops of the register and the wires connecting devices there is always delay however small between cause and its effect in physical system comma may be used to separate two or more operations that are executed at the same time concurrently  consider the statement if    then d  d  this statement specifies an operation that exchanges the contents of two registers moreover the operation in both registers is triggered by the same clock edge provided that    this simultaneous concurrent operation is possible with registers that have edge triggered flip flops controlled by common clock synchronizing signal  other examples of register transfers are as follows d  add contents of to  gets   d   increment by  count upwards d shr shift right r  clear to  in hardware addition is done with binary parallel adder incrementing is done with counter and the shift operation is implemented with shift register the type of operations most often encountered in digital systems can be classified into four categories   transfer operations which transfer e  copy data from one register to another   arithmetic operations which perform arithmetic g  multiplication on data in registers   logic operations which perform bit manipulation g  logical or of nonnumeric data in registers   shift operations which shift data between registers the transfer operation does not change the information content of the data being moved from the source register to the destination register unless the source and destination are the same the other three operations change the information content during the transfer the register transfer notation and the symbols used to represent the various register transfer operations are not standardized in this text we employ two types of notation the notation introduced in this section will be used informally to specify and explain digital systems at the register transfer level the next section introduces the rtl symbols used in the verilog hdl which is standardized   register transfer level in hdl digital systems can be described at the register transfer level by means of hdl in the verilog hdl descriptions of rtl operations use combination of behavioral and dataflow constructs and are employed to specify the register operations and the combinational logic functions implemented by hardware register transfers are specified by means of procedural assignment statements within an edge sensitive cyclic behavior combinational circuit functions are specified at the rtl level by means of continuous assignment statements or by procedural assignment statements within level sensitive cyclic behavior the symbol used to designate register transfer is either an equals sign   or an arrow    the symbol used to specify combinational circuit function is an equals sign synchronization with the clock is represented by associating with an always statement an event control expression in which sensitivity to the clock event is qualified by posedge or negedge the always keyword indicates that the associated block of statements will be executed repeatedly for the life of the simulation the  operator and the event control expression preceding the block of statements synchronize the execution of the statements to the clock event the following examples show the various ways to specify register transfer operation in verilog  assign     continuous assignment for addition operation always  b   level sensitive cyclic behavior  combinational logic for addition operation     edge sensitive cyclic behavior always  negedge clock   blocking procedural assignment for addition begin  register transfer operation ra  ra  rb rd  ra   edge sensitive cyclic behavior end  nonblocking procedural assignment for addition always  negedge clock   register transfer operation begin ra  ra  rb rd  ra end continuous assignments g  assign    are used to represent and specify combinational logic circuits in simulation continuous assignment statement executes when the expression on the right hand side changes the effect of execution is immediate section   register transfer level in hdl   the variable on the left hand side is updated  similarly level sensitive cyclic behavior g  always  b  executes during simulation when change is detected by its event control expression sensitivity list  the effect of assignments made by the  operator is immediate the continuous assignment statement assign   describes binary adder with inputs and and output the target operand in continuous assignment statement in this case cannot be register data type but must be type of net for example wire the procedural assignment made in the level sensitive cyclic behavior in the second example shows an alternative way of specifying combinational circuit for addition within the cyclic behavior the mechanism of the sensitivity list ensures that the output will be updated whenever or or both change there are two kinds of procedural assignments blocking and nonblocking the two are distinguished by their symbols and by their operation blocking assignments use the equals symbol   as the assignment operator and nonblocking assignments use the left arrow    as the operator blocking assignment statements are executed sequentially in the order that they are listed in sequential block when they execute they have an immediate effect on the contents of memory before the next statement can be executed nonblocking assignments are made concurrently this feature is implemented by evaluating the expression on the right hand side of each statement in the list of statements before making the assignment to their left hand sides consequently there is no interaction between the result of any assignment and the evaluation of an expression affecting another assignment also the statements associated with an edge sensitive cyclic behavior do not execute until the indicated edge condition occurs consider in the example given above in the list of blocking procedural assignment the first statement transfers the sum ra  rb to ra and the second statement transfers the new value of ra into rd the value in ra after the clock event is the sum of the values in ra and rb immediately before the clock event at the completion of the operation both ra and rd have the same value in the nonblocking procedural assignment  above  the two assignments are performed concurrently so that rd receives the original value of ra the activity in both examples is launched by the clock undergoing falling edge transition the registers in system are clocked simultaneously concurrently  the input of each flip flop determines the value that will be assigned to its output independently of the input to any other flip flop to ensure synchronous operations in rtl design and to ensure match between an hdl model and the circuit synthesized from the model it is necessary that nonblocking procedural assignments be used for all variables that are assigned value within an edge sensitive cyclic behavior always clocked  the nonblocking assignment that appears in an edge sensitive cyclic behavior models the behavior of the hardware of synchronous sequential circuit accurately in general the blocking assignment operator   is used in procedural assignment statement only when it is necessary to specify sequential ordering of multiple assignment statements hdl operators the verilog hdl operators and their symbols used in rtl design are listed in table   the arithmetic logic and shift operators describe register transfer operations the table   verilog   hdl operators operator type symbol operation

numbers the     and  operators form the sum difference product and quotient respectively of pair of operands the exponentiation operator   was added to the language in   and forms double precision floating point value from base and exponent having real integer section   register transfer level in hdl   or signed value negative numbers are represented in complement form the modulus operator produces the remainder from the division of two numbers for example     evaluates to  there are two types of binary operators for binary words bitwise and reduction the bitwise operators perform bit by bit operation on two vector operands to form vector result they take each bit in one operand and perform the operation with the corresponding bit in the other operand negation   is unary operator it complements the bits of single vector operand to form vector result the reduction operators are also unary acting on single operand and producing scalar one bit result they operate pairwise on the bits of word from right to left and yield one bit result for example the reduction nor   results in  with operand    and in  with operand    the result of applying the nor operation on the first two bits is used with the third bit and so forth negation is not used as reduction operatorits operation on vector produces vector truth tables for the bitwise operators acting on pair of scalar operands are the same as those listed in table   in section   for the corresponding verilog primitive g  the and primitive and the  bitwise operator have the same truth table  the output of an and gate with two scalar inputs is the same as the result produced by operating on the two bits with the  operator the logical and relational operators are used to form boolean expressions and can take variables or expressions as operands  note variable is also an expression  used basically for determining true or false conditions the logical and relational operators evaluate to  if the condition expressed is true and to  if the condition is false if the condition is ambiguous they evaluate to an operand that is variable evaluates to  if the value of the variable is equal to zero and to  if the value is not equal to zero for example if    and     then the expression has the boolean value  the number in question is not equal to  and the expression has the boolean value  results of other operations with these values are as follows     logical and                  bitwise and                  logical or                  bitwise or                 logical negation                bitwise negation             logical negation                bitwise negation              is greater than      identity equality the relational operators    and    test for bitwise equality identity and inequality in verilogs four valued logic system for example if  xx and  xx  the test    would evaluate to true but the test   would evaluate to verilog   has logical and arithmetic shift operators the logical shift operators shift vector operand to the right or the left by specified number of bits the vacated bit positions are filled with zeros for example if     then the statement     shifts to the right one position the value of that results from the logical right shift operation       is    in contrast the arithmetic right shift operator fills the vacated cell the most significant bit msb  with its original contents when the word is shifted to the right the arithmetic left shift operator fills the vacated cell with  when the word is shifted to the left the arithmetic right shift operator is used when the sign extension of number is important if     then the statement    produces the result     if     it produces the result     there is no distinction between the logical left shift and the arithmetic left shift operators the concatenation operator provides mechanism for appending multiple operands it can be used to specify shift including the bits transferred into the vacant positions this aspect of its operation was shown in hdl example   for the shift register expressions are evaluated from left to right and their operators associate from left to right with the exception of the conditional operator according to the precedence shown in table   for example in the expression  c the value of is added to and then is subtracted from the result in the expression  c the value of is divided by and then the result is added to because the division operator    has higher precedence than the addition operator   use parentheses to establish precedence for example the expression  c is not the same as the expression  c loop statements verilog hdl has four types of loops that execute procedural statements repeatedly repeat forever while and for all looping statements must appear inside an initial or always block the repeat loop executes the associated statements specified number of times the following is an example that was used previously initial begin clock    repeat     clock   clock end this code toggles the clock  times and produces eight clock cycles with cycle time of  time units section   register transfer level in hdl   table   highest precedence verilog

execution of procedural statement or block of procedural statements for example the following loop produces continuous clock having cycle time of  time units initial begin clock    forever   clock   clock end the while loop executes statement or block of statements repeatedly while an expression is true if the expression is false to begin with the statement is never executed the following example illustrates the use of the while loop integer count initial begin count   while count     count  count   end the value of count is incremented from  to   each increment is delayed by five time units and the loop exits at the count of   in dealing with looping statements it is sometimes convenient to use the integer data type to index the loop integers are declared with the keyword integer as in the previous example although it is possible to use reg variable to index loop sometimes it is more convenient to declare an integer variable rather than reg for counting purposes variables declared as data type reg are stored as unsigned numbers those declared as data type integer are store as signed numbers in complement format the default width of an integer is minimum of  bits the for loop is compact way to express the operations implied by list of statements whose variables are indexed the for loop contains three parts separated by two semicolons an initial condition an expression to check for the terminating condition an assignment to change the control variable the following is an example of for loop for        begin  procedural statements go here end the for loop statement repeats the execution of the procedural statements eight times the control variable is the initial condition is   and the loop is repeated as long as is less than  after each execution of the loop statement the value of is incremented by  description of two to four line decoder using for loop is shown in hdl example   since output is evaluated in procedural statement it must be declared as type reg the control variable for the loop is the integer when the loop is expanded unrolled  we get the following four conditions in and are in binary and the index for is in decimal  if in   then     else     if in   then     else     if in   then     else     if in   then     else     hdl example   decoder   description of   decoder using for loop statement module decoder in  input    in   two

synthesis logic synthesis is the automatic process by which computer based program e  synthesis tool transforms an hdl model of logic circuit into an optimized netlist of gates that perform the operations specified by the source code there are various target technologies that implement the synthesized design in hardware the effective use of an hdl description requires that designers adopt vendor specific style suitable for the particular synthesis tools the type of ics that implement the design may be an application specific integrated circuit asic  programmable logic device pld  or field programmable gate array fpga  logic synthesis is widely used in industry to design and implement large circuits efficiently correctly and rapidly logic synthesis tools interpret the source code of the hdl and translate it into an optimized gate structure accomplishing correctly all of the work that would be done by manual methods using karnaugh maps designs written in verilog or comparable language for the purpose of logic synthesis tend to be at the register transfer level this is because the hdl constructs used in an rtl description can be converted into gate level description in straightforward manner the following examples discuss how logic synthesizer can interpret an hdl construct and convert it into gate structure the continuous assignment assign statement is used to describe combinational circuits in an hdl it represents boolean equation for logic circuit continuous assignment with boolean expression for the right hand side of the assignment statement is synthesized into the corresponding gate circuit implementing the expression an expression with an addition operator   is interpreted as binary adder using full adder circuits an expression with subtraction operator  is converted into gate level subtractor consisting of full adders and exclusive or gates fig     statement with conditional operator such as assign   in   in  translates into two to one line multiplexer with control input and data inputs in  and in  statement with multiple conditional operators specifies larger multiplexer cyclic behavior always    may imply combinational or sequential circuit depending on whether the event control expression is level sensitive or edge sensitive synthesis tool will interpret as combinational logic level sensitive cyclic behavior whose event control expression is sensitive to every variable that is referenced within the behavior g  by the variables appearing in the right hand side of an assignment statement  the event control expression in description of combinational logic may not be sensitive to an edge of any signal for example always  in  or in  or   alternative  in  in  if y  in  else  in  translates into two to one line multiplexer as an alternative the case statement may be used to imply large multiplexers the casex statement treats the logic values and as dont cares when they appear in either the case expression or case item an edge sensitive cyclic behavior g  always  posedge clock  specifies synchronous clocked sequential circuit the implementation of the corresponding circuit consists of flip flops and the gates that implement the synchronous register transfer operations specified by the statements associated with the event control expression examples of such circuits are registers and counters sequential circuit description with case statement translates into control circuit with flip flops and gates that form the inputs to the flip flops thus each statement in an rtl description is interpreted by the synthesizer and assigned to corresponding gate and flip flop circuit for synthesizable sequential circuits the event control expression must be sensitive to the positive or the negative edge of the clock synchronizing signal  but not to both simplified flowchart of the process used by industry to design digital systems is shown in fig    the rtl description of the hdl design is simulated and checked for proper operation its operational features must match those given in the specification for the behavior of the circuit the test bench provides the stimulus signals to the simulator if the result of the simulation is not satisfactory the hdl description is corrected and checked again after the simulation run shows valid design the rtl description is ready to be compiled by the logic synthesizer all errors syntax and functional in the description must be eliminated before synthesis the synthesis tool generates netlist equivalent to gate level description of the design as it is represented by the model if the model fails to express the functionality of the specification the circuit will fail to do so also the gate level circuit is simulated with the same set of stimuli used to check the rtl design if any corrections are needed the process is repeated until satisfactory simulation is achieved the results of the two simulations are compared to see if they match if they do not the designer must change the rtl description to correct any errors in the design then the description is compiled again by the logic synthesizer to generate new gate level description once the designer is satisfied with the results of all simulation tests the design of the circuit is ready for physical implementation in technology in practice additional testing will be performed to verify that the timing specifications of the circuit can be met in the chosen hardware technology that issue is not within the scope of this text logic synthesis provides several advantages to the designer it takes less time to write an hdl description and synthesize gate level realization than it does to develop the circuit by manual entry from schematic diagrams the ease of changing the description facilitates exploration of design alternatives it is faster easier less expensive and less risky to check the validity of the design by simulation than it is to produce

digital system can be classified as either data or control information data are discrete elements of information binary words that are manipulated by performing arithmetic logic shift and other similar data processing operations these operations are implemented with digital hardware components such as adders decoders multiplexers counters and shift registers control information provides command signals that coordinate and execute the various operations in the data section of the machine in order to accomplish the desired data processing tasks the design of the logic of digital system can be divided into two distinct efforts one part is concerned with designing the digital circuits that perform the data processing operations the other part is concerned with designing the control circuits that determine the sequence in which the various manipulations of data are performed the relationship between the control logic and the data processing operations in digital system is shown in fig    the data processing path commonly referred to as the datapath unit manipulates data in registers according to the systems requirements the control unit issues sequence of commands to the datapath unit note that an internal feedback path from the datapath unit to the control unit provides status conditions that the control unit uses together with the external primary inputs to determine the sequence of control signals outputs of the control unit that direct the operation of the datapath unit well see later that understanding how to model this feedback relationship with an hdl is very important the control logic that generates the signals for sequencing the operations in the datapath unit is finite state machine fsm  e  synchronous sequential circuit the control commands for the system are produced by the fsm as functions of the primary inputs the status signals and the state of the machine in given state the outputs of the controller are the inputs to the datapath unit and determine the operations that it will execute depending on status conditions and other external inputs the fsm goes to its next state to initiate other operations the digital circuits that act as the control logic provide time sequence of signals for initiating the operations in the datapath and also determine the next state of the control subsystem itself input data input control unit control datapath signals fsm signals unit external status signals output data figure   control and datapath interaction section   algorithmic state machines asms   the control sequence and datapath tasks of digital system are specified by means of hardware algorithm an algorithm consists of finite number of procedural steps that specify how to obtain solution to problem hardware algorithm is procedure for solving the problem with given piece of equipment the most challenging and creative part of digital design is the formulation of hardware algorithms for achieving required objectives the goal is to implement the algorithms in silicon as an integrated circuit flowchart is convenient way to specify the sequence of procedural steps and decision paths for an algorithm flowchart for hardware algorithm translates the verbal instructions to an information diagram that enumerates the sequence of operations together with the conditions necessary for their execution an algorithmic state machine asm chart is flowchart that has been developed to specifically define algorithms for execution on digital hardware state machine is another term for sequential circuit which is the basic structure of digital system asm chart an asm chart resembles conventional flowchart but is interpreted somewhat differently conventional flowchart describes the procedural steps and decision paths of an algorithm in sequential manner without taking into consideration their time relationship the asm chart describes the sequence of events e  the ordering of events in time as well as the timing relationship between the states of sequential controller and the events that occur while going from one state to the next e  the events that are synchronous with changes in the state  the chart is adapted to specify accurately the control sequence and datapath operations in digital system taking into consideration the constraints of digital hardware an asm chart is composed of three basic elements the state box the decision box and the conditional box the boxes themselves are connected by directed edges indicating the sequential precedence and evolution of the states as the machine operates there are various ways to attach information to an asm chart in one state in the control sequence is indicated by state box as shown in fig    the shape of the state box is rectangle within which are written register operations or the names of output signals that the control generates while being in the indicated state the state is given symbolic name which is placed within the upper left corner of the box the binary code assigned to the state is placed at the upper right corner  the state symbol and code can be placed binary code   state name pause moore type output signals register operations start op a  figure   asm chart state box in other places as well  figure   gives an example of state box the state has the symbolic name pause and the binary code assigned to it is    inside the box is written the register operation d  which indicates that register is to be cleared to  the name start op inside the box indicates for example moore type output signal that is asserted while the machine is in state pause and that launches certain operation in the datapath unit the style of state box shown in fig   is sometimes used in asm charts but it can lead to confusion about when the register operation d  is to execute although the operation is written inside the state box it actually occurs when the machine makes transition from pause to its next state in fact writing the register operation within the state box is way albeit possibly confusing to indicate that the controller must assert signal that will cause the register operation to occur when the machine changes state later well introduce chart and notation that are more suited to digital design and that will eliminate any ambiguity about the register operations controlled by state machine the decision box of an asm chart describes the effect of an input e  primary or external input or status or internal signal on the control subsystem the box is diamond shaped and has two or more exit paths as shown in fig    the input condition to be tested is written inside the box one or the other exit path is taken depending on the evaluation of the condition in the binary case one path is taken if the condition is true and another when the condition is false when an input condition is assigned binary value the two paths are indicated by  and  respectively the state and decision boxes of an asm chart are similar to those used in conventional flowcharts the third element the conditional box is unique to the asm chart the shape of the conditional box is shown in fig    its rounded corners differentiate it from the state box the input path to the conditional box must come from one of the exit paths of decision box the outputs listed inside the conditional box are generated as mealy type signals during given state the register operations listed in the conditional box are associated with transition from the state figure   shows an example with conditional box the control generates the output signal start while in state  and checks the status of input flag if flag   then is cleared to  otherwise remains unchanged in either case the next state is  register operation is  condition  exit path  exit path exit path figure   asm chart decision box section   algorithmic state machines asms   binary code reset reset state name     moore type output signals   unconditional register operations start start  flag   flag  condition flush conditional     mealy outputs   and register g load g operations         figure   asm chart conditional box and examples associated with  we again note that this style of chart can be source of confusion because the state machine does not execute the indicated register operation d  when it is in  or the operation d gwhen it is in  the notation actually indicates that when the controller is in  it must assert mealy type signal that will cause the register operation d  to execute in the datapath unit  subject to the condition that flag   likewise in state  the controller must generate moore type output signal that causes the register operation d to execute in the datapath unit the operations in the datapath unit are synchronized to the clock edge that causes the state to move from  to  and from  to  respectively thus the control signal generated in given state affects the operation of register in the datapath when the next clock transition occurs the result of the operation is apparent in the next state the asm chart in fig   mixes descriptions of the datapath and the controller an asm chart for only the controller is shown in fig    in which the register operations are omitted in their place are the control signals that must be generated by the control unit to launch the operations of the datapath unit this chart is useful for describing the controller but it does not contain adequate information about the datapath  well address this issue later   if the path came from state box the asserted signals would be moore type signals dependent on only the state and should be listed within the box asm block an asm block is structure consisting of one state box and all the decision and conditional boxes connected to its exit path an asm block has one entrance and any number of exit paths represented by the structure of the decision boxes an asm chart consists of one or more interconnected blocks an example of an asm block is given in fig    associated with state  are two decision boxes and one conditional box the diagram distinguishes the block with dashed lines around the entire structure but this is not usually done since the asm chart uniquely defines each block from its structure state box without any decision or conditional boxes constitutes simple block each block in the asm chart describes the state of the system during one clock pulse interval e  the interval between two successive active edges of the clock  the operations within the state and conditional boxes in fig   are initiated by common clock pulse when the state of the controller transitions from  to its next state the same clock pulse transfers the system controller to one of the next states   or  as dictated by the binary values of and the asm chart for the controller alone is shown in fig    the moore type signal incr is asserted unconditionally while the machine is in  the mealy type signal clear is generated conditionally when the state is  and is asserted in general the moore type outputs of the controller are generated unconditionally and are indicated within state box the mealy type outputs are generated conditionally and are indicated in the conditional boxes connected to the edges that leave decision box the asm chart is similar to state transition diagram each state block is equivalent to state in sequential circuit the decision box is equivalent to the binary information reset reset       a incr e    clear f                    figure   asm blocks section   algorithmic state machines asms     ef    ef      figure   state diagram equivalent to the asm chart of fig   written along the directed lines that connect two states in state diagram as consequence it is sometimes convenient to convert the chart into state diagram and then use sequential circuit procedures to design the control logic as an illustration the asm chart of fig   is drawn as state diagram outputs are omitted in fig    the states are symbolized by circles with their binary values written inside the directed lines indicate the conditions that determine the next state the unconditional and conditional operations that must be performed in the datapath unit are not indicated in the state diagram simplifications binary decision box of an asm chart can be simplified by labeling only the edge corresponding to the asserted decision variable and leaving the other edge without label further simplification is to omit the edges corresponding to the state transitions that occur when reset condition is asserted output signals that are not asserted are not shown on the chart the presence of the name of an output signal indicates that it is asserted timing considerations the timing for all registers and flip flops in digital system is controlled by master clock generator the clock pulses are applied not only to the registers of the datapath but also to all the flip flops in the state machine implementing the control unit inputs are also synchronized to the clock because they are normally generated as outputs of another circuit that uses the same clock signals if the input signal changes at an arbitrary time independently of the clock we call it an asynchronous input asynchronous inputs may cause variety of problems to simplify the design we will assume that all inputs are synchronized with the clock and change state in response to an edge transition the major difference between conventional flowchart and an asm chart is in interpreting the time relationship among the various operations for example if fig   were conventional flowchart then the operations listed would be considered to follow one after another in sequence first register is incremented and only then is evaluated if   then register is cleared and control goes to state  otherwise if    the next step is to evaluate and go to state  or  in contrast an asm chart considers the entire block as one unit all the register operations that are specified within clock positive edge of clock present state next state     or  or  figure   transition between states the block must occur in synchronism at the edge transition of the same clock pulse while the system changes from  to the next state this sequence of events is presented pictorially in fig    in this illustration we assume positive edge triggering of all flip flops an asserted asynchronous reset signal reset transfers the control circuit into state  while in state  the control circuits check inputs and and generate appropriate signals accordingly if reset is not asserted the following operations occur simultaneously at the next positive edge of the clock   register is incremented   if   register is cleared   control transfers to the next state as specified in fig    note that the two operations in the datapath and the change of state in the control logic occur at the same time note also that the asm chart in fig   indicates the register operations that must occur in the datapath unit but does not indicate the control signal that is to be formed by the control unit conversely the chart in fig   indicates the control signals but not the datapath operations we will now present an asmd chart to provide the clarity and complete information needed by logic designers asmd chart algorithmic state machine and datapath asmd charts were developed to clarify the information displayed by asm charts and to provide an effective tool for designing control unit for given datapath unit an asmd chart differs from an asm chart in three important ways   an asmd chart does not list register operations within state box   the edges of an asmd chart are annotated with register operations that are concurrent with the state transition indicated by the edge and   an asmd chart includes conditional boxes identifying the signals which control the register operations that annotate the edges of the chart thus an asmd chart associates register operations with state transitions rather than with states it also associates register operations with the signals that cause them consequently an asmd chart represents partition of complex digital machine into its datapath and control units and clearly indicates the relationship between them there is no room for confusion about the timing of register operations or about the signals that launch them designers form an asmd chart in three step process that creates an annotated and completely specified asm chart for the controller of datapath unit section   design example asmd chart   the steps to form an asmd chart are   form an asm chart showing only the states of the controller and the input signals that cause state transitions   convert the asm chart into an asmd chart by annotating the edges of the asm chart to indicate the concurrent register operations of the datapath unit e  register operations that are concurrent with state transition  and  modify the asmd chart to identify the control signals that are generated by the controller and that cause the indicated operations in the datapath unit the asmd chart produced by this process clearly and completely specifies the finite state machine of the controller identifies the registers operations of the datapath unit identifies signals reporting the status of the datapath to the controller and links register operations to the signals that control them one important use of state machine is to control register operations on datapath in sequential machine that has been partitioned into controller and datapath an asmd chart links the asm chart of the controller to the datapath it controls in manner that serves as universal model representing all synchronous digital hardware design asmd charts help clarify the design of sequential machine by separating the design of its datapath from the design of the controller while maintaining clear relationship between the two units register operations that occur concurrently with state transitions are annotated on path of the chart rather than in state boxes or in conditional boxes on the path because these registers are not part of the controller the outputs generated by the controller are the signals that control the registers of the datapath and cause the register operations annotated on the asmd chart   design example asmd chart we will now present simple example demonstrating the use of the asmd chart and the register transfer representation we start from the initial specifications of system and proceed with the development of an appropriate asmd chart from which the digital hardware is then designed the datapath unit is to consist of two jk flip flops and and one four bit binary counter    the individual flip flops in are denoted by    and  with holding the most significant bit of the count signal start initiates the systems operation by clearing the counter and flip flop at each subsequent clock pulse the counter is incremented by  until the operations stop counter bits and determine the sequence of operations if    is cleared to  and the count continues if    is set to  then if    the count continues but if    is set to  on the next clock pulse and the system stops counting  in general the inputs to the control unit are external primary inputs and status signals that originate in the datapath unit then if start   the system remains in the initial state but if start   the operation cycle repeats block diagram of the systems architecture is shown in fig    with   the registers of the datapath unit   the external primary input signals   the status signals fed back from the datapath unit to the control unit and   the control signals generated by the control unit and input to the datapath unit note that the names of the control signals clearly indicate the operations that they cause to be executed in the datapath unit for example clr f clears registers and the name of the signal reset alternatively reset bar indicates that the reset action is active low the internal details of each unit are not shown asmd chart an asmd chart for the system is shown in fig   for asynchronous reset action and in fig   for synchronous reset action the chart shows the state transitions of the controller and the datapath operations associated with those transitions the chart is not in its final form for it does not identify the control signals generated by the controller the nonblocking verilog operator   is shown instead of the arrow   for register transfer operations because we will ultimately use the asmd chart to write verilog description of the system when the reset action is synchronous the transition to the reset state is synchronous with the clock this transition is shown for idle in the diagram but all other synchronous reset paths are omitted for clarity the system remains in the reset state idle until start is asserted when that happens e  start    the state moves to  at the next clock edge depending on the values of and  decoded in priority order  the state returns to  or goes to  from  it moves unconditionally to idle where it awaits another assertion of start the edges of the chart represent the state transitions that occur at the active e  synchronizing edge of the clock g  the rising edge and are annotated with the register operations that are to occur in the datapath with start asserted in idle the state will transition to  and the registers and will be cleared note that on the one hand if register operation is annotated on the edge leaving state box the operation occurs unconditionally and will be controlled by moore type signal for example register is incremented at every clock edge that occurs while the machine is in the state  on the other hand the register operation setting register annotates the edge leaving the decision box for  the signal controlling the operation will be mealy type signal asserted when the system is in state  and has the value  likewise the control signal clearing and is asserted conditionally the system is in state idle and start is asserted in addition to showing that the counter is incremented in state  the annotated paths show that other operations occur conditionally with the same clock edge either is cleared and control stays in state     or is set and control stays in state  a    or is set and control goes to state  a     section   design example asmd chart   status signals start controller datapath reset clr e clock set f set clr f incr a note denotes   reset a denotes   denotes nonblocking assignment

example asmd chart for controller state transitions asynchronous reset asmd chart for controller state transitions synchronous reset asmd chart for completely specified controller asynchronous reset when control is in state  moore type control signal must be asserted to set flip flop to  and the state returns to idle at the next active edge of the clock the third and final step in creating the asmd chart is to insert conditional boxes for the signals generated by the controller or to insert moore type signals in the state boxes as shown in fig    the signal clr f is generated conditionally in state idle incr is generated unconditionally in  clr and set are generated conditionally in  and set is generated unconditionally in  the asm chart has three states and three blocks the block associated with idle consists of the state box one decision box and one conditional box the block associated with  consists of only the state box in addition to clock and reset the control logic has one external input start and two status inputs and  in this example we have shown how verbal text description specification of design is translated into an asmd chart that completely describes the controller for the datapath indicating the control signals and their associated register operations this design example does not necessarily have practical application and in general depending on the interpretation the asmd chart produced by the three step design process for the controller may be simplified and formulated differently however once the asmd chart is established the procedure for designing the circuit is straightforward in practice designers use the asmd chart to write verilog models of the controller and the datapath and then synthesize circuit directly from the verilog description we will first design the system manually and then write the hdl description keeping synthesis as an optional step for those who have access to synthesis tools timing sequence every block in an asmd chart specifies the signals which control the operations that are to be initiated by one common clock pulse the control signals specified within the state and conditional boxes in the block are formed while the controller is in the indicated state and the annotated operations occur in the datapath unit when the state makes transition along an edge that exits the state the change from one state to the next is performed in the control logic in order to appreciate the timing relationship involved we will list the step by step sequence of operations after each clock edge beginning with an assertion of the signal start until the system returns to the reset initial state idle table   shows the binary values of the counter and the two flip flops after every clock pulse the table also shows separately the status of and  as well as the present state of the controller we start with state  right after the input signal start has caused the counter and flip flop to be cleared we will assume that the machine had been running before it entered idle instead of entering it from reset condition therefore the value of is assumed to be  because is set to  when the machine enters  before moving to idle as shown at the bottom of the table  and because does not change during the transition from idle to  the system stays in state  during the next  clock pulses each pulse increments the counter and either clears or sets note the relationship between the time at which becomes  and the time at section   design example asmd chart   table   sequence of operations for design example counter flip flops a a f conditions state                        idle                                                                                          which is set to  when  a a     the next  th clock pulse increments the counter to    but that same clock edge sees the value of as  so remains cleared the next  th pulse changes the counter from   to    and because is equal to  before the clock pulse arrives is set to  similarly is cleared to  not when the count goes from   to    but when it goes from   to    which is when is  in the present value of the counter when the count reaches    both and are equal to  the next clock edge increments by  sets to  and transfers control to state  control stays in  for only one clock period the clock edge associated with the path leaving  sets flip flop to  and transfers control to state idle the system stays in the initial state idle as long as start is equal to  from an observation of table   it may seem that the operations performed on are delayed by one clock pulse this is the difference between an asmd chart and conventional flowchart if fig   were conventional flowchart we would assume that is first incremented and the incremented value would have been used to check the status of  the operations that are performed in the digital hardware as specified by block in the asmd chart occur during the same clock cycle and not in sequence of operations following each other in time as is the usual interpretation in conventional flowchart thus the value of to be considered in the decision box is taken from the value of the counter in the present state and before it is incremented this is because the decision box for belongs with the same block as state  the digital circuits in the control unit generate the signals for all the operations specified in the present block prior to the arrival of the next clock pulse the next clock edge executes all the operations in the registers and flip flops including the flip flops in the controller that determine the next state using the present values of the output signals of the controller thus the signals that control the operations in the datapath unit are formed in the controller in the clock cycle control state preceding the clock edge at which the operations execute controller and datapath hardware design the asmd chart provides all the information needed to design the digital systemthe datapath and the controller the actual boundary between the hardware of the controller and that of the datapath can be arbitrary but we advocate first that the datapath unit contain only the hardware associated with its operations and the logic required perhaps to form status signals used by the controller and second that the control unit contain all of the logic required to generate the signals that control the operations of the datapath unit the requirements for the design of the datapath are indicated by the control signals inside the state and conditional boxes of the asmd chart and are specified by the annotations of the edges indicating datapath operations the control logic is determined from the decision boxes and the required state transitions the hardware configuration of the datapath and controller is shown in fig    note that the input signals of the control unit are the external primary inputs start reset and clock and the status signals from the datapath and  the status signals provide information about the present condition of the datapath this information together with the primary inputs and information about the present state of the machine is used to form the output of the controller and the value of the next state the outputs of the controller are inputs to the datapath and determine which operations will be executed when the clock undergoes transition note also that the state of the control unit is not an output of the control unit the control subsystem is shown in fig    with only its inputs and outputs with names matching those of the asmd chart the detailed design of the controller is considered subsequently the datapath unit consists of four bit binary counter and two jk flip flops the counter is similar to the one shown in fig    except that additional internal gates are required for the synchronous clear operation the counter is incremented with every clock pulse when the controller state is  it is cleared only when control is at state idle and start is equal to  the logic for the signal clr f will be included in the controller and requires an and gate to guarantee that both conditions are present similarly we can anticipate that the controller will use and gates to form signals set and clr depending on whether the controller is in state  and whether is asserted set controls flip flop and is asserted unconditionally during state  note that all flip flops and registers including the flip flops in the control unit use common clock section   design example asmd chart   design example

transfer representation digital system is represented at the register transfer level by specifying the registers in the system the operations performed and the control sequence the register operations and control information can be specified with an asmd chart it is convenient to separate the control logic from the register operations of the datapath the asmd chart provides this separation and clear sequence of steps to design controller for datapath the control information and register transfer operations can also be represented separately as shown in fig    the state diagram specifies the control sequence and the register operations are represented by the register transfer notation introduced in start   idle  a    start  a   s idle  clr f     incr a   if   then set e   if   then clr e  idle set f figure   register transfer level description of design example section   the state transition and the signal controlling the register operation are shown with the operation this representation is an alternative to the representation of the system described in the asmd chart of fig    only the asmd chart is really needed but the state diagram for the controller is an alternative representation that is useful in manual design the information for the state diagram is taken directly from the asmd chart the state names are specified in each state box the conditions that cause change of state are specified inside the diamond shaped decision boxes of the asmd chart and are used to annotate the state diagram the directed lines between states and the condition associated with each follow the same path as in the asmd chart the register transfer operations for each of the three states are listed following the name of the state they are taken from the state boxes or the annotated edges of the asmd chart state table the state diagram can be converted into state table from which the sequential circuit of the controller can be designed first we must assign binary values to each state in the asmd chart for flip flops in the control sequential circuit the asmd chart can accommodate up to states chart with  or  states requires sequential circuit with two flip flops with  to  states there is need for three flip flops each combination of flip flop values represents binary number for one of the states state table for controller is list of present states and inputs and their corresponding next states and outputs in most cases there are many dont care input conditions section   design example asmd chart   table   state table for the controller of fig    present inputs next outputs state state present state set clr symbol g start a g set clr f incr s idle    x       idle    x                                          x       that must be included so it is advisable to arrange the state table to take those conditions into consideration we assign the following binary values to the three states idle        and     binary state  is not used and will be treated as dont care condition the state table corresponding to the state diagram is shown in table   two flip flops are needed and they are labeled and  there are three inputs and five outputs the inputs are taken from the conditions in the decision boxes the outputs depend on the inputs and the present state of the control note that there is row in the table for each possible transition between states initial state  goes to state  or stays in   depending on the value of input start the other two inputs are marked with dont care xs as they do not determine the next state in this case while the system is in binary state  with start   the control unit provides an output labeled clr f to initiate the required register operations the transition from binary state  depends on inputs and  the system goes to binary state  only if a    otherwise it remains in binary state   finally binary state  goes to  independently of the input variables control logic the procedure for designing sequential circuit starting from state table was presented in chapter  if this procedure is applied to table   we need to use five variable maps to simplify the input equations this is because there are five variables listed under the present state and input columns of the table instead of using maps to simplify the input equations we can obtain them directly from the state table by inspection to design the sequential circuit of the controller with flip flops it is necessary to go over the next state columns in the state table and derive all the conditions that must set each flip flop to  from table   we note that the next state column of has single  in the fifth row the input of flip flop must be equal to  during present state  when both inputs and are equal to  this condition is expressed with the flip flop input equation dg   a similarly the next state column of has four and the condition for setting this flip flop is dg  start idle   to derive the five output functions we can exploit the fact that binary state  is not used which simplifies the equation for clr f and enables us to obtain the following simplified set of output equations set  a clr  a set   clr f  start idle incr   the logic diagram showing the internal detail of the controller of fig    is drawn in fig    note that although we derived the output equations from table   they can also be obtained directly by

example   manual design of controller for datapath using an asmd chart as starting point the fact that synthesis tools automatically execute these steps should be appreciated   hdl description of design example in previous chapters we gave examples of hdl descriptions of combinational circuits sequential circuits and various standard components such as multiplexers counters and registers we are now in position to incorporate these components into the description of specific design as mentioned previously design can be described either at the structural or behavioral level behavioral descriptions may be classified as being either at the register transfer level or at an abstract algorithmic level consequently we now consider three levels of design structural description rtl description and algorithmic based behavioral description the structural description is the lowest and most detailed level the digital system is specified in terms of the physical components and their interconnection the various components may include gates flip flops and standard circuits such as multiplexers and counters the design is hierarchically decomposed into functional units and each unit is described by an hdl module top level module combines the entire system by instantiating all the lower level modules this style of description requires that the designer have sufficient experience not only to understand the functionality of the system but also to implement it by selecting and connecting other functional elements the rtl description specifies the digital system in terms of the registers the operations performed and the control that sequences the operations this type of description simplifies the design process because it consists of procedural statements that determine the relationship between the various operations of the design without reference to any specific structure the rtl description implies certain hardware configuration among the registers allowing the designer to create design that can be synthesized automatically rather than manually into standard digital components the algorithmic based behavioral description is the most abstract level describing the function of the design in procedural algorithmic form similar to programming language it does not provide any detail on how the design is to be implemented with hardware the algorithmic based behavioral description is most appropriate for simulating complex systems in order to verify design ideas and explore trade offs descriptions at this level are accessible to nontechnical users who understand programming languages some algorithms however might not be synthesizable we will now illustrate the rtl and structural descriptions by using the design example of the previous section the design example will serve as model of coding style for future examples and will exploit alternative syntax options supported by revisions to the verilog language  an algorithmic based description is illustrated in section    rtl description the block diagram in fig    describes the design example an hdl description of the design example can be written as single rtl description in verilog module or as top level module having instantiations of separate modules for the controller and the datapath the former option simply ignores the boundaries between the functional units the modules in the latter option establish the boundaries shown in fig   and fig    we advocate the second option because in general it distinguishes more clearly between the controller and the datapath this choice also allows one to easily substitute alternative controllers for given datapath g  replace an rtl model by structural model  the rtl description of the design example is shown in hdl example   the description follows the asmd chart of fig    which contains complete description of the controller the datapath and the interface between them e  the outputs of the controller and the status signals  likewise our description has three modules design example rtl controller rtl and datapath rtl the descriptions of the controller and the datapath units are taken directly from fig    design example rtl declares the input and output ports of the module and instantiates controller rtl and datapath rtl at this stage of the description it is important to remember to declare as vector failure to do so will produce port mismatch errors when the descriptions are compiled together note that the status signals  and   but not  and   are passed to the controller the primary external inputs to the controller are start clock to synchronize the system  and reset the active low input signal reset is needed to initialize the state of the controller to idle without that signal the controller could not be placed in known initial state the controller is described by three cyclic always behaviors an edge sensitive behavior updates the state at the positive edge of the clock depending on whether reset condition is asserted two level sensitive behaviors describe the combinational logic for the next state and the outputs of the controller as specified by the asmd chart notice that the description includes default assignments to all of the outputs g  set    this approach allows the code of the case logic to be simplified by expressing only explicit assertions of the variables e  values are assigned by exception  the approach also ensures that every path through the assignment logic assigns value to every variable thus synthesis tool will interpret the logic to be combinational failure to assign value to every variable on every path of logic implies the need for transparent latch memory to implement the logic synthesis tools will provide the latch wasting silicon area the three states of the controller are given symbolic names and are encoded into binary values only three of the possible two bit patterns are used so the case statement for the next state logic includes default assignment to handle the possibility that one of the three assigned codes is not detected the alternative is to allow the hardware to make an arbitrary assignment to the next state next state  bx  also the first statement of the next state logic assigns next state  idle to guarantee that the next state is assigned in every thread of the logic this is precaution against accidentally forgetting to make an assignment to the next state in every thread of the logic with the result that the description implies the need for memory which synthesis tool will implement with transparent latch the description of datapath rtl is written by testing for an assertion of each control signal from controller rtl the register transfer operations are displayed in section   hdl description of design example   the asmd chart fig    note that nonblocking assignments are used with symbol   for the register transfer operations this ensures that the register operations and state transitions are concurrent feature that is especially crucial during control state  in this state is incremented by  and the value of    is checked to determine the operation to execute at register at the next clock to accomplish valid synchronous design it is necessary to ensure that  is checked before is incremented if blocking assignments were used one would have to place the two statements that check first and the statement that increments last however by using nonblocking assignments we accomplish the required synchronization without being concerned about the order in which the statements are listed the counter in datapath rtl is cleared synchronously because clr f is synchronized to the clock the cyclic behaviors of the controller and the datapath interact in chain reaction at the active edge of the clock the state and datapath registers are updated change in the state primary input or status input causes the level sensitive behaviors of the controller to update the value of the next state and the outputs the updated values are used at the next active edge of the clock to determine the state transition and the updates of the datapath note that the

example   testing the design description the sequence of operations for the design example was investigated in the previous section table   shows the values of and while register is incremented it is instructive to devise test that checks the circuit to verify the validity of the hdl description the test bench in hdl example   provides such module  the procedure for writing test benches is explained in section    the test module generates signals for start clock and reset and checks the results obtained from registers e and initially the reset signal is set to  to initialize the controller and start and clock are set to  at time   the reset signal is de asserted by setting it to  the start input is asserted by setting it to  and the clock is then repeated for  cycles the

they are marked with the symbol the first positive clock transition at time    clears and but does not affect so is unknown at this time the rest of the table is identical to table   note that since

clock cycle before the clock edge at which is set to  likewise set asserts during the clock cycle before the edge at which is set to  also clr f is formed in the cycle before and are cleared more thorough verification of design example rtl would confirm that the machine recovers from reset on the fly e  reset that is asserted randomly after the machine is operating  note that the signals in the output of the simulation have been listed in groups showing   clock and reset   start and the status inputs   the state   the control signals and   the datapath registers it is strongly recommended that the state always be displayed because this information is essential for verifying that the machine is operating correctly and for debugging its description when it is not for the chosen binary state code idle     s      and      structural description the rtl description of design consists of procedural statements that determine the functional behavior of the digital circuit

results for design example rtl hdl synthesis tools from which it is possible to obtain the equivalent gate level circuit of the design it is also possible to describe the design by its structure rather than its function structural description of design consists of instantiations of components that define the circuit elements and their interconnections in this regard structural description is equivalent to schematic diagram or block diagram of the circuit contemporary design practice relies heavily on rtl descriptions but we will present structural description here to contrast the two approaches for convenience the circuit is again decomposed into two parts the controller and the datapath the block diagram of fig    shows the high level partition between these units and fig    provides additional underlying structural details of the controller the structure of the datapath is evident in fig    and consists of the flip flops and the four bit counter with synchronous clear the top level of the verilog description replaces design example rtl controller rtl and datapath rtl by design example str controller str and datapath str respectively the descriptions of controller str and datapath str will be structural hdl example   presents the structural description of the design example it consists of nested hierarchy of modules and gates describing   the top level module design example str   the modules describing the controller and the datapath   the modules describing the flip flops and counters and   gates implementing the logic of the controller for simplicity the counter and flip flops are described by rtl models the top level module see fig    encapsulates the entire design by   instantiating the controller and the datapath modules   declaring the primary external input signals   declaring the output signals   declaring the control signals generated by the controller and connected to the datapath unit and   declaring the status signals generated by the datapath unit and connected to the controller the port list is identical to the list used in the rtl description the outputs are declared as wire type here because they serve merely to connect the outputs of the datapath module to the outputs of the top level module with their logic value being determined within the datapath module the control module describes the circuit of fig    the outputs of the two flip flops and are declared as wire data type and cannot be declared as reg data type because they are outputs of an instantiated flip flop dg and dg are undeclared identifiers e  implicit wires the name of variable is local to the module or procedural block in which it is declared nets may not be declared within procedural block g  begin    end  the rule to remember is that variable must be declared register type g  reg if and only if its value is assigned by procedural statement e  blocking or nonblocking assignment statement within procedural block in cyclic or single pass behavior or in the output of sequential udp  the instantiated gates specify the combinational part of the circuit there are two flip flop input equations and three output equations the outputs of the flip flops and and the input equations dg and dg replace output and input in the instantiated flip flops the flip flop is then described in the next module the structure of the datapath unit has

description was tested with the test bench that verified the rtl description to produce the results shown in fig    the only change necessary is the replacement of the instantiation of the example from design example rtl by design example str the simulation results for design example str matched those for design example rtl however comparison of the two descriptions indicates that the rtl style is easier section   sequential binary multiplier   to write and will lead to results faster if synthesis tools are available to automatically synthesize the registers the combinational logic and their interconnections   sequential binary multiplier this section introduces second design example it presents hardware algorithm for binary multiplication proposes the register configuration for its implementation and then shows how to use an asmd chart to design its datapath and its controller the system we will examine multiplies two unsigned binary numbers the hardware developed in section   to execute multiplication resulted in combinational circuit multiplier with many adders and and gates and requires large area of silicon as an integrated circuit in contrast in this section more efficient hardware algorithm results in sequential multiplier that uses only one adder and shift register the savings in hardware and silicon area come about from trade off in the space hardware ctime domain parallel adder uses more hardware but forms its result in one cycle of the clock sequential adder uses less hardware but takes multiple clock cycles to form its result the multiplication of two binary numbers is done with paper and pencil by successive e  sequential additions and shifting the process is best illustrated with numerical example let us multiply the two binary numbers    and         multiplican     multiplier                       product the process consists of successively adding and shifting copies of the multiplicand successive bits of the multiplier are examined least significant bit first if the multiplier bit is  the multiplicand is copied down otherwise  are copied down the numbers copied in successive lines are shifted one position to the left from the previous number finally the numbers are added and their sum forms the product the product obtained from the multiplication of two binary numbers of bits each can have up to bits it is apparent that the operations of addition and shifting are executed by the algorithm when the multiplication process is implemented with digital hardware it is convenient to change the process slightly first we note that in the context of synthesizing sequential machine the add and shift algorithm for binary multiplication can be executed in single clock cycle or over multiple clock cycles choice to form the product in the time span of single clock cycle will synthesize the circuit of parallel multiplier like the one discussed in section   on the other hand an rtl model of the algorithm adds shifted copies of the multiplicand to an accumulated partial product the values of the multiplier multiplicand and partial product are stored in registers and the operations of shifting and adding their contents are executed under the control of state machine among the many possibilities for distributing the effort of multiplication over multiple clock cycles we will consider that in which only one partial product is formed and accumulated in single cycle of the clock  one alternative would be to use additional hardware to form and accumulate two partial products in clock cycle but this would require more logic gates and either faster circuits or slower clock  instead of providing digital circuits to store and add simultaneously as many binary numbers as there are in the multiplier it is less expensive to provide only the hardware needed to sum two binary numbers and accumulate the partial products in register second instead of shifting the multiplicand to the left the partial product being formed is shifted to the right this leaves the partial product and the multiplicand in the required relative positions third when the corresponding bit of the multiplier is  there is no need to add all to the partial product since doing so will not alter its resulting value register configuration block diagram for the sequential binary multiplier is shown in fig     and the register configuration of the datapath is shown in fig     the multiplicand is stored in register the multiplier is stored in register and the partial product is formed in register and stored in and a parallel adder adds the contents of register to register the flip flop stores the carry after the addition the counter is initially set to hold binary number equal to the number of bits in the multiplier this counter is decremented after the formation of each partial product when the content of the counter reaches zero the product is formed in the double register and and the process stops the control logic stays in an initial state until start becomes  the system then performs the multiplication the sum of and forms the most significant bits of the partial product which is transferred to the output carry from the addition whether  or  is transferred to both the partial product in and the multiplier in are shifted to the right the least significant bit of is shifted into the most significant position of the carry from is shifted into the most significant position of and  is shifted into after the shift right operation one bit of the partial product is transferred into while the multiplier bits in are shifted one position to the right in this manner the least significant bit of register designated by   holds the bit of the multiplier that must be inspected next the control logic determines whether to add or not on the basis of this input bit the control logic also receives signal zero from circuit that checks counter for zero  and zero are status inputs for the control unit the input signal start is an external control input the outputs of the control logic launch the required operations in the registers of the datapath unit section   sequential binary multiplier   ready

add regs forms the sum of the multiplicand and register and decr decrements the counter the controller also forms output ready to signal to the host environment that the machine is ready to multiply the contents of the register holding the product vary during execution so it is useful to have signal indicating that its contents are valid note again that the state of the control is not an interface signal between the control unit and the datapath only the signals needed to control the datapath are included in the interface putting the state in the interface would require decoder in the datapath and would require wider and more active bus than the control signals alone not good asmd chart the asmd chart for the binary multiplier is shown in fig    the intermediate form in fig

                control logic the design of digital system can be divided into two parts the design of the register transfers in the datapath unit and the design of the control logic of the control unit the control logic is finite state machine its mealy and moore type outputs control the operations of the datapath the inputs to the control unit are the primary external inputs and the internal status signals fed back from the datapath to the controller the design of the system can be synthesized from an rtl description derived from the asmd chart alternatively manual design must derive the logic governing the inputs to the flip flops holding the state of the controller the information needed to form the state diagram of the controller is already contained in the asmd chart since the rectangular blocks that designate state boxes are the states of the sequential circuit the diamond shaped blocks that designate decision boxes determine the logical conditions for the next state transition in the state diagram and assertions of the conditional outputs as an example the control state diagram for the binary multiplier developed in the previous section is shown in fig    the information for the diagram is taken directly from the asmd chart of fig    the three states idle through shift are taken from the rectangular state boxes the inputs start and zero are taken from the diamond shaped decision boxes the register transfer operations for each of the three states are listed in fig    and are taken from the corresponding state and conditional boxes in the asmd chart establishing the state transitions is the initial focus so the outputs of the controller are not shown section   control logic   zero  start  idle start  add shift zero  state transition register

implementing the control logic   establish the required sequence of states and   provide signals to control the register operations the sequence of states is specified in the asmd chart or the state diagram the signals for controlling the operations in the registers are specified in the register transfer statements annotated on the asmd chart or listed in tabular format for the multiplier these signals are load regs for parallel loading the registers in the datapath unit  decr for decrementing the counter  add regs for adding the multiplicand and the partial product  and shift regs for shifting register caq  the block diagram of the control unit is shown in fig     the inputs to the controller are start   and zero and the outputs are ready load regs decr add regs and shift regs as specified in the asmd chart we note that  affects only the output of the controller not its state transitions the machine transitions from add to shift unconditionally an important step in the design is the assignment of coded binary values to the states the simplest assignment is the sequence of binary numbers as shown in table   another assignment is the gray code according to which only one bit changes when going from one number to the next state assignment often used in control design is the one hot assignment this assignment uses as many bits and flip flops as there are states in the circuit at any given time only one bit is equal to  the one that is hot table   state assignment for control state binary gray code one hot idle         add      shift  while all others are kept at  all cold  this type of assignment uses flip flop for each state indeed one hot encoding uses more flip flops than other types of coding but it usually leads to simpler decoding logic for the next state and the output of the machine because the decoding logic does not become more complex as states are added to the machine the speed at which the machine can operate is not limited by the time required to decode the state since the controller is sequential circuit it can be designed manually by the sequential logic procedure outlined in chapter  however in most cases this method is difficult to carry out manually because of the large number of states and inputs that typical control circuit may have as consequence it is necessary to use specialized methods for control logic design that may be considered as variations of the classical sequential logic method we will now present two such design procedures one uses sequence register and decoder and the other uses one flip flop per state the method will be presented for small circuit but it applies to larger circuits as well of course the need for these methods is eliminated if one has software that automatically synthesizes the circuit from an hdl description sequence register and decoder the sequence register and decoder manual method as the name implies uses register for the control states and decoder to provide an output corresponding to each of the states  the decoder is not needed if one hot code is used  register with flip flops can have up to states and an to line decoder has up to outputs an bit sequence register is essentially circuit with flip flops together with the associated gates that effect their state transitions the asmd chart and the state diagram for the controller of the binary multiplier have three states and two inputs  there is no need to consider   to implement the design with sequence register and decoder we need two flip flops for the register and two to four line decoder the outputs of the decoder will form the moore type outputs of the controller directly the mealy type outputs will be formed from the moore outputs and the inputs the state table for the finite state machine of the controller is shown in table   it is derived directly from the asmd chart of fig    or the state diagram of fig     we designate the two flip flops as and and assign the binary states     and  to idle add and shift respectively note that the input columns have dont care entries whenever the input variable is not used to determine the next table   inputs section   control logic   state table for control circuit next present state state present state ready load regs symbol g start  zero g decr add regs shift regs idle    x      idle add    x      add shift         shift           x         x       state the outputs of the control circuit are designated by the names given in the asmd chart the particular moore type output variable that is equal to  at any given time is determined from the equivalent binary value of the present state those output variables are shaded in table   thus when the present state is g    output ready must be equal to  while the other outputs remain at  since the moore type outputs are function of only the present state they can be generated with decoder circuit having the two inputs and and using three of the decoder outputs through  as shown in fig     which does not include the wiring for the state feedback the state machine of the controller can be designed from the state table by means of the classical procedure presented in chapter  this example has small number of states and inputs so we could use maps to simplify the boolean functions in most control logic applications the number of states and inputs is much larger in general the application of the classical method requires an excessive amount of work to obtain the simplified input equations for the flip flops and is prone to error the design can be simplified if we take into consideration the fact that the decoder outputs are available for use in the design instead of using flip flop outputs as the present state conditions we use the outputs of the decoder to indicate the present state condition of the sequential circuit moreover instead of using maps to simplify the flip flop equations we can obtain them directly by inspection of the state table for example from the next state conditions in the state table we find that the next state of is equal to  when the present state is add and is equal to  when the present state is idle or shift these conditions can be specified by the equation dg  where dg is the input of flip flop  similarly the input of is dg  start  zero start next state g ready  logic s idle load regs zero  add regs

control for binary multiplier using sequence register and decoder section   control logic   when deriving input equations by inspection from the state table we cannot be sure that the boolean functions have been simplified in the best possible way  synthesis tools take care of this detail automatically  in general it is advisable to analyze the circuit to ensure that the equations derived do indeed produce the required state transitions the logic diagram of the control circuit is drawn in fig     it consists of register with two flip flops and and    decoder the outputs of the decoder are used to generate the inputs to the next state logic as well as the control outputs the outputs of the controller should be connected to the datapath to activate the required register operations one hot design one flip flop per state another method of control logic design is the one hot assignment which results in sequential circuit with one flip flop per state only one of the flip flops contains  at any time all others are reset to  the single  propagates from one flip flop to another under the control of decision logic in such configuration each flip flop represents state that is present only when the control bit is transferred to it this method uses the maximum number of flip flops for the sequential circuit for example sequential circuit with  states requires minimum of four flip flops by contrast with the method of one flip flop per state the circuit requires  flip flops one for each state at first glance it may seem that this method would increase system cost since more flip flops are used but the method offers some advantages that may not be apparent one advantage is the simplicity with which the logic can be designed by inspection of the asmd chart or the state diagram no state or excitation tables are needed if type flip flops are employed the one hot method offers savings in design effort an increase in operational simplicity and possible decrease in the total number of gates since decoder is not needed the design procedure for one hot state assignment will be demonstrated by obtaining the control circuit specified by the state diagram of fig     since there are three states in the state diagram we choose three flip flops and label their outputs   and  corresponding to idle add and shift respectively the input equations for setting each flip flop to  are determined from the present state and the input conditions along the corresponding directed lines going into the state for example dg  the input to flip flop  is set to  if the machine is in state and start is not asserted or if the machine is in state and zero is asserted these conditions are specified by the input equation dg  start  zero in fact the condition for setting flip flop to  is obtained directly from the state diagram from the condition specified in the directed lines going into the corresponding flip flop state anded with the previous flip flop state if there is more than one directed line going into state all conditions must be ored using this procedure for the other three flip flops we obtain the remaining input equations dg  start  zero dg  start set ready idle load regs  zero add regs decr d  add rst shift regs shift clock reset rst figure   logic diagram for one hot state controller the logic diagram of the one hot controller with one flip flop per state is shown in fig    the circuit consists of three flip flops labeled through  together with the associated gates specified by the input equations initially flip flop must be set to  and all other flip flops must be reset to  so that the flip flop representing the initial state is enabled this can be done by using an asynchronous preset on flip flop and an asynchronous clear for the other flip flops once started the controller with one flip flop per state will propagate from one state to the other in the proper manner only one flip flop will be set to  with each clock edge all others are reset to  because their inputs are equal to    hdl description of binary multiplier second example of an hdl description of an rtl design is given in hdl example   the binary multiplier designed in section   for simplicity the entire description is flattened and encapsulated in one module comments will identify the controller and the datapath the first part of the description declares all of the inputs and outputs as specified section   hdl description of binary multiplier   in the block diagram of fig    the machine will be parameterized for five bit datapath to enable comparison between its simulation data and the result of the multiplication with the numerical example listed in table   the same model can be used for datapath having different size merely by changing the value of the parameters the second part of the description declares all registers in the controller and the datapath as well as the one hot encoding of the states the third part specifies implicit combinational logic continuous assignment statements for the concatenated register caq the zero status signal and the ready output signal the continuous assignments for zero and ready are accomplished by assigning boolean expression to their wire declarations the next section describes the control unit using single edge sensitive cyclic behavior to describe the state transitions and level sensitive cyclic behavior to describe the combinational logic for the next state and the outputs again note that default assignments are made to next state load regs decr add regs and shift regs the subsequent logic of the case statement assigns their value by exception the state transitions and the output logic are written directly from the asmd chart of fig     the datapath unit describes the register operations within separate edge sensitive cyclic behavior  for clarity separate cyclic behaviors are used we do not mix the description of the datapath with the description of the controller  each control input is decoded and is used to specify the associated operations the addition and subtraction operations will be implemented in hardware by combinational logic signal load regs causes the counter and the other registers to be loaded with their initial values etc because the controller and datapath have been partitioned into separate units the control signals completely specify the behavior of the datapath explicit information about the state of the controller is not needed and is not made available to the datapath unit the next state logic of the controller includes default case item to direct synthesis tool to map any of the unused codes to idle the default case item and the default assignments preceding the case statement ensure that the machine will recover if it somehow enters an unused state they also prevent unintentional synthesis of latches  remember synthesis tool will synthesize latches when what was intended to be combinational logic in fact fails to

of fig     it is naive to conclude that an hdl description of system is correct on the basis of the output it generates under the application of few input signals more strategic approach to testing and verification exploits the partition of the design into its datapath and control unit this partition supports separate verification of the controller and the datapath separate test bench can be developed to verify that the datapath executes each operation and generates status signals correctly after the datapath unit is verified the next step is to verify that each control signal is formed correctly by the control unit separate test bench can verify that the control unit exhibits the complete functionality specified by the asmd chart e  that it makes the correct state transitions and asserts its outputs in response to the external inputs and the status signals  verified control unit and verified datapath unit together do not guarantee that the system will operate correctly the final step in the design process is to integrate the verified models within parent module and verify the functionality of the overall machine the interface between the controller and the datapath must be examined in order to verify that the ports are connected correctly for example mismatch in the listed order of signals may not be detected by the compiler after the datapath unit and the control unit have been verified third test bench should verify the specified functionality of the complete system in practice this requires writing comprehensive test plan identifying that functionality for example the test plan would identify the need to verify that the sequential multiplier asserts the signal ready in state idle the exercise to write test plan is not academic the quality and scope of the test plan determine the worth of the verification effort the test plan guides the development of the test bench and increases the likelihood that the final design will match its specification testing and verifying an hdl model usually requires access to more information than the inputs and outputs of the machine knowledge of the state of the control unit the control signals the status signals and the internal registers of the datapath might all be necessary for debugging fortunately verilog provides mechanism to hierarchically de reference identifiers so that any variable at any level of the design hierarchy can be visible to the test bench procedural statements can display the information required to support efforts to debug the machine simulators use this mechanism to display waveforms of any variable in the design hierarchy to use the mechanism we reference the variable by its hierarchical path name for example the register within the datapath unit is not an output port of the multiplier but it can be referenced as p the hierarchical path name consists of the sequence of module identifiers or block names separated by periods and specifying the location of the variable in the design hierarchy we also note that simulators commonly have graphical user interface that displays all levels of the hierarchy of design the first test bench in hdl example   uses the system task strobe to display the result of the computations this task is similar to the display and monitor tasks explained in section    the strobe system task provides synchronization mechanism to ensure that data are displayed only after all assignments in given time step are executed this is very useful in synchronous sequential circuits where the time step begins at clock edge and multiple assignments may occur at the same time step of simulation when the system is synchronized to the positive edge of the clock using strobe after the always  posedge clock statement ensures that the display shows values of the signal after the clock pulse the test bench module sequential binary multiplier in hdl example   instantiates the module sequential binary multiplier of hdl example   both modules must be included as source files when simulating the multiplier with verilog hdl simulator the result of this simulation displays simulation log with numbers identical to the ones in

behavioral description of parallel multiplier structural modeling implicitly specifies the functionality of digital machine by prescribing an interconnection of gate level hardware units in this form of modeling synthesis tool performs boolean optimization and translates the hdl description of circuit into netlist of gates in particular technology g  cmos hardware design at this level often requires cleverness and accrued experience it is the most tedious and detailed form of modeling in contrast behavioral rtl modeling specifies functionality abstractly in terms of hdl operators the rtl model does not specify gate level implementation of the registers or the logic to control the operations that manipulate their contentsthose tasks are accomplished by synthesis tool rtl modeling implicitly schedules operations by explicitly assigning them to clock cycles the most abstract form of behavioral modeling describes only an algorithm without any reference to physical implementation set of resources or schedule for their use thus algorithmic modeling allows designer to explore trade offs in the space hardware and time domains trading processing speed for hardware complexity hdl example   presents an rtl model and an algorithmic model of binary multiplier both use level sensitive cyclic behavior the rtl model expresses the functionality of multiplier in single statement synthesis tool will associate with the multiplication operator gate level circuit equivalent to that shown in section   in simulation when either the multiplier or the multiplicand changes the product will be updated the time required to form the product will depend on the propagation delays of the gates available in the library of standard cells used by the synthesis tool the second model is an algorithmic description of the multiplier synthesis tool will unroll the loop of the algorithm and infer the need for gate level circuit equivalent to that shown in section   be aware that synthesis tool may not be able to synthesize given algorithmic description even though the associated hdl model will simulate and produce correct results one difficulty is that the sequence of operations implied by an algorithm might not be physically realizable in single clock cycle it then becomes necessary to distribute the operations over multiple clock cycles tool for synthesizing rtl logic will

successful in effect behavioral synthesis tool would have to allocate the registers and adders to implement multiplication if only single adder is to be shared by all of the operations that form partial sum the activity must be distributed over multiple clock cycles and in the correct sequence ultimately leading to the sequential binary multiplier for which we have explicitly designed the controller for its datapath behavioral synthesis tools require different and more sophisticated style of modeling and are not within the scope of this text    design with multiplexers the register and decoder scheme for the design of controller has three parts the flip flops that hold the binary state value the decoder that generates the control outputs and the gates that determine the next state and output signals in section    it was shown that combinational circuit can be implemented with multiplexers instead of individual gates replacing the gates with multiplexers results in regular pattern of three levels of components the first level consists of multiplexers that determine the next state of the register the second level contains register that holds the present binary state the third level has decoder that asserts unique output line for each control state these three components are predefined standard cells in many integrated circuits consider for example the asm chart of fig    consisting of four states and four control inputs we are interested in only the control signals governing the state sequence these signals are independent of the register operations of the datapath so the edges of the graph are not annotated with datapath register operations and the graph does not identify the output signals of the controller the binary assignment for each state is indicated at the upper right corner of the state boxes the decision boxes specify the state transitions as function of the four control inputs x and the three level control implementation shown in fig    consists of two multiplexers mux and mux  register with two flip flops and  and decoder with four outputsd    and  corresponding to    and  respectively the outputs of the state register flip flops are applied to the decoder inputs and also to the select inputs of the multiplexers in this way the present state of the register is used to select one of the inputs from each multiplexer the outputs of the multiplexers are then applied to the inputs of and  the purpose of each multiplexer is to produce an input to its corresponding flip flop equal to the binary value of that bit of the next state vector the inputs of the multiplexers                      figure   example of asm chart with four control inputs are determined from the decision boxes and state transitions given in the asm chart for example state  stays at  or goes to   depending on the value of input since the next state of is  in either case we place signal equivalent to logic  in mux input  the next state of is  if   and  if   since the next state of is equal to we apply control input to mux input  this means that when the select inputs of the multiplexers are equal to present state   the outputs of the multiplexers provide the binary value that is transferred to the register at the next clock pulse section   design with multiplexers     d   mux   s d   mux select decoder d s d  x  mux  y  clk figure   control implementation with multiplexers to facilitate the evaluation of the multiplexer inputs we prepare table showing the input conditions for each possible state transition in the asm chart table   gives this information for the asm chart of fig    there are two transitions from present state  or  and three from present state  or   the sets of transitions are separated by horizontal lines across the table the input conditions listed in the table are obtained from the decision boxes in the asm chart for example from fig    we note that present state  will go to next state  if   or to next state  if   in the table we mark these input conditions as and respectively the two columns under multiplexer inputs in the table specify the input values that must be applied to mux and mux  the multiplexer input for each present state is determined from the input conditions when the next state of the flip flop is equal to  thus after present state   the next state of is always equal to  and the next state of is equal to the complement of therefore the input of mux is made equal to  and that of mux to xwhen the present state of the register is   as another example after present state   the next state of must be equal to  if the input conditions are yz or yz when these two boolean terms are ored together and then simplified we obtain the single binary variable as indicated in the table the next state of is equal to  if the input conditions are yz    if the next state of remains at  after given present state we place  in the multiplexer input as shown in present state  for table   multiplexer input conditions present next input inputs mux state state condition x g g mux                           yz     yz yz  yz  yz     yz         yz  yz   yz  yz  mux  if the next state of is always  we place  in the multiplexer input as shown in present state  for mux  the other entries for mux and mux are derived in similar manner the multiplexer inputs from the table are then used in the control implementation of fig    note that if the next state of flip flop is function of two or more control variables the multiplexer may require one or more gates in its input otherwise the multiplexer input is equal to the control variable the complement of the control variable   or  design example count the number of ones in register we will demonstrate the multiplexer implementation of the logic for control unit by means of design examplea system that is to count the number of in word of data the example will also demonstrate the formulation of the asmd chart and the implementation of the datapath subsystem from among various alternatives we will consider ones counter consisting of two registers and  and flip flop  more efficient implementation is considered in the problems at the end of the chapter  the system counts the number of in the number loaded into register and sets register to that number for example if the binary number loaded into is      the circuit counts the five in and sets register to the binary count   this is done by shifting each bit from register one at time into flip flop the value in is checked by the control and each time it is

of the controller and the datapath the listing of code includes the lower level modules implementing their structures note that the datapath unit does not have reset signal to clear the registers but the models for the flip flop shift register and counter have an active low reset this illustrates the use of verilog data type supply to hardwire those ports to logic value  in their instantiation within datapath str note also that the test bench uses hierarchical de referencing to access the state of the controller to make the debug and verification tasks easier without having to alter the

of simulation but we will consider one that typically happens in hdl based design methodology three realities contribute to the potential problem   physical feedback path exists between datapath unit and control unit whose inputs include status signals fed back from the datapath unit   blocked procedural assignments execute immediately and behavioral models simulate with  propagation delays effectively creating immediate changes in the outputs of combinational logic when its inputs change e  changes in the inputs and the outputs are scheduled in the same time step of the simulation  and   the order in which simulator executes multiple blocked assignments to the same variable at given time step of the simulation is indeterminate e  unpredictable  now consider sequential machine with an hdl model in which all assignments are made with the blocked assignment operator at clock pulse the register operations in the datapath the state transitions in the controller the updates of the next state and output logic of the controller and the updates to the status signals in the datapath are all scheduled to occur at the same time step of the simulation which executes first suppose that when clock pulse occurs the state of the controller changes before the register operations execute the change in the state could change the outputs of the control unit the new values of the outputs would be used by the datapath when it finally executes its assignments at that same clock pulse the result might not be the same as it would have been if the datapath had executed its assignments before the control unit updated its state and outputs conversely suppose that when the clock pulse occurs the datapath unit executes its operations and updates its status signals first the updated status signals could cause change in the value of the next state of the controller which would be used to update the state the result could differ from that which would result if the state had been updated before the edge sensitive operations in the datapath executed in either case the timing of register transfer operations and state transitions in the different representations of the system might not match failing to detect mismatch can have disastrous consequences for the user of the design finding the source of the mismatch can be very time consuming and costly it is better to avoid the mismatch by following strict discipline in your design fortunately there is solution to this dilemma designer can eliminate the software race conditions just described by observing the rule of modeling combinational logic with blocked assignments and modeling state transitions and edge sensitive register operations with nonblocking assignments software race cannot happen if nonblocking operators are used as shown in all of the examples in this text because the sampling mechanism of the nonblocking operator breaks the feedback path between state transition or edge sensitive datapath operation and the combinational logic that forms the next state or inputs to the registers in the datapath unit the mechanism does this because simulators evaluate the expressions on the right hand side of their nonblocking assignment statements before any blocked assignments are made thus the nonblocking assignments cannot be affected by the results of the blocked assignments this matches the hardware reality always use the blocking operator to model combinational logic and use the nonblocking operator to model edge sensitive register operations and state transitions it also might appear that the physical structure of datapath and the controller together create physical e  hardware  race condition because the status signals are fed back to the controller and the outputs of the controller are fed forward to the datapath however timing analysis can verify that change in the output of the controller will not propagate through the datapath logic and then through the input logic of the controller in time to have an effect on the output of the controller until the next clock pulse the state cannot update until the next edge of the clock even though the status signals update the value of the next state the flip flop cuts the feedback path section   latch free design why waste silicon    between clock cycles in practice timing analysis verifies that the circuit will operate at the specified clock frequency or it identifies signal paths whose propagation delays are problematic remember the design must implement the correct logic and operate at the speed prescribed by the clock    latch free design why waste silicon  continuous assignments model combinational logic implicitly feedback free continuous assignment will synthesize to combinational logic and the inputcoutput relationship of the logic is automatically sensitive to all of the inputs of the circuit in simulation the simulator monitors the right hand sides of all continuous assignments detects change in any of the referenced variables and updates the left hand side of an affected assignment statement unlike continuous assignment cyclic behavior is not necessarily completely sensitive to all of the variables that are referenced by its assignment statements if level sensitive cyclic behavior is used to describe combinational logic it is essential that the sensitivity list include every variable that is referenced on the right hand side of an assignment statement in the behavior if the list is incomplete the logic described by the behavior will be synthesized with latches at the outputs of the logic this implementation wastes silicon area and may have mismatch between the simulation of the behavioral model and the synthesized circuit these difficulties can be avoided by ensuring that the sensitivity list is complete but in large circuits it is easy to fail to include every referenced variable in the sensitivity list of level sensitive cyclic behavior consequently verilog   included new operator to reduce the risk of accidentally synthesizing latches in verilog    the tokens  and  can be combined as  or   and are used without sensitivity list to indicate that execution of the associated statement is sensitive to every variable that is referenced on the right hand side of an assignment statement in the logic in effect the operator  indicates that the logic is to be interpreted hdl example   the following level sensitive cyclic behavior will synthesize two channel multiplexer module mux    output reg     input     b input sel  always   sel  b endmodule the cyclic behavior has an implicit sensitivity list consisting of b and sel and synthesized as level sensitive combinational logic the logic has an implicit sensitivity list composed of all of the variables that are referenced by the procedural assignments using the  operator will prevent accidental synthesis of latches    other language features the examples in this text have used only those features of the verilog hdl that are appropriate for an introductory course in logic design verilog   contains features that are very useful to designers but which are not considered here among them are multidimensional arrays variable part selects array bit and part selects signed reg net and port declarations and local parameters these enhancements are treated in more advanced texts using verilog

lower clock rate converting data from parallel format to serial format in the process in the datapath shown entire words of data can be transferred into the pipeline at twice the rate at which the contents of the pipeline must be dumped into holding register or consumed by some processor the contents of the holding register can be shifted out serially to accomplish an overall parallel to serial conversion of the data stream the asmd chart indicates that the machine has synchronous reset to idle where it waits until rst is de asserted and en is asserted note that synchronous transitions which would occur from the other states to idle under the action of rst are not shown with en asserted the machine transitions from idle to  accompanied by concurrent register operations that load the msbyte of the pipe with data and move the content of to the lsbyte  at the next clock the state goes to full and now the pipe is full if ld is asserted at the next clock the machine moves to  while

the digital circuits presented in the experiments if an fpga prototyping board is available the experiments can be implemented in an fpga as an alternative to standard ics logic breadboard suitable

variable clock power supply and ic socket strips some experiments may require additional switches lamps or ic socket strips extended breadboards with more solderless sockets and plug in switches and lamps may be needed additional equipment required is dual trace oscilloscope for experiments     and   logic probe to be used for debugging and number of ics the ics required for the experiments are of the ttl or cmos series    the integrated circuits to be used in the experiments can be classified as small scale integration ssi or medium scale integration msi circuits ssi circuits contain individual gates or flip flops and msi circuits perform specific digital functions the eight ssi gate ics needed for the experimentstwo input nand nor and or and xor gates inverters and three input

ground  these are the supply terminals which must be connected to power supply of  for proper operation of the circuit each ic is recognized by its identification number for example the two input nand gates are found inside the ic whose number is    detailed descriptions of the msi circuits can be found in data books published by the manufacturers the best way to acquire experience with commercial msi circuit is to study its description in data book that provides complete information on the internal external and electrical characteristics of integrated circuits various semiconductor companies publish data books for the   series the msi circuits that are needed for the experiments are introduced and explained when they are used for the first time the operation of the circuit is explained by referring to similar circuits in previous chapters the information given in this chapter about the msi circuits should be sufficient for performing the experiments adequately nevertheless reference to data book will always be preferable as it gives more detailed description of the circuits we will now demonstrate the method of presentation of msi circuits adopted here to illustrate we introduce the ripple counter ic type    this ic is used in experiment  and in subsequent experiments to generate sequence of binary numbers for verifying the operation of combinational circuits the information about the   ic that is found in data book is shown in figs   and  part shows diagram of the internal logic circuit and its connection to external pins all inputs and outputs are given symbolic letters and assigned to pin numbers part shows the physical layout of the ic together with its  pin assignment to signal names some of the pins are not used by the circuit and are marked as nc no connection  the ic is inserted into socket and wires are connected to the various pins through the socket terminals when drawing schematic diagrams in this chapter we will show the ic in block diagram form as in fig    the ic number here    is written inside the block all input terminals are placed on the left of the block and all output terminals on the right the letter symbols of the signals such as r  and qa are written inside the block and the corresponding pin numbers such as    and   are written along the external lines vcc and gnd are the power terminals connected to pins  and   the size of the

of the block for convenience the operation of the circuit is similar to the ripple counter shown in fig   with an asynchronous clear to each flip flop when input or or both are equal to logic  ground  all asynchronous clears are equal to  and are disabled to clear all four flip flops to  the output of the nand gate must be equal to  this is accomplished by having both inputs and at logic  about   note that the and inputs show no connections it is characteristic of ttl circuits that an input terminal with no external connections has the effect of producing signal equivalent to logic  note also that output qa is not connected to input internally the   ic can operate as three bit counter using input and flip flops qb qc and qd it can operate as four bit counter using input if output qa is connected to input therefore to operate the circuit as four bit counter it is necessary to have an external connection between pin  and pin  the reset inputs and  at pins  and  respectively must be grounded pins  and  must be connected to  power supply the input pulses must be applied to input at pin   and the four flip flop outputs of the counter are taken from qa qb qc and qd at pins      and   respectively with qa being the least significant bit figure   demonstrates the way that all msi circuits will be symbolized graphically in this chapter only block diagram similar to the one shown in

experiment  binary and decimal numbers this experiment demonstrates the count sequence of binary numbers and the binary coded decimal bcd representation it serves as an introduction to the breadboard used in the laboratory and acquaints the student with the cathode ray oscilloscope reference material from the text that may be useful to know while performing the experiment can be found in section   on binary numbers and section   on bcd numbers binary count ic type   consists of four flip flops as shown in fig    they can be connected to count in binary or in bcd connect the ic to operate as four bit binary counter by wiring the external terminals as shown in fig   this is done by connecting wire from pin   output qa to pin  input  input at pin  is connected to pulser that provides single pulses the two reset inputs and  are connected to ground the four outputs go to four indicator lamps with the low order bit of the counter from qa connected to the rightmost indicator lamp do not forget to supply  and ground to the ic all connections should be made with the power supply in the off position turn the power on and observe the four indicator lamps the four bit number in the output is incremented by  for every pulse generated in the push button pulser the count goes to binary  and then back to  disconnect the input of the counter at pin  from the pulser and connect it to clock generator that produces train of pulses at low frequency of about  pulse per second this will provide an automatic binary count note that the binary counter will be used in subsequent experiments to provide the input binary signals for testing combinational circuits push button     pulser or vcc qa clock    qb  gnd   qc    qd indicator lamps figure   binary counter oscilloscope display increase the frequency of the clock to  khz or higher and connect its output to an oscilloscope observe the clock output on the oscilloscope and sketch its waveform using dual trace oscilloscope connect the output of qa to one channel and the output of the clock to the second channel note that the output of qa is complemented every time the clock pulse goes through negative transition from  to  note also that the clock frequency at the output of the first flip flop is one half that of the input clock frequency each flip flop in turn divides its incoming frequency by  the four bit counter divides the incoming frequency by  at output qd obtain timing diagram showing the relationship of the clock to the four outputs of the counter make sure that you include at least  clock cycles the way to proceed with dual trace oscilloscope is as follows first observe the clock pulses and qa and record their timing waveforms then repeat by observing and recording the waveforms of qa together with qb followed by the waveforms of qb with qc and then qc with qd your final result should be diagram showing the relationship of the clock to the four outputs in one composite diagram having at least  clock cycles bcd count the bcd representation uses the binary numbers from   to   to represent the coded decimal digits from  to  ic type   can be operated as bcd counter by making the external connections shown in fig    outputs qb and qd are connected to the two reset inputs and  when both and are equal to  all four cells in the counter clear to  irrespective of the input pulse the counter starts from  and every input pulse increments it by  until it reaches the count of    the next pulse changes the ouput to    making qb and qd equal to  this momentary output cannot be section   experiment  binary and decimal numbers   input     pulses vcc qa    qb  gnd   qc    qd figure   bcd counter sustained because the four cells immediately clear to  with the result that the output goes to   thus the pulse

goes from   to    disconnect the input from the pulser and connect it to clock generator observe the clock waveform and the four outputs on the oscilloscope obtain an accurate timing diagram showing the relationship between the clock and the four outputs make sure to include at least  clock cycles in the oscilloscope display and in the composite timing diagram output pattern when the count pulses into the bcd counter are continuous the counter keeps repeating the sequence from   to   and back to    this means that each bit in the four outputs produces fixed pattern of and that is repeated every  pulses these patterns can be predicted from list of the binary numbers from   to    the list will show that output qa being the least significant bit produces pattern of alternate and output qd being the most significant bit produces pattern of eight followed by two obtain the pattern for the other two outputs and then check all four patterns on the oscilloscope this is done with dual trace oscilloscope by displaying the clock pulses in one channel and one of the output waveforms in the other channel the pattern of and for the corresponding output is obtained by observing the output levels at the vertical positions where the pulses change from  to  other counts ic type   can be connected to count from  to variety of final counts this is done by connecting one or two outputs to the reset inputs and thus if is connected to qa instead of to qb in fig    the resulting count will be from   to    which is  less than    qd   and qa    utilizing your knowledge of how and affect the final count connect the   ic to count from   to the following final counts           connect each circuit and verify its count sequence by applying pulses from the pulser and observing the output count in the indicator lamps if the initial count starts with value greater than the final count keep applying input pulses until the output clears to    experiment  digital logic gates in this

following nand gates    two input nand   inverter one input nand    three input nand   four input nand if an input to nand gate is not used it should not be left open but instead should be connected to another input that is used for example if the circuit needs an inverter and there is an extra two input gate available in   ic then both inputs of the gate are to be connected together to form single input for an inverter logic diagram this part of the experiment starts with given logic diagram from which we proceed to apply simplification procedures to reduce the number of gates and possibly the number of ics the logic diagram shown in fig   requires two icsa   and    note that the inverters for inputs y and are obtained from the remaining three gates in the   ic if the inverters were taken from   ic the circuit would have required three ics note also that in drawing ssi circuits the gates are not enclosed in blocks as is done with msi circuits assign pin numbers to all inputs

of engagement in the first the circuits that are specified in the hands on laboratory experiments can be described simulated and verified using verilog and simulator in the second if suitable fpga

identity of the individual structural hardware units g   bit counter can be preserved by encapsulating them in separate verilog modules whose internal detail is described behaviorally or by mixture of behavioral and structural models prototyping circuit with an fpga requires synthesizing verilog description to produce bit stream that can be downloaded to configure the internal resources g  clbs of xilinx fpga and connectivity of the fpga three details require attention   the pins of the prototyping board are connected to the pins of the fpga and the hardware implementation of the synthesized circuit requires that its input and output signals be associated with the pins of the prototyping board this association is made using the synthesis tool provided by the vendor of the fpga such tools are available free    fpga prototyping boards have clock generator but it will be necessary in some cases to implement clock divider in verilog to obtain an internal clock whose frequency is suitable

chapter  standard graphic symbols   rectangular shape symbols digital components such as gates decoders multiplexers and registers are available commercially in integrated circuits and are classified as ssi or msi circuits standard graphic symbols have been developed for these and other components so that the user can recognize each function from the unique graphic symbol assigned to it this standard known as ansi ieee std      has been approved by industry government and professional organizations and is consistent with international standards the standard uses rectangular shape outline to represent each particular logic function within the outline there is general qualifying symbol denoting the logical operation performed by the unit for example the general qualifying symbol for multiplexer is mux the size of the outline is arbitrary and can be either square or rectangular shape with an arbitrary lengthcwidth ratio input lines are placed on the left and output lines are placed on the right if the direction of signal flow is reversed it must be indicated by arrows the rectangular shape graphic symbols for ssi gates are shown in fig    the qualifying symbol for the and gate is the ampersand   the or gate has the qualifying symbol that designates greater than or equal to  indicating that at least one input must be active for the output to be active the symbol for the buffer gate is  showing that only one input is present the exclusive or symbol designates the fact that only one input must be active for the output to be active the inclusion of the logic negation small circle in the output converts the gates to their complement values although the rectangular shape symbols for the gates are recommended the standard also recognizes the distinctive shape symbols for the gates shown in fig    an example of an msi standard graphic symbol is the four bit parallel adder shown in fig    the qualifying symbol for an adder is the greek letter  the preferred

equivalents of the weights of the bits to the power of  thus the input labeled  corresponds to the value of     the input carry is designated by ci and the output carry by co when the digital component represented by the outline is also commercial integrated circuit it is customary to write the ic pin number along each input and output thus ic type   is four bit adder with look ahead carry it is enclosed in package with  pins the pin numbers for the nine inputs and five outputs are shown in fig    the other two pins are for the power supply before introducing the graphic symbols of other components it is necessary to review some terminology as mentioned in section   positive logic system defines the more positive of two signal levels designated by as logic  and the more negative signal level designated by as logic  negative logic assumes the opposite assignment third alternative is to employ mixed logic convention where the signals are considered entirely in terms of their and values at any point in the circuit the user is allowed to define the logic polarity by assigning logic  to either the or signal the mixed logic notation uses small right angle triangle graphic symbol to designate negative logic polarity at any input or output terminal  see fig     integrated circuit manufacturers specify the operation of integrated circuits in terms of and signals when an input or output is considered in terms of positive logic it is defined as active high when it is considered in terms of negative logic it is defined as active low active low inputs or outputs are recognized by the presence of the small triangle polarity indicator symbol when positive logic is used exclusively throughout the entire system the small triangle polarity symbol is equivalent to the small circle that designates negation in this book we have assumed positive logic throughout and employed the small circle when drawing logic diagrams when an input or output line does not include the small circle we define it to be active if it is logic  an input or output that includes the small circle symbol is considered active if it is in the logic  state however we will use the small triangle polarity symbol to indicate active low assignment in all drawings that represent standard diagrams this will conform with integrated circuit data books where the polarity symbol is usually employed note that the bottom four gates in fig    could have been drawn with small triangle in the output lines instead of small circle another example of graphic symbol for an msi circuit is shown in fig    this is  to  line decoder representing one half of ic type    inputs are on the left and outputs on the right the identifying symbol y indicates that the circuit converts from code to code data inputs and are assigned binary weights  and  equivalent to  and   respectively the outputs are assigned numbers from  to  corresponding to outputs through  respectively the decoder has one active low input and one active high input  these two inputs go through an internal and  y     b       e  en    figure   standard graphic symbol for  to  line decoder one half of ic type    section   qualifying

symbols for logic functions provide list of qualifying symbols to be used in conjunction with the outline qualifying symbol is added to the basic outline to designate the overall logic characteristics of the element or the physical characteristics of an input or output table   lists some of the general qualifying symbols specified in the standard general qualifying symbol defines the basic function performed by the device represented in the diagram it is placed near the top center position of the rectangular shape outline the general qualifying symbols for the gates decoder and adder were shown in previous diagrams the other symbols are self explanatory and will be used later in diagrams representing the corresponding digital elements some of the qualifying symbols associated with inputs and outputs are shown in fig    symbols associated with inputs are placed on the left side of the column labeled symbol symbols associated with outputs are placed on the right side of the column the

countup countdown ct  contents of register equals binary  figure   qualifying symbols associated with inputs and outputs section   dependency notation   previously it is equivalent to the logic negation when positive logic is assumed the dynamic input is associated with the clock input in flip flop circuits it indicates that the input is active on transition from low to high level signal the three state output has third high impedance state which has no logic significance when the circuit is enabled the output is in the normal  or  logic state but when the circuit is disabled the three state output is in high impedance state this state is equivalent to an open circuit the open collector output has one state that exhibits high impedance condition an externally connected resistor is sometimes required in order to produce the proper logic level the diamond shape symbol may have bar on top for high type or on the bottom for low type  the high or low type specifies the logic level when the output is not in the high impedance state for example ttl type integrated circuits have special outputs called open collector outputs these outputs are recognized by diamond shape symbol with bar under it this indicates that the output can be either in high impedance state or in low level state when used as part of distribution function two or more open collector nand gates when connected to common resistor perform positive logic and function or negative logic or function the output with special amplification is used in gates that provide special driving capabilities such gates are employed in components such as clock drivers or bus oriented transmitters the en symbol designates an enable input it has the effect of enabling all outputs when it is active when the input marked with en is inactive all outputs are disabled the symbols for flip flop inputs have the usual meaning the input is also associated with other storage elements such as memory input the symbols for shift right and shift left are arrows pointing to the right or the left respectively the symbols for count up and count down counters are the plus and minus symbols respectively an output designated by ct   will be active when the contents of the register reach the binary count of   when nonstandard information is shown inside the outline it is enclosed in square brackets like this    dependency notation the most important aspect of the standard logic symbols is the dependency notation dependency notation is used to provide the means of denoting the relationship between different inputs or outputs without actually showing all the elements and interconnections between them we will first demonstrate the dependency notation with an example of the and dependency and then define all the other symbols associated with this notation the and dependency is represented with the letter followed by number any input or output in diagram that is labeled with the number associated with is considered to be anded with it for example if one input in the diagram has the label and another input is labeled with the number  then the two inputs labeled and  are considered to be anded together internally an example of and dependency is shown in fig    in  we have portion of graphic symbol with two and dependency labels and  there are two inputs labeled with the number  and one input labeled with the number  the equivalent y  g y    c   block with and c equivalent interpretation figure   example of and dependency interpretation is shown in part of the figure input associated with is considered to be anded with inputs and which are labeled with  similarly input is anded with input to conform with the dependency between and  the standard defines  other dependencies each dependency is denoted by letter symbol except en  the letter appears at the input or output and is followed by number each input or output affected by that dependency is labeled with that same number the  dependencies and their corresponding letter designation are as follows denotes an and gate relationship denotes an or relationship denotes negate exclusive or relationship en specifies an enable action identifies control dependency specifies setting action specifies resetting action identifies mode dependency identifies an address dependency section   symbols for combinational elements   indicates an internal interconnection indicates controlled transmission the and dependencies are used to denote the boolean relationships of or and exclusive or similar to the that denotes the boolean and the en dependency is similar to the qualifying symbol en except that number follows it for example en   only the outputs marked with that number are disabled when the input associated with en is active the control dependency is used to identify clock input in sequential element and to indicate which input is controlled by it the set and reset dependencies are used to specify internal logic states of an sr flip flop the s and dependencies are explained in section   in conjunction with the flip flop circuit the mode dependency is used to identify inputs that select the mode of operation of the unit the mode dependency is presented in section   in conjunction with registers and counters the address dependency is used to identify the address input of memory it is introduced in section   in conjunction with the memory unit the dependency is used to indicate interconnections inside the unit it signifies the existence of internal logic connections between inputs outputs internal inputs and internal outputs in any combination the dependency is used to indicate the controlled transmission path in cmos transmission gate    symbols for combinational elements the examples in this section and the rest of this chapter illustrate the use of the standard in representing various digital components with graphic symbols the examples demonstrate actual commercial integrated circuits with the pin numbers included in the inputs and outputs most of the ics presented in this chapter are included with the suggested experiments outlined in chapter  the graphic symbols for the adder and decoder were shown in section    ic type    can be connected as    decoder as shown in fig     the truth table of this decoder is shown in fig    there are two and two inputs in the ic each pair must be connected together as shown in the diagram the enable input is active when in the low level state the outputs are all active low the inputs are assigned binary weights    and  equivalent to     and   respectively the outputs are assigned numbers from  to  the sum of the weights of the inputs determines the output that is active thus if the two input lines with weights  and  are activated the total weight is      and output  is activated of course the en input must be activated for any output to be active the decoder is special case of more general component referred to as coder coder is device that receives an input binary code on number of inputs and produces different binary code on number of outputs instead of using the qualifying symbol y the coder can be specified by the code name for example the  to  line decoder of fig    can be symbolized with the name bin oct since the circuit converts  bit binary number into  octal values  through  y   a      b               g en       figure   ic type    connected as    decoder before showing the graphic symbol for the multiplexer it is necessary to show variation of the and dependency the and dependency is sometimes represented by  shorthand notation like   this symbol stands for eight and dependency symbols from  to  as follows        at any given time only one out of the eight and gates can be active the active and gate is determined from the inputs associated with the symbol these inputs are marked with weights equal to the powers of  for the eight and gates just listed the weights are    and  corresponding to the numbers     and   respectively the and gate that is active at any given time is determined from the sum of the weights of the active inputs thus if inputs  and  are active then the and gate that is active has the number       this makes active and the other seven and gates inactive the standard graphic symbol for    multiplexer is shown in fig     the qualifying symbol mux identifies the device as multiplexer the symbols inside the block are part of the standard notation but the symbols marked outside are user defined symbols the function table of the    ic can be found in fig    the and  dependency is marked with  and is associated with the inputs enclosed in brackets these inputs have weights of    and  they are actually what we have called the selection inputs the eight data inputs are marked with numbers from  to  the net weight of the active inputs associated with the symbol specifies the number in the data input that is active for example if selection inputs cba    then inputs  and  associated with are active this gives numerical value for the and dependency of       which makes  active since  is anded with data input number  it makes this input active thus the output will be equal to data input provided that the enable input is active section   symbols for flip flops   strobe  en  mux select  s en     mux      b          b       b   d     y        d          ic type      mux ic type    quadruple   mux figure   graphic symbols for multiplexers figure   represents the quadruple    multiplexer ic type    whose function table is listed in fig    the enable and selection inputs are common to all four multiplexers this is indicated in the standard notation by the indented box at the top of the diagram which represents common control block the inputs to common control block control all lower sections of the diagram the common enable input en is active when in the low level state the and dependency  determines which input is active in each multiplexer section when    the inputs marked with  are active when    the inputs marked with  are active the active inputs are applied to the corresponding outputs if en is active note that the input symbols  and  are marked in the upper section only instead of repeating them in each section    symbols for flip flops the standard graphic symbols for different types of flip flops are shown in fig    flip flop is represented by rectangular shaped block with inputs on the left and outputs on the right one output designates the normal state of the flip flop and the d c latch positive edge triggered flip flop j c  k negative edge triggered positive edge triggered jk flip flop jk flip flop d c  master slave flip flop master slave jk flip flop figure   standard graphic symbols for flip flops other output with small circle negation symbol or polarity indicator designates the complement output the graphic symbols distinguish between three types of flip flops the latch whose internal construction is shown in fig    the mastercslave flip flop shown in fig    and the edge triggered flip flop introduced in fig    the graphic symbol for the latch or flip flop has inputs and indicated inside the block the graphic symbol for the jk flip flop has inputs k and inside the notation   and are examples of control dependency the input in controls input in d flip flop and inputs and in jk flip flop the latch has no other symbols besides the and inputs the edge triggered flip flop has an arrowhead shaped symbol in front of the control dependency to designate dynamic input the dynamic indicator symbol denotes that the flip flop responds to the positive edge transition of the input clock pulses small circle outside the block along the dynamic indicator designates negative edge transition for triggering the flip flop the mastercslave is considered to be pulse triggered flip flop and is section   symbols for registers     s      c         r one half   jk flip flop one half   flip flop figure   ic flip flops with direct set and reset indicated as such with an upside down symbol in front of the outputs this is to show that the output signal changes on the falling edge of the pulse note that the masterc slave flip flop is drawn without the dynamic indicator flip flops available in integrated circuit packages provide special inputs for setting and resetting the flip flop asynchronously these inputs are usually called direct set and direct reset they affect the output on the negative level of the signal without the need of clock the graphic symbol of mastercslave jk flip flop with direct set and reset is shown in fig     the notations  and represent control dependency showing that the clock input at controls inputs and s and have no  in front of the letters and therefore they are not controlled by the clock at  the and inputs have small circle along the input lines to indicate that they are active when in the logic  level the function table for the   flip flop is shown in fig    the graphic symbol for positive edge triggered flip flop with direct set and reset is shown in fig     the positive edge transition of the clock at input controls input the and inputs are independent of the clock this is ic type    whose function table is listed in fig       symbols for registers the standard graphic symbol for register is equivalent to the symbol used for group of flip flops with common clock input fig    shows the standard graphic symbol of ic type    consisting of four flip flops with common clock and clear inputs the clock input and the clear input appear in the common control block the inputs to the common control block are connected to each of the elements in the lower sections of the diagram the notation is the control dependency that controls all the inputs thus each flip flop is triggered by the common clock input the dynamic input symbol associated with indicates that the flip flops are triggered on the positive edge of the input clock the common input resets all flip flops when its input is at low level state the symbol is placed only once in the upper section instead of clear  clock          figure     graphic symbol for ic type    quad flip flop       repeating it in each section the complement outputs of the flip flops in this diagram are marked with the polarity symbol rather than the negation symbol the standard graphic symbol for shift register with parallel load is shown in fig     this is ic type    whose function table can be found in fig    the qualifying symbol for shift register is srg followed by number that designates the number of stages thus srg denotes four bit shift register the common control block has two mode dependencies and  for the shift and load operations respectively note that the ic has single input labeled sh ld shift load  which is split into two lines to show the two modes is active when the sh ld input is high and is active when the sh ld input is low is recognized as active low from the polarity indicator along its input line note the convention in this symbology we must recognize that single input actually exists in pin  but it is split into two parts in order to assign to it the two modes and  the control dependency is for the clock input the dynamic symbol along the input indicates that the flip flops trigger on the positive edge of the clock the symbol  following indicates that the register shifts to the right or in the downward direction when mode is active the four sections below the common control block represent the four flip flops flip flop qa has three inputs two are associated with the serial shift

each input is denoted by the label   the  is for  load  and  is for the clock  if the input in pin number  is in the low level is active and positive transition of the clock at causes parallel transfer from the four inputs through into the four flip flops qa through qd note that the parallel input is labeled only in the first and second sections it is assumed to be in the other two sections below figure    shows the graphic symbol for the bidirectional shift register with parallel load ic type    the function table for this ic is listed in fig    the common control block shows an input for resetting all flip flops to  asynchronously the mode select has two inputs and the mode dependency may take binary values from  to  this is indicated by the symbol   which stands for     and is similar to the notation for the dependency in multiplexers the symbol associated with the clock is   c is the control dependency for the clock the  symbol indicates that the register shifts right down in this case when the mode is  s     the  symbol  srg clear s           clock serial input     qa     qb serial input     qc   qd         figure    graphic symbol for bidirectional shift register with parallel load ic type    indicates that the register shifts left up in this case when the mode is  s     the right and left directions are obtained when the page is turned  degrees counterclockwise the sections below the common control block represent the four flip flops the first flip flop has serial input for shift right denoted by   mode  clock  input  the last flip flop has serial input for shift left denoted by   mode  clock  input  all four flip flops have parallel input denoted by the label   mode  clock  input  thus  s    is for parallel load the remaining mode  s    has no effect on the outputs because it is not included in the input labels    symbols for counters the standard graphic symbol of binary ripple counter is shown in fig     the qualifying symbol for ripple counter is rctr the designation div stands for the divide by  circuit that is obtained from the single flip flop qa the div designation is for the divide by  counter obtained from the other three flip flops the diagram represents ic type    whose internal circuit diagram is shown in fig    the common control block has an internal and gate with inputs and  when both of these inputs are equal to  the content of the counter goes to zero this is indicated by  section   symbols for counters   rctr   ct    div   qa  div   qb ct  qc   qd figure    graphic symbol for ripple counter ic type   the symbol ct   since the count input does not go to the clock inputs of all flip flops it has no label and instead the symbol  is used to indicate count up operation the dynamic symbol next to the  together with the polarity symbol along the input line signify that the count is affected with negative edge transition of the input signal the bit grouping from  to  in the output represents values for the weights to the power of  thus  represents the value of    and  represents the value     the standard graphic symbol for the four bit counter with parallel load ic type    is shown in fig     the qualifying symbol for synchronous counter is ctr followed by the symbol div  divide by   which gives the cycle length of the counter there is single load input at pin  that is split into the two modes and  is

by doping thin slice of pure silicon crystal with small amount of dopant that fits relatively easily into the crystalline structure of the silicon dopants are differentiated on the basis of whether they have either three valence electrons or five valence electrons silicon crystalline structure is such that each silicon atom shares its four valence electrons with its four nearest neighbors thereby completing its valence structure the atoms of dopant with five valence electrons referred to as n type dopant fit in the physical structure of the crystal but their fifth electrons are held only loosely by their parent atoms in the bonded structure consequently an applied electric field can cause such electrons to flow as current on the other hand dopant atom with only three valence electrons p type dopant has vacant valence site under the influence of an applied electric field an electron from neighboring silicon atom in the bonded structure can jump from its host and fill vacant dopant site leaving behind vacancy at its host this migration visualized as leapfrogging of electrons from hole to hole establishes current current is due to the movement of electrons which are negative charge carriers current is measured however in the opposite direction of flow by conventionsince the days of benjamin franklin  think of current as being the motion of an equivalent positive charge moving in the opposite direction of an electron whose charge is negative  holes move in the direction of current although the underlying physical movement of electrons is in the opposite direction thermal agitation causes both types of charge carriers to be present in semiconductor if the majority carrier is hole the device is said to be p type device if the majority carrier is an electron the device is said to be an type device bipolar transistors rely on both types of carriers metal oxide silicon semiconductors rely on majority carrier either an electron or hole but not both

type substrate n channel p channel figure  basic structure of mos transistor the basic structure of metal oxide semiconductor mos transistor is shown in fig  the channel mos transistor consists of lightly doped substrate of type silicon material two regions are heavily doped with type impurities by diffusion process to form the source and drain the source terminal supplies charge carriers to an external circuit the drain terminal removes charge carriers from the circuit the region between the two type sections serves as the channel in its simplest form the gate is metal plate separated from the channel by an insulted dielectric of silicon dioxide negative voltage with respect to the substrate at the gate terminal causes an induced electric field in the channel that attracts type carriers holes from the substrate as the magnitude of the negative voltage increases the region below the gate accumulates more positive carriers the conductivity increases and current can flow from source to drain provided that voltage difference is maintained between these two terminals there are four basic types of mos structures the channel can be or type depending on whether the majority carriers are holes or electrons the mode of operation can be enhancement or depletion depending on the state of the channel region at zero gate voltage if the channel is initially doped lightly with type impurity in which case it is called diffused channel  conducting channel exists at zero gate voltage and the device is said to operate in the depletion mode in this mode current flows unless the channel is depleted by an applied gate field if the region beneath the gate is left initially uncharged channel must be induced by the gate field before current can flow thus the channel current is enhanced by the gate voltage and such device is said to operate in the enhancement mode the source is the terminal through which the majority carriers enter the device if the majority carrier is hole type channel  the source terminal supplies current to the circuit if the majority carrier is an electron type channel  the source removes current from the circuit the drain is the terminal through which the majority carriers leave the device in p channel mos the source terminal is connected to the substrate and negative voltage is applied to the drain terminal when the gate voltage is above threshold

from source to drain type carriers are negative and correspond to positive current flow from drain to source the threshold voltage may vary from  to  depending on the particular process used the graphic symbols for the mos transistors are shown in fig  the symbol for the enhancement type is the one with the broken line connection between source and drain in this symbol the substrate can be identified and is shown connected to the source an alternative symbol omits the substrate and instead an arrow is placed in the source terminal to show the direction of positive current flow from source to drain in the channel mos and from drain to source in the channel mos  because of the symmetrical construction of source and drain the mos transistor can be operated as bilateral device although normally operated so that carriers flow from source to drain there are circumstances when it is convenient to allow carriers to flow from drain to source one advantage of the mos device is that it can be used not only as transistor but as resistor as well resistor is obtained from the mos by permanently biasing the gate terminal for conduction the ratio of the sourcecdrain voltage to the channel current then determines the value of the resistance different resistor values may be constructed during manufacturing by fixing the channel length and width of the mos device three logic circuits using mos devices are shown in fig  for an channel mos the supply voltage vdd is positive about   to allow positive current flow from drain to source the two voltage levels are function of the threshold voltage vt the low level is anywhere from zero to vt and the high level ranges from vt to vdd the channel gates usually employ positive logic the channel mos circuits use negative voltage for vdd to allow positive current flow from source to drain the two voltage levels are both negative above and below the negative threshold voltage vt channel gates usually employ negative

devices must be such that the resistance of  when conducting is much less than the resistance of to maintain the output at voltage below vt the nand gate shown in fig  uses transistors in series inputs and must both be high for all transistors to conduct and cause the output to go low if either input is low the corresponding transistor is turned off and the output is high again the series resistance formed by the two active mos devices must be much less than the resistance of the load resistor mos the nor gate shown in fig  uses transistors in parallel if either input is high the corresponding transistor conducts and the output is low if all inputs are low all active transistors are off and the output is high  complementary mos complementary mos cmos circuits take advantage of the fact that both channel and channel devices can be fabricated on the same substrate cmos circuits consist of both types of mos devices interconnected to form logic functions the basic circuit is the inverter which consists of one channel transistor and one channel transistor as shown in fig   the source terminal of the channel device is at vdd and the source terminal of the channel device is at ground the value of vdd section  complementary mos   vdd vdd y ab b nand gate vdd y n a inverter b a  nor gate figure  cmos logic circuits   appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits may be anywhere from  to   the two voltage levels are  for the low level and vdd for the high level typically   to understand the operation of the inverter we must review the behavior of the mos transistor from the previous section   the channel mos conducts when its gate to source voltage is positive   the channel mos conducts when its gate to source voltage is negative   either type of device is turned off if its gate to source voltage is zero now consider the operation of the inverter when the input is low both gates are at zero potential the input is at vdd relative to the source of the channel device and at  relative to the source of the channel device the result is that the channel device is turned on and the channel device is turned off under these conditions there is low impedance path from vdd to the output and very high impedance path from output to ground therefore the output voltage approaches the high level vdd under normal loading conditions when the input is high both gates are at vdd and the situation is reversed the channel device is off and the channel device is on the result is that the output approaches the low level of  two other cmos basic gates are shown in fig  two input nand gate consists of two type units in parallel and two type units in series as shown in fig   if all inputs are high both channel transistors turn off and both channel transistors turn on the output has low impedance to ground and produces low state if any input is low the associated channel transistor is turned off and the associated channel transistor is turned on the output is coupled to vdd and goes to the high state multiple input nand gates may be formed by placing equal numbers of type and type transistors in parallel and series respectively in an arrangement similar to that shown in fig   two input nor gate consists of two type units in parallel and two type units in series as shown in fig   when all inputs are low both channel units are on and both channel units are off the output is coupled to vdd and goes to the high state if any input is high the associated channel transistor is turned off and the associated channel transistor turns on connecting the output to ground and causing low level output mos transistors can be considered to be electronic switches that either conduct or are open as an example the cmos inverter can be visualized as consisting of two switches as shown in fig   applying low voltage to the input causes the upper switch to close supplying high voltage to the output applying high voltage to the input causes the lower switch to close connecting the output to ground thus the output vout is the complement of the input vin commercial applications often use other graphic symbols for mos transistors to emphasize the logical behavior of the switches the arrows showing the direction of current flow are omitted instead the gate input of the channel transistor is drawn with an inversion bubble on the gate terminal to show that it is enabled with low voltage the inverter circuit is redrawn with these symbols in fig   logic  in the input causes the upper transistor to conduct making the output logic  logic  in the input enables the lower transistor making the output logic  vdd  section  complementary mos   vdd vin vout y switch model logical model figure  cmos inverter cmos characteristics when cmos logic circuit is in static state its power dissipation is very low this is because at least one transistor is always off in the path between the power supply and ground when the state of the circuit is not changing as result typical cmos gate has static power dissipation on the order of   mw however when the circuit is changing state at the rate of  mhz the power dissipation increases to about  mw and at  mhz it is about  mw cmos logic is usually specified for single power supply operation over voltage range from  to  with typical vdd value of  operating cmos at larger power supply voltage reduces the propagation delay time and improves the noise margin but the power dissipation is increased the propagation delay time with vdd   ranges from  to  ns depending on the type of cmos used the noise margin is usually about   of the power supply voltage the fan out of cmos gates is about  when they are operated at frequency of  mhz the fan out decreases with an increase in the frequency of operation of the gates there are several series of the cmos digital logic family the  series are pin and function compatible with ttl devices having the same number for example cmos ic type   has six inverters with the same pin configuration as ttl type    the high speed cmos  hc series is an improvement over the  series with tenfold increase in switching speed the  hct series is electrically compatible with ttl ics this means that circuits in this series can be connected to inputs and outputs of ttl ics without the need of additional interfacing circuits newer versions of cmos are the high speed series  vhc and its ttl compatible version  vhct the cmos fabrication process is simpler than that of ttl and provides greater packing density thus more circuits can be placed on given area of silicon at reduced cost per function this property together with the low power dissipation of cmos circuits good noise immunity and reasonable propagation delay makes cmos the most popular standard as digital logic family   appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits  cmos transmission gate circuits special cmos circuit that is not available in the other digital logic families is the transmission gate the transmission gate is essentially an electronic switch that is controlled by an input logic level it is used to simplify the construction of various digital components when fabricated with cmos technology figure  shows the basic circuit of the transmission gate whereas cmos inverter consists of p channel transistor connected in series with an channel transistor transmission gate is formed by one channel and one channel mos transistor connected in parallel the channel substrate is connected to ground and the channel substrate is connected to vdd when the gate is at vdd and the gate is at ground both transistors conduct and there is closed path between input and output when the gate is at ground and the gate is at vdd both transistors are off and there is an open circuit between and figure  shows the block diagram of the transmission gate note that the terminal of the channel gate is marked with the negation symbol figure  demonstrates the behavior of the switch in terms of positive logic assignment with vdd equivalent to logic  and ground equivalent to logic  the transmission gate is usually connected to an inverter as shown in fig  this type of arrangement is referred to as bilateral switch the control input is connected directly to the channel gate and its inverse to the channel gate when   the n y tg vdd p  closed switch open

exclusive or gate can be constructed with two transmission gates and two inverters as shown in fig  input controls the paths in the transmission gates and input is connected to output through the gates when input is equal to  transmission gate tg is closed and output is equal to input when input is equal to  tg is closed and output is equal to the complement of input this results in the exclusive or truth table as indicated in fig  another circuit that can be constructed with transmission gates is the multiplexer four to one line multiplexer implemented with transmission gates is

figure  gated latch with transmission gates the level sensitive flip flop commonly referred to as the gated latch can be constructed with transmission gates as shown in fig   the input controls two transmission gates tg when   the tg connected to input has closed path and the one connected to output has an open path this configuration produces an equivalent circuit from input through two inverters to output thus the output follows the data input as long as remains active when switches to  the first tg disconnects input from the circuit and the second tg produces closed path between the two inverters at the output thus the value that was present at input at the time that went from  to  is retained at the output mastercslave flip flop can be constructed with two circuits of the type shown in fig   the first circuit is the master and the second is the slave thus mastercslave flip flop can be constructed with four transmission gates and six inverters  switch level modeling
