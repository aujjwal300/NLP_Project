Digital systems are used in communication, business transactions, traffic control, spacecraft guidance, medical treatment, weather monitoring, the Internet, and many other commercial, industrial, and scientific enterprises. We have digital telephones, digital televisions, digital versatile discs, digital cameras, handheld devices, and, of course, digital computers. We enjoy music downloaded to our portable media player (e.g., iPod Touch) and other handheld devices having high resolution displays. These devices have graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which enable them to execute commands that appear to the user to be simple, but which, in fact, involve precise execution of a sequence of complex internal instructions. Most, if not all, of these devices have a special purpose digital computer embedded within them. The most striking property of the digital computer is its generality. It can follow a sequence of instructions, called a program, that operates on given data. The user can specify and change the program or the data according to the specific need. Because of this flexibility, general purpose digital computers can perform a variety of information processing tasks that range over a wide spectrum of applications. One characteristic of digital systems is their ability to represent and manipulate discrete elements of information. Any set that is restricted to a finite number of elements contains discrete information. Examples of discrete sets are the decimal digits, the letters of the alphabet, the playing cards, and the squares of a chessboard. Early digital computers were used for numeric computations. In this case, the discrete elements were the digits. From this application, the term digital computer emerged. Discrete elements of information are represented in a digital system by phys'"

examples of discrete sets are the decimal digits the letters of the alphabet the playing cards and the squares of chessboard early digital computers were used for numeric computations in this case the discrete elements were the digits from this application the term digital computer emerged discrete elements of information are represented in digital system by physical quantities called signals electrical signals such as voltages and currents are the most common electronic devices called transistors predominate in the circuitry that implements these signals the signals in most present day electronic digital systems use just two discrete values and are therefore said to be binary binary digit called bit has two values and discrete elements of information are represented with groups of bits called binary codes for example the decimal digits through are represented in digital system with code of four bits g the number is represented by how pattern of bits is interpreted as number depends on the code system in which it resides to make this distinction we could write to indicate that the pattern is to be interpreted in binary system and to indicate that the reference system is decimal then which is not the same as or one hundred eleven the subscript indicating the base for interpreting pattern of bits will be used only when clarification is needed through various techniques groups of bits can be made to represent discrete symbols not necessarily numbers which are then used to develop the system in digital format thus digital system is system that manipulates discrete elements of information represented internally in binary form in todays technology binary systems are most practical because as we will see they can be implemented with electronic components discrete quantities of information either emerge from the nature of the data being processed or may be quantized from continuous process on the one hand payroll schedule is an inherently discrete process that contains employee names social security numbers weekly salaries income taxes and so on an employees paycheck is processed by means of discrete data values such as letters of the alphabet names digits salary and special symbols such as on the other hand research scientist may observe continuous process but record only specific quantities in tabular form the scientist is thus quantizing continuous data making each number in his or her table discrete quantity in many cases the quantization of process can be performed automatically by an analog to digital converter device that forms digital discrete representation of analog continuous quantity the general purpose digital computer is the best known example of digital system the major parts of computer are memory unit central processing unit and inputc output units the memory unit stores programs as well as input output and intermediate data the central processing unit performs arithmetic and other data processing operations as specified by the program the program and data prepared by user are transferred into memory by means of an input device such as keyboard an output device such as printer receives the results of the computations and the printed results are presented to the user digital computer can accommodate many input and output devices one very useful device is communication unit that provides interaction with other users through the internet digital computer is powerful instrument that can perform not only arithmetic computations but also logical operations in addition it can be programmed to make decisions based on internal and external conditions there are fundamental reasons that commercial products are made with digital circuits like digital computer most digital devices are programmable by changing the program in programmable device the same underlying hardware can be used for many different applications thereby allowing its cost of development to be spread across wider customer base dramatic cost reductions in digital devices have come about section binary numbers because of advances in digital integrated circuit technology as the number of transistors that can be put on piece of silicon increases to produce complex functions the cost per unit decreases and digital devices can be bought at an increasingly reduced price equipment built with digital integrated circuits can perform at speed of hundreds of millions of operations per second digital systems can be made to operate with extreme reliability by using error correcting codes an example of this strategy is the digital versatile disk dvd in which digital information representing video audio and other data is recorded without the loss of single item digital information on dvd is recorded in such way that by examining the code in each digital sample before it is played back any error can be automatically identified and corrected digital system is an interconnection of digital modules to understand the operation of each digital module it is necessary to have basic knowledge of digital circuits and their logical function the first seven chapters of this book present the basic tools of digital design such as logic gate structures combinational and sequential circuits and programmable logic devices chapter introduces digital design at the register transfer level rtl using modern hardware description language hdl chapter concludes the text with laboratory exercises using digital circuits major trend in digital design methodology is the use of hdl to describe and simulate the functionality of digital circuit an hdl resembles programming language and is suitable for describing digital circuits in textual form it is used to simulate digital system to verify its operation before hardware is built it is also used in conjunction with logic synthesis tools to automate the design process because it is important that students become familiar with an hdl based design methodology hdl descriptions of digital circuits are presented throughout the book while these examples help illustrate the features of an hdl they also demonstrate the best practices used by industry to exploit hdls ignorance of these practices will lead to cute but worthless hdl models that may simulate phenomenon but that cannot be synthesized by design tools or to models that waste silicon area or synthesize to hardware that cannot operate correctly as previously stated digital systems manipulate discrete quantities of information that are represented in binary form operands used for calculations may be expressed in the binary number system other discrete elements including the decimal digits and characters of the alphabet are represented in binary codes digital circuits also referred to as logic circuits process data by means of binary logic elements logic gates using binary signals quantities are stored in binary two valued storage elements flip flops the purpose of this chapter is to introduce the various binary concepts as frame of reference for further study in the succeeding chapters binary numbers decimal number such as represents quantity equal to thousands plus hundreds plus tens plus units the thousands hundreds etc are powers of implied by the position of the coefficients symbols in the number to be more exact is shorthand notation for what should be written as however the convention is to write only the numeric coefficients and from their position deduce the necessary powers of with powers increasing from right to left in general number with decimal point is represented by series of coefficients the coefficients aj are any of the digits and the subscript value gives the place value and hence the power of by which the coefficient must be multiplied thus the preceding decimal number can be expressed as with and the decimal number system is said to be of base or radix because it uses digits and the coefficients are multiplied by powers of the binary system is different number system the coefficients of the binary number system have only two possible values and each coefficient aj is multiplied by power of the radix g and the results are added to obtain the decimal equivalent of the number the radix point g the decimal point when is the radix distinguishes positive powers of from negative powers of for example the decimal equivalent of the binary number is as shown from the multiplication of the coefficients by powers of there are many different number systems in general number expressed in base system has coefficients multiplied by powers of an n m m the coefficients aj range in value from to to distinguish between numbers of different bases we enclose the coefficients in parentheses and write subscript equal to the base used except sometimes for decimal numbers where the content makes it obvious that the base is decimal an example of base number is the coefficient values for base can be only and the octal number system is base system that has eight digits an example of an octal number is to determine its equivalent decimal value we expand the number in power series with base of note that the digits and cannot appear in an octal number it is customary to borrow the needed digits for the coefficients from the decimal system when the base of the number is less than the letters of the alphabet are used to supplement the decimal digits when the base of the number is greater than for example in the hexadecimal base number system the first digits are borrowed section binary numbers from the decimal system the letters and are used for the digits and respectively an example of hexadecimal number is the hexadecimal system is used commonly by designers to represent long strings of bits in the addresses instructions and data in digital systems for example is used to represent as noted before the digits in binary number are called bits when bit is equal to it does not contribute to the sum during the conversion therefore the conversion from binary to decimal can be obtained by adding only the numbers with powers of two corresponding to the bits that are equal to for example there are four in the binary number the corresponding decimal number is the sum of the four powers of two zero and the first numbers obtained from to the power of are listed in table in computer work is referred to as kilo as mega as giga and as tera thus and computer capacity is usually given in bytes byte is equal to eight bits and can accommodate e represent the code of one keyboard character computer hard disk with four gigabytes of storage has capacity of bytes approximately billion bytes terabyte is gigabytes approximately trillion bytes arithmetic operations with numbers in base follow the same rules as for decimal numbers when base other than the familiar base is used one must be careful to use only the allowable digits examples of addition subtraction and multiplication of two binary numbers are as follows augend minuend multiplicand addend subtrahend multiplier sum difference partial product product table powers of two n the sum of two binary numbers is calculated by the same rules as in decimal except that the digits of the sum in any significant position can be only or any carry obtained in given significant position is used by the pair of digits one significant position higher subtraction is slightly more complicated the rules are still the same as in decimal except that the borrow in given significant position adds to minuend digit borrow in the decimal system adds to minuend digit multiplication is simple the multiplier digits are always or therefore the partial products are equal either to shifted left copy of the multiplicand or to number base conversions representations of number in different radix are said to be equivalent if they have the same decimal representation for example and are equivalentboth have decimal value the conversion of number in base to decimal is done by expanding the number in power series and adding all the terms as shown previously we now present general procedure for the reverse operation of converting decimal number to number in base if the number includes radix point it is necessary to separate the number into an integer part and fraction part since each part must be converted differently the conversion of decimal integer to number in base is done by dividing the number and all successive quotients by and accumulating the remainders this procedure is best illustrated by example example convert decimal to binary first is divided by to give an integer quotient of and remainder of then the quotient is again divided by to give new quotient and remainder the process is continued until the integer quotient becomes the coefficients of the desired binary number are obtained from the remainders as follows integer remainder coefficient quotient therefore the answer is section number base conversions the arithmetic process can be manipulated more conveniently as follows integer remainder answer conversion from decimal integers to any base system is similar to this example except that division is done by instead of example convert decimal to octal the required base is first is divided by to give an integer quotient of and remainder of then is divided by to give an integer quotient of and remainder of finally is divided by to give quotient of and remainder of this process can be conveniently manipulated as follows the conversion of decimal fraction to binary is accomplished by method similar to that used for integers however multiplication is used instead of division and integers instead of remainders are accumulated again the method is best explained by example example convert to binary first is multiplied by to give an integer and fraction then the new fraction is multiplied by to give new integer and new fraction the process is continued until the fraction becomes or until the number of digits has sufficient accuracy the coefficients of the binary number are obtained from the integers as follows integer fraction coefficient therefore the answer is to convert decimal fraction to number expressed in base similar procedure is used however multiplication is by instead of and the coefficients found from the integers may range in value from to instead of and example convert to octal the answer to seven significant figures is obtained from the integer part of the products the conversion of decimal numbers with both integer and fraction parts is done by converting the integer and the fraction separately and then combining the two answers using the results of examples and we obtain from examples and we have octal and hexadecimal numbers the conversion from and to binary octal and hexadecimal plays an important role in digital computers because shorter patterns of hex characters are easier to recognize than long patterns of and since and each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits and each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary digits the first numbers in the decimal binary octal and hexadecimal number systems are listed in table the conversion from binary to octal is easily accomplished by partitioning the binary number into groups of three digits each starting from the binary point and proceeding to the left and to the right the corresponding octal digit is then assigned to each group the following example illustrates the procedure section octal and hexadecimal numbers table numbers with different bases decimal binary octal hexadecimal base base base base b d f conversion from binary to hexadecimal is similar except that the binary number is divided into groups of four digits f the corresponding hexadecimal or octal digit for each group of binary digits is easily remembered from the values listed in table conversion from octal or hexadecimal to binary is done by reversing the preceding procedure each octal digit is converted to its three digit binary equivalent similarly each hexadecimal digit is converted to its four digit binary equivalent the procedure is illustrated in the following examples and binary numbers are difficult to work with because they require three or four times as many digits as their decimal equivalents for example the binary number is equivalent to decimal however digital computers use binary numbers and it is sometimes necessary for the human operator or user to communicate directly with the machine by means of such numbers one scheme that retains the binary system in the computer but reduces the number of digits the human must consider utilizes the relationship between the binary number system and the octal or hexadecimal system by this method the human thinks in terms of octal or hexadecimal numbers and performs the required conversion by inspection when direct communication with the machine is necessary thus the binary number has digits and is expressed in octal as digits or in hexadecimal as fff digits during communication between people about binary numbers in the computer the octal or hexadecimal representation is more desirable because it can be expressed more compactly with third or quarter of the number of digits required for the equivalent binary number thus most computer manuals use either octal or hexadecimal numbers to specify binary quantities the choice between them is arbitrary although hexadecimal tends to win out since it can represent byte with two digits complements of numbers complements are used in digital computers to simplify the subtraction operation and for logical manipulation simplifying operations leads to simpler less expensive circuits to implement the operations there are two types of complements for each base system the radix complement and the diminished radix complement the first is referred to as the rs complement and the second as the complement when the value of the base is substituted in the name the two types are referred to as the complement and complement for binary numbers and the complement and complement for decimal numbers diminished radix complement given number in base having digits the complement of e its diminished radix complement is defined as n for decimal numbers and so the complement of is n in this case represents number that consists of single followed by is number represented by for example if we have and it follows that the complement of decimal number is obtained by subtracting each digit from here are some numerical examples the complement of is the complement of is for binary numbers and so the complement of is again is represented by binary number that consists of followed by is binary number represented by for example if we have and thus the complement of binary number is obtained by subtracting each digit from however when subtracting binary digits from we can section complements of numbers have either or which causes the bit to change from to or from to respectively therefore the complement of binary number is formed by changing to and to the following are some numerical examples the complement of is the complement of is the complement of octal or hexadecimal numbers is obtained by subtracting each digit from or decimal respectively radix complement the rs complement of an digit number in base is defined as n for and as for comparing with the complement we note that the rs complement is obtained by adding to the complement since n n thus the complement of decimal is and is obtained by adding to the complement value the complement of binary is and is obtained by adding to the complement value since is number represented by followed by n which is the complement of can be formed also by leaving all least significant unchanged subtracting the first nonzero least significant digit from and subtracting all higher significant digits from thus the complement of is and the complement of is the complement of the first number is obtained by subtracting from in the least significant position and subtracting all other digits from the complement of the second number is obtained by leaving the two least significant unchanged subtracting from and subtracting the other three digits from similarly the complement can be formed by leaving all least significant and the first unchanged and replacing with and with in all other higher significant digits for example the complement of is and the complement of is the complement of the first number is obtained by leaving the two least significant and the first unchanged and then replacing with and with in the other four most significant digits the complement of the second number is obtained by leaving the least significant unchanged and complementing all other digits in the previous definitions it was assumed that the numbers did not have radix point if the original number contains radix point the point should be removed temporarily in order to form the rs or complement the radix point is then restored to the complemented number in the same relative position it is also worth mentioning that the complement of the complement restores the number to its original value to see this relationship note that the rs complement of is n so that the complement of the complement is n n and is equal to the original number subtraction with complements the direct method of subtraction taught in elementary schools uses the borrow concept in this method we borrow from higher significant position when the minuend digit is smaller than the subtrahend digit the method works well when people perform subtraction with paper and pencil however when subtraction is implemented with digital hardware the method is less efficient than the method that uses complements the subtraction of two digit unsigned numbers n in base can be done as follows add the minuend to the rs complement of the subtrahend mathematically n n n if n the sum will produce an end carry n which can be discarded what is left is the result n if n the sum does not produce an end carry and is equal to n m which is the rs complement of m to obtain the answer in familiar form take the rs complement of the sum and place negative sign in front the following examples illustrate the procedure example using complement subtract complement of sum discard end carry answer note that has five digits and has only four digits both numbers must have the same number of digits so we write as taking the complement of produces in the most significant position the occurrence of the end carry signifies that n and that the result is therefore positive section complements of numbers example using complement subtract complement of sum there is no end carry therefore the answer is complement of note that since the result is negative because we are dealing with unsigned numbers there is really no way to get an unsigned result for this case when subtracting with complements we recognize the negative answer from the absence of the end carry and the complemented result when working with paper and pencil we can change the answer to signed negative number in order to put it in familiar form subtraction with complements is done with binary numbers in similar manner using the procedure outlined previously example given the two binary numbers and perform the subtraction y and x by using complements complement of sum discard end carry answer y complement of sum there is no end carry therefore the answer is x complement of subtraction of unsigned numbers can also be done by means of the complement remember that the complement is one less than the rs complement because of this the result of adding the minuend to the complement of the subtrahend produces sum that is one less than the correct difference when an end carry occurs removing the end carry and adding to the sum is referred to as an end around carry example repeat example but this time using complement y complement of sum end around carry answer y x complement of sum there is no end carry therefore the answer is x complement of note that the negative result is obtained by taking the complement of the sum since this is the type of complement used the procedure with end around carry is also applicable to subtracting unsigned decimal numbers with complement signed binary numbers positive integers including zero can be represented as unsigned numbers however to represent negative integers we need notation for negative values in ordinary arithmetic negative number is indicated by minus sign and positive number by plus sign because of hardware limitations computers must represent everything with binary digits it is customary to represent the sign with bit placed in the leftmost position of the number the convention is to make the sign bit for positive and for negative it is important to realize that both signed and unsigned binary numbers consist of string of bits when represented in computer the user determines whether the number is signed or unsigned if the binary number is signed then the leftmost bit represents the sign and the rest of the bits represent the number if the binary number is assumed to be unsigned then the leftmost bit is the most significant bit of the number for example the string of bits can be considered as unsigned binary or as signed binary because the leftmost bit is the string of bits represents the binary equivalent of when considered as an unsigned number and the binary equivalent of when considered as signed number this is because the that is in the leftmost position designates negative and the other four bits represent binary usually there is no confusion in interpreting the bits if the type of representation for the number is known in advance section signed binary numbers the representation of the signed numbers in the last example is referred to as the signed magnitude convention in this notation the number consists of magnitude and symbol or or bit or indicating the sign this is the representation of signed numbers used in ordinary arithmetic when arithmetic operations are implemented in computer it is more convenient to use different system referred to as the signed complement system for representing negative numbers in this system negative number is indicated by its complement whereas the signed magnitude system negates number by changing its sign the signed complement system negates number by taking its complement since positive numbers always start with plus in the leftmost position the complement will always start with indicating negative number the signed complement system can use either the or the complement but the complement is the most common as an example consider the number represented in binary with eight bits is represented with sign bit of in the leftmost position followed by the binary equivalent of which gives note that all eight bits must have value therefore are inserted following the sign bit up to the first although there is only one way to represent there are three different ways to represent with eight bits signed magnitude representation signed complement representation signed complement representation in signed magnitude is obtained from by changing only the sign bit in the leftmost position from to in signed is obtained by complementing all the bits of including the sign bit the signed complement representation of is obtained by taking the complement of the positive number including the sign bit table lists all possible four bit signed binary numbers in the three representations the equivalent decimal number is also shown for reference note that the positive numbers in all three representations are identical and have in the leftmost position the signed complement system has only one representation for which is always positive the other two systems have either positive or negative something not encountered in ordinary arithmetic note that all negative numbers have in the leftmost bit position that is the way we distinguish them from the positive numbers with four bits we can represent binary numbers in the signed magnitude and the complement representations there are eight positive numbers and eight negative numbers including two zeros in the complement representation there are eight positive numbers including one zero and eight negative numbers the signed magnitude system is used in ordinary arithmetic but is awkward when employed in computer arithmetic because of the separate handling of the sign and the magnitude therefore the signed complement system is normally used the complement imposes some difficulties and is seldom used for arithmetic operations it is useful as logical operation since the change of to or to is equivalent to logical complement operation as will be shown in the next chapter the discussion of signed binary arithmetic that follows deals exclusively with the signed complement table signed binary numbers decimal signed signed signed complement complement magnitude representation of negative numbers the same procedures can be applied to the signed complement system by including the end around carry as is done with unsigned numbers arithmetic addition the addition of two numbers in the signed magnitude system follows the rules of ordinary arithmetic if the signs are the same we add the two magnitudes and give the sum the common sign if the signs are different we subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger and give the difference the sign of the larger magnitude for example is done by subtracting the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude and appending the sign of to the result this is process that requires comparison of the signs and magnitudes and then performing either addition or subtraction the same procedure applies to binary numbers in signed magnitude representation in contrast the rule for adding numbers in the signed complement system does not require comparison or subtraction but only addition the procedure is very simple and can be stated as follows for binary numbers the addition of two signed binary numbers with negative numbers represented in signed complement form is obtained from the addition of the two numbers including their sign bits carry out of the sign bit position is discarded section signed binary numbers numerical examples for addition follow note that negative numbers must be initially in complement form and that if the sum obtained after the addition is negative it is in complement form for example is represented as which is the complement of in each of the four cases the operation performed is addition with the sign bit included any carry out of the sign bit position is discarded and negative results are automatically in complement form in order to obtain correct answer we must ensure that the result has sufficient number of bits to accommodate the sum if we start with two bit numbers and the sum occupies bits we say that an overflow occurs when one performs the addition with paper and pencil an overflow is not problem because we are not limited by the width of the page we just add another to positive number or another to negative number in the most significant position to extend the number to bits and then perform the addition overflow is problem in computers because the number of bits that hold number is finite and result that exceeds the finite value by cannot be accommodated the complement form of representing negative numbers is unfamiliar to those used to the signed magnitude system to determine the value of negative number in signed complement it is necessary to convert the number to positive number to place it in more familiar form for example the signed binary number is negative because the leftmost bit is its complement is which is the binary equivalent of we therefore recognize the original negative number to be equal to arithmetic subtraction subtraction of two signed binary numbers when negative numbers are in complement form is simple and can be stated as follows take the complement of the subtrahend including the sign bit and add it to the minuend including the sign bit carry out of the sign bit position is discarded this procedure is adopted because subtraction operation can be changed to an addition operation if the sign of the subtrahend is changed as is demonstrated by the following relationship but changing positive number to negative number is easily done by taking the complement of the positive number the reverse is also true because the complement of negative number in complement form produces the equivalent positive number to see this consider the subtraction in binary with eight bits this operation is written as the subtraction is changed to addition by taking the complement of the subtrahend giving in binary this is removing the end carry we obtain the correct answer it is worth noting that binary numbers in the signed complement system are added and subtracted by the same basic addition and subtraction rules as unsigned numbers therefore computers need only one common hardware circuit to handle both types of arithmetic this consideration has resulted in the signed complement system being used in virtually all arithmetic units of computer systems the user or programmer must interpret the results of such addition or subtraction differently depending on whether it is assumed that the numbers are signed or unsigned binary codes digital systems use signals that have two distinct values and circuit elements that have two stable states there is direct analogy among binary signals binary circuit elements and binary digits binary number of digits for example may be represented by binary circuit elements each having an output signal equivalent to or digital systems represent and manipulate not only binary numbers but also many other discrete elements of information any discrete element of information that is distinct among group of quantities can be represented with binary code e pattern of and the codes must be in binary because in todays technology only circuits that represent and manipulate patterns of and can be manufactured economically for use in computers however it must be realized that binary codes merely change the symbols not the meaning of the elements of information that they represent if we inspect the bits of computer at random we will find that most of the time they represent some type of coded information rather than binary numbers an bit binary code is group of bits that assumes up to distinct combinations of and with each combination representing one element of the set that is being coded set of four elements can be coded with two bits with each element assigned one of the following bit combinations set of eight elements requires three bit code and set of elements requires four bit code the bit combination of an bit code is determined from the count in binary from to each element must be assigned unique binary bit combination and no two elements can have the same value otherwise the code assignment will be ambiguous although the minimum number of bits required to code distinct quantities is there is no maximum number of bits that may be used for binary code for example the decimal digits can be coded with bits and each decimal digit can be assigned bit combination of nine and in this particular binary code the digit is assigned the bit combination section binary codes binary coded decimal code although the binary number system is the most natural system for computer because it is readily represented in todays electronic technology most people are more accustomed to the decimal system one way to resolve this difference is to convert decimal numbers to binary perform all arithmetic calculations in binary and then convert the binary results back to decimal this method requires that we store decimal numbers in the computer so that they can be converted to binary since the computer can accept only binary values we must represent the decimal digits by means of code that contains and it is also possible to perform the arithmetic operations directly on decimal numbers when they are stored in the computer in coded form binary code will have some unassigned bit combinations if the number of elements in the set is not multiple power of the decimal digits form such set binary code that distinguishes among elements must contain at least four bits but out of the possible combinations remain unassigned different binary codes can be obtained by arranging four bits into distinct combinations the code most commonly used for the decimal digits is the straight binary assignment listed in table this scheme is called binary coded decimal and is commonly referred to as bcd other decimal codes are possible and few of them are presented later in this section table gives the four bit code for one decimal digit number with decimal digits will require bits in bcd decimal is represented in bcd with bits as with each group of bits representing one decimal digit decimal number in bcd is the same as its equivalent binary number only when the number is between and bcd number greater than looks different from its equivalent binary number even though both contain and moreover the binary combinations through are not used and have no meaning in bcd consider decimal and its corresponding value in bcd and binary table binary coded decimal bcd decimal bcd symbol digit the bcd value has bits to encode the characters of the decimal value but the equivalent binary number needs only bits it is obvious that the representation of bcd number needs more bits than its equivalent binary value however there is an advantage in the use of decimal numbers because computer input and output data are generated by people who use the decimal system it is important to realize that bcd numbers are decimal numbers and not binary numbers although they use bits in their representation the only difference between decimal number and bcd is that decimals are written with the symbols and bcd numbers use the binary code the decimal value is exactly the same decimal is represented in bcd with eight bits as and decimal as the corresponding binary values are and and have only four bits bcd addition consider the addition of two decimal digits in bcd together with possible carry from previous less significant pair of digits since each digit does not exceed the sum cannot be greater than with the being previous carry suppose we add the bcd digits as if they were binary numbers then the binary sum will produce result in the range from to in binary this range will be from to but in bcd it is from to with the first e leftmost being carry and the next four bits being the bcd sum when the binary sum is equal to or less than without carry the corresponding bcd digit is correct however when the binary sum is greater than or equal to the result is an invalid bcd digit the addition of to the binary sum converts it to the correct digit and also produces carry as required this is because carry in the most significant bit position of the binary sum and decimal carry differ by consider the following three bcd additions in each case the two bcd digits are added as if they were two binary numbers if the binary sum is greater than or equal to we add to obtain the correct bcd sum and carry in the first example the sum is equal to and is the correct bcd sum in the second example the binary sum produces an invalid bcd digit the addition of produces the correct bcd sum e the number and carry in the third example the binary sum produces carry this condition occurs when the sum is greater than or equal to although the other four bits are less than the binary sum requires correction because of the carry adding we obtain the required bcd sum e the number and bcd carry section binary codes the addition of two digit unsigned bcd numbers follows the same procedure consider the addition of in bcd bcd binary sum add bcd sum the first least significant pair of bcd digits produces bcd digit sum of and carry for the next pair of digits the second pair of bcd digits plus previous carry produces digit sum of and carry for the next pair of digits the third pair of digits plus carry produces binary sum of and does not require correction decimal arithmetic the representation of signed decimal numbers in bcd is similar to the representation of signed numbers in binary we can use either the familiar signed magnitude system or the signed complement system the sign of decimal number is usually represented with four bits to conform to the four bit code of the decimal digits it is customary to designate plus with four and minus with the bcd equivalent of which is the signed magnitude system is seldom used in computers the signed complement system can be either the or the complement but the complement is the one most often used to obtain the complement of bcd number we first take the complement and then add to the least significant digit the complement is calculated from the subtraction of each digit from the procedures developed for the signed complement system in the previous section also apply to the signed complement system for decimal numbers addition is done by summing all digits including the sign digit and discarding the end carry this operation assumes that all negative numbers are in complement form consider the addition done in the signed complement system the in the leftmost position of the second number represents minus and is the complement of the two numbers are added and the end carry is discarded to obtain of course the decimal numbers inside the computer including the sign digits must be in bcd the addition is done with bcd digits as described previously the subtraction of decimal numbers either unsigned or in the signed complement system is the same as in the binary case take the complement of the subtrahend and add it to the minuend many computers have special hardware to perform arithmetic calculations directly with decimal numbers in bcd the user of the computer can specify programmed instructions to perform the arithmetic operation with decimal numbers directly without having to convert them to binary other decimal codes binary codes for decimal digits require minimum of four bits per digit many different codes can be formulated by arranging four bits into distinct combinations bcd and three other representative codes are shown in table each code uses only out of possible bit combinations that can be arranged with four bits the other six unused combinations have no meaning and should be avoided bcd and the code are examples of weighted codes in weighted code each bit position is assigned weighting factor in such way that each digit can be evaluated by adding the weights of all the in the coded combination the bcd code has weights of and which correspond to the power of two values of each bit the bit assignment for example is interpreted by the weights to represent decimal because the bit combination when weighted by the respective digits gives the decimal equivalent of note that some digits can be coded in two possible ways in the code for instance decimal can be assigned to bit combination or since both combinations add up to total weight of table four different binary codes for the decimal digits decimal bcd excess digit unused bit combinations section binary codes bcd adders add bcd values directly digit by digit without converting the numbers to binary however it is necessary to add to the result if it is greater than bcd adders require significantly more hardware and no longer have speed advantage of conventional binary adders the and the excess codes are examples of self complementing codes such codes have the property that the complement of decimal number is obtained directly by changing to and to e by complementing each bit in the pattern for example decimal is represented in the excess code as the complement of is represented as which is obtained simply by complementing each bit of the code as with the complement of binary numbers the excess code has been used in some older computers because of its self complementing property excess is an unweighted code in which each coded combination is obtained from the corresponding binary value plus note that the bcd code is not self complementing the code is an example of assigning both positive and negative weights to decimal code in this case the bit combination is interpreted as decimal and is calculated from gray code the output data of many physical systems are quantities that are continuous these data must be converted into digital form before they are applied to digital system continuous or analog information is converted into digital form by means of an analog to digital converter it is sometimes convenient to use the gray code shown in table to represent digital data that have been converted from analog data the advantage of the gray code over the straight binary number sequence is that only one bit in the code group changes in going from one number to the next for example in going from to the gray code changes from to only the first bit changes from to the other three bits remain the same by contrast with binary numbers the change from to will be from to which causes all four bits to change values the gray code is used in applications in which the normal sequence of binary numbers generated by the hardware may produce an error or ambiguity during the transition from one number to the next if binary numbers are used change for example from to may produce an intermediate erroneous number if the value of the rightmost bit takes longer to change than do the values of the other three bits this could have serious consequences for the machine using the information the gray code eliminates this problem since only one bit changes its value during any transition between two numbers typical application of the gray code is the representation of analog data by continuous change in the angular position of shaft the shaft is partitioned into segments and each segment is assigned number if adjacent segments are made to correspond with the gray code sequence ambiguity is eliminated between the angle of the shaft and the value encoded by the sensor table decimal gray code equivalent gray code ascii character code many applications of digital computers require the handling not only of numbers but also of other characters or symbols such as the letters of the alphabet for instance consider high tech company with thousands of employees to represent the names and other pertinent information it is necessary to formulate binary code for the letters of the alphabet in addition the same binary code must represent numerals and special characters such as an alphanumeric character set is set of elements that includes the decimal digits the letters of the alphabet and number of special characters such set contains between and elements if only capital letters are included or between and elements if both uppercase and lowercase letters are included in the first case we need binary code of six bits and in the second we need binary code of seven bits the standard binary code for the alphanumeric characters is the american standard code for information interchange ascii which uses seven bits to code characters as shown in table the seven bits of the code are designated by through with the most significant bit the letter for example is represented in ascii as column row the ascii code also contains graphic characters that can be printed and nonprinting characters used for various control functions the graphic characters consist of the uppercase letters through the lowercase letters through the numerals through and special printable characters such as and section binary codes table american standard code for information interchange ascii nul dle sp

listed again below the table with their functional names the control characters are used for routing data and arranging the printed text into prescribed format there are three types of control characters format effectors information separators and communication control characters format effectors are characters that control the layout of printing they include the familiar word processor and typewriter controls such as backspace bs horizontal tabulation ht and carriage return cr information separators are used to separate the data into divisions such as paragraphs and pages they include characters such as record separator rs and file separator fs the communication control characters are useful during the transmission of text between remote devices so that it can be distinguished from other messages using the same communication channel before it and after it examples of communication control characters are stx start of text and etx end of text which are used to frame text message transmitted through communication channel ascii is seven bit code but most computers manipulate an eight bit quantity as single unit called byte therefore ascii characters most often are stored one per byte the extra bit is sometimes used for other purposes depending on the application for example some printers recognize eight bit ascii characters with the most significant bit set to an additional eight bit characters with the most significant bit set to are used for other symbols such as the greek alphabet or italic type font error detecting code to detect errors in data communication and processing an eighth bit is sometimes added to the ascii character to indicate its parity parity bit is an extra bit included with message to make the total number of either even or odd consider the following two characters and their even and odd parity ascii with even parity with odd parity ascii in each case we insert an extra bit in the leftmost position of the code to produce an even number of in the character for even parity or an odd number of in the character for odd parity in general one or the other parity is adopted with even parity being more common the parity bit is helpful in detecting errors during the transmission of information from one location to another this function is handled by generating an even parity bit at the sending end for each character the eight bit characters that include parity bits are transmitted to their destination the parity of each character is then checked at the receiving end if the parity of the received character is not even then at least one bit has changed value during the transmission this method detects one three or any odd combination of errors in each character that is transmitted an even combination of errors however goes undetected and additional error detection codes may be needed to take care of that possibility what is done after an error is detected depends on the particular application one possibility is to request retransmission of the message on the assumption that the error was random and will not occur again thus if the receiver detects parity error it sends section binary storage and registers back the ascii nak negative acknowledge control character consisting of an even parity eight bits if no error is detected the receiver sends back an ack acknowledge control character namely sending end will respond to an nak by transmitting the message again until the correct parity is received if after number of attempts the transmission is still in error message can be sent to the operator to check for malfunctions in the transmission path binary storage and registers the binary information in digital computer must have physical existence in some medium for storing individual bits binary cell is device that possesses two stable states and is capable of storing one bit or of information the input to the cell receives excitation signals that set it to one of the two states the output of the cell is physical quantity that distinguishes between the two states the information stored in cell is when the cell is in one stable state and when the cell is in the other stable state registers register is group of binary cells register with cells can store any discrete quantity of information that contains bits the state of register is an tuple of and with each bit designating the state of one cell in the register the content of register is function of the interpretation given to the information stored in it consider for example bit register with the following binary content register with cells can be in one of possible states if one assumes that the content of the register represents binary integer then the register can store any binary number from to for the particular example shown the content of the register is the binary equivalent of the decimal number if one assumes instead that the register stores alphanumeric characters of an eight bit code then the content of the register is any two meaningful characters for the ascii code with an even parity placed in the eighth most significant bit position the register contains the two characters the leftmost eight bits and the rightmost eight bits if however one interprets the content of the register to be four decimal digits represented by four bit code then the content of the register is four digit decimal number in the excess code the register holds the decimal number the content of the register is meaningless in bcd because the bit combination is not assigned to any decimal digit from this example it is clear that register can store discrete elements of information and that the same bit configuration may be interpreted differently for different types of data depending on the application register transfer digital system is characterized by its registers and the components that perform data processing in digital systems register transfer operation is basic operation that consists of transfer of binary information from one set of registers into another set of registers the transfer may be direct from one register to another or may pass through data processing circuits to perform an operation figure illustrates the transfer of information among registers and demonstrates pictorially the transfer of binary information from keyboard into register in the memory unit the input unit is assumed to have keyboard control circuit and an input register each time key is struck the control circuit enters an equivalent eight bit alphanumeric character code into the input register we shall assume that the code used is the ascii code with an odd parity bit the information from the input register is transferred into the eight least significant cells of processor register after every transfer the input register is cleared to enable the control to insert new eight bit code when the keyboard is struck again each eight bit character transferred to the processor register is preceded by shift of the previous character to the next eight cells on its left when transfer of four characters is completed the processor register is full and its contents are transferred into memory register the content stored in the memory unit o n memory register processor unit cells cells cells cells processor register input unit cells input register o control keyboard n figure transfer of information among registers section binary storage and registers memory register shown in fig came from the transfer of the characters and after the four appropriate keys were struck to process discrete quantities of information in binary form computer must be provided with devices that hold the data to be processed and with circuit elements that manipulate individual bits of information the device most commonly used for holding data is register binary variables are manipulated by means of digital logic circuits figure illustrates the process of adding two bit binary numbers the memory unit which normally consists of millions of registers is shown with only three of its registers the part of the processor unit shown consists of three and together with digital logic circuits that manipulate the bits of and and transfer into binary number equal to their arithmetic sum memory registers store information and are incapable of processing the two operands however the information stored in memory can be transferred to processor registers and the results obtained in processor registers can be transferred back into memory register for storage until needed again the diagram shows the contents of two operands transferred from two memory registers memory unit sum operand operand digital logic circuits for binary addition processor unit figure example of binary information processing into and the digital logic circuits produce the sum which is transferred to register the contents of can now be transferred back to one of the memory registers the last two examples demonstrated the information flow capabilities of digital system in simple manner the registers of the system are the basic elements for storing and holding the binary information digital logic circuits process the binary information stored in the registers digital logic circuits and registers are covered in chapters through the memory unit is explained in chapter the description of register operations at the register transfer level and the design of digital systems are covered in chapter binary logic binary logic deals with variables that take on two discrete values and with operations that assume logical meaning the two values the variables assume may be called by different names true and false yes and no etc but for our purpose it is convenient to think in terms of bits and assign the values and the binary logic introduced in this section is equivalent to an algebra called boolean algebra the formal presentation of boolean algebra is covered in more detail in chapter the purpose of this section is to introduce boolean algebra in heuristic manner and relate it to digital logic circuits and binary signals definition of binary logic binary logic consists of binary variables and set of logical operations the variables are designated by letters of the alphabet such as etc with each variable having two and only two distinct possible values and there are three basic logical operations and or and not each operation produces binary result denoted by and this operation is represented by dot or by the absence of an operator for example or xy is read and is equal to the logical operation and is interpreted to mean that if and only if and otherwise remember that and are binary variables and can be equal either to or and nothing else the result of the operation is or this operation is represented by plus sign for example is read or is equal to meaning that if or if or if both and if both and then not this operation is represented by prime sometimes by an overbar for example or is read not is equal to meaning that is what is not in other words if then but if then the not operation is also referred to as the complement operation since it changes to and to e the result of complementing is and vice versa binary logic resembles binary arithmetic and the operations and and or have similarities to multiplication and addition respectively in fact the symbols used for table section binary logic truth tables of logical operations not and or x y y y y and and or are the same as those used for multiplication and addition however binary logic should not be confused with binary arithmetic one should realize that an arithmetic variable designates number that may consist of many digits logic variable is always either or for example in binary arithmetic we have read one plus one is equal to whereas in binary logic we have read one or one is equal to one for each combination of the values of and there is value of specified by the definition of the logical operation definitions of logical operations may be listed in compact form called truth tables truth table is table of all possible combinations of the variables showing the relation between the values that the variables may take and the result of the operation the truth tables for the operations and and or with variables and are obtained by listing all possible values that the variables may have when combined in pairs for each combination the result of the operation is then listed in separate row the truth tables for and or and not are given in table these tables clearly demonstrate the definition of the operations logic gates logic gates are electronic circuits that operate on one or more input signals to produce an output signal electrical signals such as voltages or currents exist as analog signals having values over given continuous range say to but in digital system these voltages are interpreted to be either of two recognizable values or voltage operated logic circuits respond to two separate voltage levels that represent binary variable equal to logic or logic for example particular digital system may define logic as signal equal to and logic as signal equal to in practice each voltage level has an acceptable range as shown in fig the input terminals of digital circuits accept binary signals within the allowable range and respond at the output terminals with binary signals that fall within the specified range the intermediate region between the allowed regions is crossed only during state transition any desired information for computing or control can be operated on by passing binary signals through various combinations of logic gates with each signal representing particular binary variable when the physical signal is in particular range it is interpreted to be either or volts signal range for logic transition occurs between these limits signal range for figure logic signal levels for binary logic values zxy z y x y two input and gate two input or gate not gate or inverter figure symbols for digital logic circuits the graphic symbols used to designate the three types of gates are shown in fig the gates are blocks of hardware that produce the equivalent of logic or logic output signals if input logic requirements are satisfied the input signals and in the and and or gates may exist in one of four possible states or these input signals are shown in fig together with the corresponding output signal for each gate the timing diagrams illustrate the idealized response of each gate to the four input signal combinations the horizontal axis of the timing diagram represents the time and the vertical axis shows the signal as it changes between the two possible voltage levels in reality the transitions between logic values occur quickly but not instantaneously the low level represents logic the high level logic the and gate responds with logic output signal when both input signals are logic the or gate responds with logic output signal if any input signal is logic the not gate is commonly referred to as an inverter the reason for this name is apparent from the signal response in the timing diagram which shows that the output signal inverts the logic sense of the input signal problems y and y or y not figure inputcoutput signals for gates f abc gabcd b c three input and gate four input or gate figure gates with multiple inputs and and or gates may have more than two inputs an and gate with three inputs and an or gate with four inputs are shown in fig the three input and gate responds with logic output if all three inputs are logic the output produces logic if any input is logic the four input or gate responds with logic if any input is logic its output becomes logic only

gates introduction because binary logic is used in all of todays digital computers and devices the cost of the circuits that implement it is an important factor addressed by designersbe they computer engineers electrical engineers or computer scientists finding simpler and cheaper but equivalent realizations of circuit can reap huge payoffs in reducing the overall cost of the design mathematical methods that simplify circuits rely primarily on boolean algebra therefore this chapter provides basic vocabulary and brief foundation in boolean algebra that will enable you to optimize simple circuits and to understand the purpose of algorithms used by software tools to optimize complex circuits involving millions of logic gates basic definitions boolean algebra like any other deductive mathematical system may be defined with set of elements set of operators and number of unproved axioms or postulates set of elements is any collection of objects usually having common property if is set and and are certain objects then the notation h means that is member of the set and x means that is not an element of set with denumerable number of elements is specified by braces indicates that the elements of set are the numbers and binary operator defined on set of elements is rule that assigns to each pair of elements from unique element from as an example consider the relation we say that is binary operator if it specifies rule for finding from the pair and also if h however is not binary operator if h and if x section basic definitions the postulates of mathematical system form the basic assumptions from which it is possible to deduce the rules theorems and properties of the system the most common postulates used to formulate various algebraic structures are as follows closure set is closed with respect to binary operator if for every pair of elements of the binary operator specifies rule for obtaining unique element of for example the set of natural numbers is closed with respect to the binary operator by the rules of arithmetic addition since for any h there is unique h such that the set of natural numbers is not closed with respect to the binary operator by the rules of arithmetic subtraction because and n but n associative law binary operator on set is said to be associative whenever for all s commutative law binary operator on set is said to be commutative whenever for all h identity element set is said to have an identity element with respect to binary operation on if there exists an element h with the property that for every h example the element is an identity element with respect to the binary operator on the set of integers since for any h the set of natural numbers has no identity element since is excluded from the set inverse set having the identity element with respect to binary operator is said to have an inverse whenever for every h there exists an element h such that example in the set of integers and the operator with the inverse of an element is since distributive law if and are two binary operators on set is said to be distributive over whenever field is an example of an algebraic structure field is set of elements together with two binary operators each having properties through and both operators combining to give property the set of real numbers together with the binary operators and forms the field of real numbers the field of real numbers is the basis for arithmetic and ordinary algebra the operators and postulates have the following meanings the binary operator defines addition the additive identity is the additive inverse defines subtraction the binary operator defines multiplication the multiplicative identity is for the multiplicative inverse of defines division e the only distributive law applicable is that of over axiomatic definition of boolean algebra in george boole developed an algebraic system now called boolean algebra in claude shannon introduced two valued boolean algebra called switching algebra that represented the properties of bistable electrical switching circuits for the formal definition of boolean algebra we shall employ the postulates formulated by huntington in boolean algebra is an algebraic structure defined by set of elements together with two binary operators and provided that the following huntington postulates are satisfied the structure is closed with respect to the operator the structure is closed with respect to the operator the element is an identity element with respect to that is the element is an identity element with respect to that is the structure is commutative with respect to that is the structure is commutative with respect to that is the operator is distributive over that is the operator is distributive over that is for every element h there exists an element h called the complement of such that and there exist at least two elements h such that y comparing boolean algebra with arithmetic and ordinary algebra the field of real numbers we note the following differences huntington postulates do not include the associative law however this law holds for boolean algebra and can be derived for both operators from the other postulates the distributive law of over e is valid for boolean algebra but not for ordinary algebra section axiomatic definition of boolean algebra boolean algebra does not have additive or multiplicative inverses therefore there are no subtraction or division operations postulate defines an operator called the complement that is not available in ordinary algebra ordinary algebra deals with the real numbers which constitute an infinite set of elements boolean algebra deals with the as yet undefined set of elements but in the two valued boolean algebra defined next and of interest in our subsequent use of that algebra is defined as set with only two elements and boolean algebra resembles ordinary algebra in some respects the choice of the symbols and is intentional to facilitate boolean algebraic manipulations by persons already familiar with ordinary algebra although one can use some knowledge from ordinary algebra to deal with boolean algebra the beginner must be careful not to substitute the rules of ordinary algebra where they are not applicable it is important to distinguish between the elements of the set of an algebraic structure and the variables of an algebraic system for example the elements of the field of real numbers are numbers whereas variables such as etc used in ordinary algebra are symbols that stand for real numbers similarly in boolean algebra one defines the elements of the set and variables such as and are merely symbols that represent the elements at this point it is important to realize that in order to have boolean algebra one must show that the elements of the set the rules of operation for the two binary operators and the set of elements together with the two operators satisfy the six huntington postulates one can formulate many boolean algebras depending on the choice of elements of and the rules of operation in our subsequent work we deal only with two valued boolean algebra e boolean algebra with only two elements two valued boolean algebra has applications in set theory the algebra of classes and in propositional logic our interest here is in the application of boolean algebra to gate type circuits commonly used in digital devices and computers two valued boolean algebra two valued boolean algebra is defined on set of two elements with rules for the two binary operators and as shown in the following operator tables the rule for the complement operator is for verification of postulate y y y xy x these rules are exactly the same as the and or and not operations respectively defined in table we must now show that the huntington postulates are valid for the set and the two binary operators and that the structure is closed with respect to the two operators is obvious from the tables since the result of each operation is either or and b from the tables we see that this establishes the two identity elements for and for as defined by postulate the commutative laws are obvious from the symmetry of the binary operator tables the distributive law can be shown to hold from the operator tables by forming truth table of all possible values of and for each combination we derive and show that the value is the same as the value of xy y x z x the distributive law of over can be shown to hold by means of truth table similar to the one in part from the complement table it is easily shown that since and since and thus postulate is verified postulate is satisfied because the two valued boolean algebra has two elements and with we have just established two valued boolean algebra having set of two elements and two binary operators with rules equivalent to the and and or operations and complement operator equivalent to the not operator thus boolean algebra has been defined in formal mathematical manner and has been shown to be equivalent to the binary logic presented heuristically in section the heuristic presentation is helpful in understanding the application of boolean algebra to gate type circuits the formal section basic theorems and properties of boolean algebra presentation is necessary for developing the theorems and properties of the algebraic system the two valued boolean algebra defined in this section is also called switching algebra by engineers to emphasize the similarities between two valued boolean algebra and other binary systems that algebra was called binary logic in section from here on we shall drop the adjective two valued from boolean algebra in subsequent discussions basic theorems and properties of boolean algebra duality in section the huntington postulates were listed in pairs and designated by part and part one part may be obtained from the other if the binary operators and the identity elements are interchanged this important property of boolean algebra is called the duality principle and states that every algebraic expression deducible from the postulates of boolean algebra remains valid if the operators and identity elements are interchanged in two valued boolean algebra the identity elements and the elements of the set are the same and the duality principle has many applications if the dual of an algebraic expression is desired we simply interchange or and and operators and replace by and by basic theorems table lists six theorems of boolean algebra and four of its postulates the notation is simplified by omitting the binary operator whenever doing so does not lead to confusion the theorems and postulates listed are the most basic relationships in boolean table postulates and theorems of boolean algebra postulate postulate theorem x theorem theorem involution postulate commutative y xy yx theorem associative yz y postulate distributive y z yz theorem demorgan y y theorem absorption xy algebra the theorems like the postulates are listed in pairs each relation is the dual of the one paired with it the postulates are basic axioms of the algebraic structure and need no proof the theorems must be proven from the postulates proofs of the theorems with one variable are presented next at the right is listed the number of the postulate which justifies that particular step of the proof theorem statement justification postulate xx theorem statement justification xx postulate xx xx x note that theorem is the dual of theorem and that each step of the proof in part is the dual of its counterpart in part any dual theorem can be similarly derived from the proof of its corresponding theorem theorem statement justification postulate theorem by duality theorem from postulate we have and which together define the complement of the complement of is and is also section basic theorems and properties of boolean algebra therefore since the complement is unique we have the theorems involving two or three variables may be proven algebraically from the postulates and the theorems that have already been proven take for example the absorption theorem theorem xy statement justification postulate xy xy y theorem x by duality the theorems of boolean algebra can be proven by means of truth tables in truth tables both sides of the relation are checked to see whether they yield identical results for all possible combinations of the variables involved the following truth table verifies the first absorption theorem y xy xy the algebraic proofs of the associative law and demorgans theorem are long and will not be shown here however their validity is easily shown with truth tables for example the truth table for the first demorgans theorem xy is as follows y y y y xy operator precedence the operator precedence for evaluating boolean expressions is parentheses not and and or in other words expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated before all other operations the next operation that holds precedence is the complement and then follows the and and finally the or as an example consider the truth table for one of demorgans theorems the left side of the expression is therefore the expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first and the result then complemented the right side of the expression is xy so the complement of and the complement of are both evaluated first and the result is then anded note that in ordinary arithmetic the same precedence holds except for the complement when multiplication and addition are replaced by and and or respectively boolean functions boolean algebra is an algebra that deals with binary variables and logic operations boolean function described by an algebraic expression consists of binary variables the constants and and the logic operation symbols for given value of the binary variables the function can be equal to either or as an example consider the boolean function yz the function is equal to if is equal to or if both and are equal to is equal to otherwise the complement operation dictates that when therefore if or if and boolean function expresses the logical relationship between binary variables and is evaluated by determining the binary value of the expression for all possible values of the variables boolean function can be represented in truth table the number of rows in the truth table is where is the number of variables in the function the binary combinations for the truth table are obtained from the binary numbers by counting from through table shows the truth table for the function there are eight possible binary combinations for assigning bits to the three variables and the column labeled contains either or for each of these combinations the table shows that the function is equal to when or when yz and is equal to otherwise boolean function can be transformed from an algebraic expression into circuit diagram composed of logic gates connected in particular structure the logic circuit diagram also called schematic for is shown in fig is an inverter for input to generate its complement there is an and gate for the term yz and an or gate table truth tables for and y section boolean functions y figure gate implementation of yz that combines with yz in logic circuit diagrams the variables of the function are taken as the inputs of the circuit and the binary variable is taken as the output of the circuit the schematic expresses the relationship between the output of the circuit and its inputs rather than listing each combination of inputs and outputs it indicates how to compute the logic value of each output from the logic values of the inputs there is only one way that boolean function can be represented in truth table however when the function is in algebraic form it can be expressed in variety of ways all of which have equivalent logic the particular expression used to represent the function will dictate the interconnection of gates in the logic circuit diagram conversely the interconnection of gates will dictate the logic expression here is key fact that motivates our use of boolean algebra by manipulating boolean expression according to the rules of boolean algebra it is sometimes possible to obtain simpler expression for the same function and thus reduce the number of gates in the circuit and the number of inputs to the gate designers are motivated to reduce the complexity and number of gates because their effort can significantly reduce the cost of circuit consider for example the following boolean function xyz xyz xy schematic of an implementation of this function with logic gates is shown in fig input variables and are complemented with inverters to obtain and the three terms in the expression are implemented with three and gates the or gate forms the logical or of the three terms the truth table for is listed in table the function is equal to when xyz or or when xy irrespective of the value of and is equal to otherwise this set of conditions produces four and four for now consider the possible simplification of the function by applying some of the identities of boolean algebra xyz xyz xy xz xy xz xy the function is reduced to only two terms and can be implemented with gates as shown in fig it is obvious that the circuit in is simpler than the one in yet both implement the same function by means of truth table it is possible to verify that the two expressions are equivalent the simplified expression is equal to when xz or when xy this produces the same four in the truth table since both expressions y xyz xyz xy y xy xz figure implementation of boolean function with gates produce the same truth table they are equivalent therefore the two circuits have the same outputs for all possible binary combinations of inputs of the three variables each circuit implements the same identical function but the one with fewer gates and fewer inputs to gates is preferable because it requires fewer wires and components in general there are many equivalent representations of logic function finding the most economic representation of the logic is an important design task algebraic manipulation when boolean expression is implemented with logic gates each term requires gate and each variable within the term designates an input to the gate we define literal to be single variable within term in complemented or uncomplemented form the function of fig has three terms and eight literals and the one in fig has two terms and four literals by reducing the number of terms the number of literals or both in boolean expression it is often possible to obtain simpler circuit the manipulation of boolean algebra consists mostly of reducing an expression for the purpose of obtaining simpler circuit functions of up to five variables can be simplified by the map method described in the next chapter for complex boolean functions and many section boolean functions different outputs designers of digital circuits use computer minimization programs that are capable of producing optimal circuits with millions of logic gates the concepts introduced in this chapter provide the framework for those tools the only manual method available is cut and try procedure employing the basic relations and other manipulation techniques that become familiar with use but remain nevertheless subject to human error the examples that follow illustrate the algebraic manipulation of boolean algebra to acquaint the reader with this important design task example simplify the following boolean functions to minimum number of literals x xx xy xy xy xy xy xy yy xy xz yz xy xz yz xy xz xyz xyz xy xz by duality from function functions and are the dual of each other and use dual expressions in corresponding steps an easier way to simplify function is by means of postulate from table yy the fourth function illustrates the fact that an increase in the number of literals sometimes leads to simpler final expression function is not minimized directly but can be derived from the dual of the steps used to derive function functions and are together known as the consensus theorem complement of function the complement of function is and is obtained from an interchange of for and for in the value of the complement of function may be derived algebraically through demorgans theorems listed in table for two variables demorgans theorems can be extended to three or more variables the three variable form of the first demorgans theorem is derived as follows from postulates and theorems listed in table let ax by theorem demorgan b substitute bc by theorem demorgan abc by theorem associative demorgans theorems for any number of variables resemble the two variable case in form and can be derived by successive substitutions similar to the method used in the preceding derivation these theorems can be generalized as follows abcd f abcd f the generalized form of demorgans theorems states that the complement of function is obtained by interchanging and and or operators and complementing each literal example find the complement of the functions xyz xyz and yz yz by applying demorgans theorems as many times as necessary the complements are obtained as follows xyz xyz xyz xyz yz yz yz yz yz yz yz yz simpler procedure for deriving the complement of function is to take the dual of the function and complement each literal this method follows from the generalized forms of demorgans theorems remember that the dual of function is obtained from the interchange of and and or operators and and example find the complement of the functions and of example by taking their duals and complementing each literal xyz xyz the dual of is complement each literal yz yz the dual of is complement each literal section canonical and standard forms canonical and standard forms minterms and maxterms binary variable may appear either in its normal form or in its complement form now consider two binary variables and combined with an and operation since each variable may appear in either form there are four possible combinations xy xy xy and xy each of these four and terms is called minterm or standard product in similar manner variables can be combined to form minterms the different minterms may be determined by method similar to the one shown in table for three variables the binary numbers from to are listed under the variables each minterm is obtained from an and term of the variables with each variable being primed if the corresponding bit of the binary number is and unprimed if a symbol for each minterm is also shown in the table and is of the form mj where the subscript denotes the decimal equivalent of the binary number of the minterm designated in similar fashion variables forming an or term with each variable being primed or unprimed provide possible combinations called maxterms or standard sums the eight maxterms for three variables together with their symbolic designations are listed in table any maxterms for variables may be determined similarly it is important to note that each maxterm is obtained from an or term of the variables with each variable being unprimed if the corresponding bit is and primed if and each maxterm is the complement of its corresponding minterm and vice versa boolean function can be expressed algebraically from given truth table by forming minterm for each combination of the variables that produces in the function and then taking the or of all those terms for example the function in table is determined by expressing the combinations and as xyz xyz and xyz respectively since each one of these minterms results in we have xyz xyz xyz table minterms and maxterms for three binary variables minterms maxterms y term designation term designation xyz y xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz table functions of three variables y function function similarly it may be easily verified that xyz xyz xyz xyz these examples demonstrate an important property of boolean algebra any boolean function can be expressed as sum of minterms with sum meaning the oring of terms now consider the complement of boolean function it may be read from the truth table by forming minterm for each combination that produces in the function and then oring those terms the complement of is read as xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz if we take the complement of we obtain the function similarly it is possible to read the expression for from the table these examples demonstrate second property of boolean algebra any boolean function can be expressed as product of maxterms with product meaning the anding of terms the procedure for obtaining the product of maxterms directly from the truth table is as follows form maxterm for each combination of the variables that produces in the function and then form the and of all those maxterms boolean functions expressed as sum of minterms or product of maxterms are said to be in canonical form sum of minterms previously we stated that for binary variables one can obtain distinct minterms and that any boolean function can be expressed as sum of minterms the minterms whose sum defines the boolean function are those which give the of the function in section canonical and standard forms truth table since the function can be either or for each minterm and since there are minterms one can calculate all the functions that can be formed with variables to be it is sometimes convenient to express boolean function in its sum of minterms form if the function is not in this form it can be made so by first expanding the expression into sum of and terms each term is then inspected to see if it contains all the variables if it misses one or more variables it is anded with an expression such as where is one of the missing variables the next example clarifies this procedure example express the boolean function bc as sum of minterms the function has three variables and the first term is missing two variables therefore b ab ab this function is still missing one variable so ab ab abc abc abc abc the second term bc is missing one variable hence bc bc abc abc combining all terms we have bc abc abc abc abc abc but abc appears twice and according to theorem it is possible to remove one of those occurrences rearranging the minterms in ascending order we finally obtain abc abc abc abc abc when boolean function is in its sum of minterms form it is sometimes convenient to express the function in the following brief notation a the summation symbol stands for the oring of terms the numbers following it are the indices of the minterms of the function the letters in parentheses following form list of the variables in the order taken when the minterm is converted to an and term an alternative procedure for deriving the minterms of boolean function is to obtain the truth table of the function directly from the algebraic expression and then read the minterms from the truth table consider the boolean function given in example bc the truth table shown in table can be derived directly from the algebraic expression by listing the eight binary combinations under variables and and inserting table truth table for a bc b f under for those combinations for which and bc from the truth table we can then read the five minterms of the function to be and product of maxterms each of the functions of binary variables can be also expressed as product of maxterms to express boolean function as product of maxterms it must first be brought into form of or terms this may be done by using the distributive law yz then any missing variable in each or term is ored with xx the procedure is clarified in the following example example express the boolean function xy xz as product of maxterms first convert the function into or terms by using the distributive law xy xz xy xy the function has three variables and each or term is missing one variable therefore zz yy xx combining all the terms and removing those which appear more than once we finally obtain section canonical and standard forms convenient way to express this function is as follows x the product symbol denotes the anding of maxterms the numbers are the indices of the maxterms of the function conversion between canonical forms the complement of function expressed as the sum of minterms equals the sum of minterms missing from the original function this is because the original function is expressed by those minterms which make the function equal to whereas its complement is for those minterms for which the function is as an example consider the function a this function has complement that can be expressed as a now if we take the complement of by demorgans theorem we obtain in different form the last conversion follows from the definition of minterms and maxterms as shown in table from the table it is clear that the following relation holds mj mj that is the maxterm with subscript is complement of the minterm with the same subscript and vice versa the last example demonstrates the conversion between function expressed in sum of minterms form and its equivalent in product of maxterms form similar argument will show that the conversion between the product of maxterms and the sum of minterms is similar we now state general conversion procedure to convert from one canonical form to another interchange the symbols and and list those numbers missing from the original form in order to find the missing terms one must realize that the total number of minterms or maxterms is where is the number of binary variables in the function boolean function can be converted from an algebraic expression to product of maxterms by means of truth table and the canonical conversion procedure consider for example the boolean expression xy xz first we derive the truth table of the function as shown in table the under in the table are determined from the combination of the variables for which xy or xz the minterms of the function are read from the truth table to be and the function expressed as sum of minterms is x table truth table for xy xz y f minterms maxterms since there is total of eight minterms or maxterms in function of three variables we determine the missing terms to be and the function expressed as product of maxterms is x the same answer as obtained in example standard forms the two canonical forms of boolean algebra are basic forms that one obtains from reading given function from the truth table these forms are very seldom the ones with the least number of literals because each minterm or maxterm must contain by definition all the variables either complemented or uncomplemented another way to express boolean functions is in standard form in this configuration the terms that form the function may contain one two or any number of literals there are two types of standard forms the sum of products and products of sums the sum of products is boolean expression containing and terms called product terms with one or more literals each the sum denotes the oring of these terms an example of function expressed as sum of products is xy xyz the expression has three product terms with one two and three literals their sum is in effect an or operation the logic diagram of sum of products expression consists of group of and gates followed by single or gate this configuration pattern is shown in fig each product term requires an and gate except for term with single literal the logic sum is formed with an or gate whose inputs are the outputs of the and gates and the single literal it is assumed that the input variables are directly available in their complements so inverters are not included in the diagram this circuit configuration is referred to as two level implementation section canonical and standard forms x y z x y z sum of products product of sums figure two level implementation a b c d c ab d ab cd ce figure three and two level implementation product of sums is boolean expression containing or terms called sum terms each term may have any number of literals the product denotes the anding of these terms an example of function expressed as product of sums is y this expression has three sum terms with one two and three literals the product is an and operation the use of the words product and sum stems from the similarity of the and operation to the arithmetic product multiplication and the similarity of the or operation to the arithmetic sum addition the gate structure of the product of sums expression consists of group of or gates for the sum terms except for single literal followed by an and gate as shown in fig this standard type of expression results in two level structure of gates boolean function may be expressed in nonstandard form for example the function ab d is neither in sum of products nor in product of sums form the implementation of this expression is shown in fig and requires two and gates and two or gates there are three levels of gating in this circuit it can be changed to standard form by using the distributive law to remove the parentheses ab d ab cd ce the sum of products expression is implemented in fig in general two level implementation is preferred because it produces the least amount of delay through the gates when the signal propagates from the inputs to the output however the number of inputs to given gate might not be practical other logic operations when the binary operators and and or are placed between two variables and they form two boolean functions and respectively previously we stated that there are functions for binary variables thus for two variables and the number of possible boolean functions is therefore the and and or functions are only of total of possible functions formed with two binary variables it would be instructive to find the other functions and investigate their properties the truth tables for the functions formed with two binary variables are listed in table each of the columns to represents truth table of one possible function for the two variables and note that the functions are determined from the binary combinations that can be assigned to the functions can be expressed algebraically by means of boolean functions as is shown in the first column of table the boolean expressions listed are simplified to their minimum number of literals although each function can be expressed in terms of the boolean operators and or and not there is no reason one cannot assign special operator symbols for expressing the other functions such operator symbols are listed in the second column of table however of all the new symbols shown only the exclusive or symbol is in common use by digital designers each of the functions in table is listed with an accompanying name and comment that explains the function in some the functions listed can be subdivided into three categories two functions that produce constant or four functions with unary operations complement and transfer ten functions with binary operators that define eight different operations and or nand nor exclusive or equivalence inhibition and implication table truth tables for the functions of two binary variables xy the symbol is also used to indicate the exclusive or operator g xy the symbol for the and function is sometimes omitted from the product of two variables g xy section other logic operations table boolean expressions for the functions of two variables boolean functions operator name comments symbol binary constant y null and xy and but not xy y inhibition transfer but not xy x inhibition transfer or but not both xy exclusive or or xy xy y or not or x y nor y equals y equivalence not xy xy xy complement if then x implication not xy complement if then x y implication not and nand binary constant xy identity constants for binary functions can be equal to only or the complement function produces the complement of each of the binary variables function that is equal to an input variable has been given the name transfer because the variable or is transferred through the gate that forms the function without changing its value of the eight binary operators two inhibition and implication are used by logicians but are seldom used in computer logic the and and or operators have been mentioned in conjunction with boolean algebra the other four functions are used extensively in the design of digital systems the nor function is the complement of the or function and its name is an abbreviation of not or similarly nand is the complement of and and is an abbreviation of not and the exclusive or abbreviated xor is similar to or but excludes the combination of both and being equal to it holds only when and differ in value it is sometimes referred to as the binary difference operator equivalence is function that is when the two binary variables are equal e when both are or both are the exclusive or and equivalence functions are the complements of each other this can be easily verified by inspecting table the truth table for exclusive or is and for equivalence is and these two functions are the complements of each other for this reason the equivalence function is called exclusive nor abbreviated xnor boolean algebra as defined in section has two binary operators which we have called and and or and unary operator not complement from the definitions we have deduced number of properties of these operators and now have defined other binary operators in terms of them there is nothing unique about this procedure we could have just as well started with the operator nor for example and later defined and or and not in terms of it there are nevertheless good reasons for introducing boolean algebra in the way it has been introduced the concepts of and or and not are familiar and are used by people to express everyday logical ideas moreover the huntington postulates reflect the dual nature of the algebra emphasizing the symmetry of and with respect to each other digital logic gates since boolean functions are expressed in terms of and or and not operations it is easier to implement boolean function with these type of gates still the possibility of constructing gates for the other logic operations is of practical interest factors to be weighed in considering the construction of other types of logic gates are the feasibility and economy of producing the gate with physical components the possibility of extending the gate to more than two inputs the basic properties of the binary operator such as commutativity and associativity and the ability of the gate to implement boolean functions alone or in conjunction with other gates of the functions defined in table two are equal to constant and four are repeated there are only functions left to be considered as candidates for logic gates twoinhibition and implicationare not commutative or associative and thus are impractical to use as standard logic gates the other eightcomplement transfer and or nand nor exclusive or and equivalenceare used as standard gates in digital design the graphic symbols and truth tables of the eight gates are shown in fig each gate has one or two binary input variables designated by and and one binary output variable designated by the and or and inverter circuits were defined in fig the inverter circuit inverts the logic sense of binary variable producing the not or complement function the small circle in the output of the graphic symbol of an inverter referred to as bubble designates the logic complement the triangle symbol by itself designates buffer circuit buffer produces the transfer function but does not produce logic operation since the binary value of the output is equal to the binary value of the input this circuit is used for power amplification of the signal and is equivalent to two inverters connected in cascade the nand function is the complement of the and function as indicated by graphic symbol that consists of an and graphic symbol followed by small circle the nor function is the complement of the or function and uses an or graphic symbol followed by small circle nand and nor gates are used extensively as standard logic gates and are in fact far more popular than the and and or gates this is because nand and nor gates are easily constructed with transistor circuits and because digital circuits can be easily implemented with them section digital logic gates name graphic algebraic truth symbol function table and f fxy xy y or f fxy f y fx f xy xy inverter buffer x nand xf nor f y xf exclusive or f xy xy xor xy xy exclusive nor f xy xy or y y equivalence xy xy xy figure digital logic gates the exclusive or gate has graphic symbol similar to that of the or gate except for the additional curved line on the input side the equivalence or exclusive nor gate is the complement of the exclusive or as indicated by the small circle on the output side of the graphic symbol extension to multiple inputs the gates shown in fig for the inverter and buffercan be extended to have more than two inputs gate can be extended to have multiple inputs if the binary operation it represents is commutative and associative the and and or operations defined in boolean algebra possess these two properties for the or function we have commutative and associative which indicates that the gate inputs can be interchanged and that the or function can be extended to three or more variables the nand and nor functions are commutative and their gates can be extended to have more than two inputs provided that the definition of the operation is modified slightly the difficulty is that the nand and nor operators are not associative e t z t t as shown in fig and the following equations t z z xz yz t t y xy xz to overcome this difficulty we define the multiple nor or nand gate as complemented or or and gate thus by definition we have t t c c xyz the graphic symbols for the three input gates are shown in fig in writing cascaded nor and nand operations one must use the correct parentheses to signify the proper sequence of the gates to demonstrate this principle consider the circuit of fig the boolean function for the circuit must be written as abc de abc de the second expression is obtained from one of demorgans theorems it also shows that an expression in sum of products form can be implemented with nand gates nand and nor gates are discussed further in section the exclusive or and equivalence gates are both commutative and associative and can be extended to more than two inputs however multiple input exclusive or gates are uncommon from the hardware standpoint in fact even two input function is usually constructed with other types of gates moreover the definition of the function must be modified when extended to more than two variables exclusive or is an odd function e it is equal to if the input variables have an odd number of the construction section digital logic gates y y y x z z z figure demonstrating the nonassociativity of the nor operator t z t t y y xyz z nor gate nand gate b f abc de abc de e cascaded nand gates figure multiple input and cascaded nor and nand gates of three input exclusive or function is shown in fig this function is normally implemented by cascading two input gates as shown in graphically it can be represented with single three input gate as shown in the truth table in clearly indicates that the output is equal to if only one input is equal to or if all three inputs are equal to e when the total number of in the input variables is odd exclusive or gates are discussed further in section positive and negative logic the binary signal at the inputs and outputs of any gate has one of two values except during transition one signal value represents logic and the other logic since two signal values are assigned to two logic values there exist two different assignments of xyz y fxyz using gates y fxyz gate truth table figure three input exclusive or gate logic signal logic signal value value value value h l positive logic negative logic figure signal assignment and logic polarity signal level to logic value as shown in fig the higher signal level is designated by and the lower signal level by choosing the high level to represent logic defines positive logic system choosing the low level to represent logic defines negative logic system the terms positive and negative are somewhat misleading since both signals may be positive or both may be negative it is not the actual values of the signals that determine the type of logic but rather the assignment of logic values to the relative amplitudes of the two signal levels hardware digital gates are defined in terms of signal values such as and it is up to the user to decide on positive or negative logic polarity consider for example the electronic gate shown in fig the truth table for this gate is listed in fig it specifies the physical behavior of the gate when is and is the truth table of fig assumes positive logic assignment with and this truth table is the same as the one for the and operation the graphic symbol for positive logic and gate is shown in fig now consider the negative logic assignment for the same physical gate with and the result is the truth table of fig this table represents the or operation even though the entries are reversed the graphic symbol for the negative logic or gate is shown in fig the small triangles in the inputs and output section digital logic gates xy ll x digital lh hl gate hh y truth table gate block diagram with and xy x y positive logic and gate truth table for positive logic xy x y truth table for negative logic or gate negative logic figure demonstration of positive and negative logic designate polarity indicator the presence of which along terminal signifies that negative logic is assumed for the signal thus the same physical gate can operate either as positive logic and gate or as negative logic or gate the conversion from positive logic to negative logic and vice versa is essentially an operation that changes to and to in both the inputs and the output of gate since this operation produces the dual of function the change of all terminals from one polarity to the other results in taking the dual of the function the upshot is that all and operations are converted to or operations or graphic symbols and vice versa in addition one must not forget to include the polarity indicator triangle in the graphic symbols when negative logic is assumed in this book we will not use negative logic gates and will assume that all gates operate with positive logic assignment integrated circuits an integrated circuit ic is fabricated on die of silicon semiconductor crystal called chip containing the electronic components for constructing digital gates the complex chemical and physical processes used to form semiconductor circuit are not subject of this book the various gates are interconnected inside the chip to form the required circuit the chip is mounted in ceramic or plastic container and connections are welded to external pins to form the integrated circuit the number of pins may range from on small ic package to several thousand on larger package each ic has numeric designation printed on the surface of the package for identification vendors provide data books catalogs and internet websites that contain descriptions and information about the ics that they manufacture levels of integration digital ics are often categorized according to the complexity of their circuits as measured by the number of logic gates in single package the differentiation between those chips which have few internal gates and those having hundreds of thousands of gates is made by customary reference to package as being either small medium large or very large scale integration device small scale integration ssi devices contain several independent gates in single package the inputs and outputs of the gates are connected directly to the pins in the package the number of gates is usually fewer than and is limited by the number of pins available in the ic medium scale integration msi devices have complexity of approximately to gates in single package they usually perform specific elementary digital operations msi digital functions are introduced in chapter as decoders adders and multiplexers and in chapter as registers and counters large scale integration lsi devices contain thousands of gates in single package they include digital systems such as processors memory chips and programmable logic devices some lsi components are presented in chapter very large scale integration vlsi devices now contain millions of gates within single package examples are large memory arrays and complex microcomputer chips because of their small size and low cost vlsi devices have revolutionized the computer system design technology giving the designer the capability to create structures that were previously uneconomical to build digital logic families digital integrated circuits are classified not only by their complexity or logical operation but also by the specific circuit technology to which they belong the circuit technology is referred to as digital logic family each logic family has its own basic electronic circuit upon which more complex digital circuits and components are developed the basic circuit in each technology is nand nor or inverter gate the electronic section integrated circuits components employed in the construction of the basic circuit are usually used to name the technology many different logic families of digital integrated circuits have been introduced commercially the following are the most popular ttl transistorctransistor logic ecl emitter coupled logic mos metal oxide semiconductor cmos complementary metal oxide semiconductor ttl is logic family that has been in use for years and is considered to be standard ecl has an advantage in systems requiring high speed operation mos is suitable for circuits that need high component density and cmos is preferable in systems requiring low power consumption such as digital cameras personal media players and other handheld portable devices low power consumption is essential for vlsi design therefore cmos has become the dominant logic family while ttl and ecl continue to decline in use the most important parameters distinguishing logic families are listed below cmos integrated circuits are discussed briefly in the appendix fan out specifies the number of standard loads that the output of typical gate can drive without impairing its normal operation standard load is usually defined as the amount of current needed by an input of another similar gate in the same family fan in is the number of inputs available in gate power dissipation is the power consumed by the gate that must be available from the power supply propagation delay is the average transition delay time for signal to propagate from input to output for example if the input of an inverter switches from to the output will switch from to but after time determined by the propagation delay of the device the operating speed is inversely proportional to the propagation delay noise margin is the maximum external noise voltage added to an input signal that does not cause an undesirable change in the circuit output computer aided design of vlsi circuits integrated circuits having submicron geometric features are manufactured by optically projecting patterns of light onto silicon wafers prior to exposure the wafers are coated with photoresistive material that either hardens or softens when exposed to light removing extraneous photoresist leaves patterns of exposed silicon the exposed regions are then implanted with dopant atoms to create semiconductor material having the electrical properties of transistors and the logical properties of gates the design process translates functional specification or description of the circuit e what it must do into physical specification or description how it must be implemented in silicon the design of digital systems with vlsi circuits containing millions of transistors and gates is an enormous and formidable task systems of this complexity are usually impossible to develop and verify without the assistance of computer aided design cad tools which consist of software programs that support computer based representations of circuits and aid in the development of digital hardware by automating the design process electronic design automation eda covers all phases of the design of integrated circuits typical design flow for creating vlsi circuits consists of sequence of steps beginning with design entry g entering schematic and culminating with the generation of the database that contains the photomask used to fabricate the ic there are variety of options available for creating the physical realization of digital circuit in silicon the designer can choose between an application specific integrated circuit asic field programmable gate array fpga programmable logic device pld and full custom ic with each of these devices comes set of cad tools that provide the necessary software to facilitate the hardware fabrication of the unit each of these technologies has market niche determined by the size of the market and the unit cost of the devices that are required to implement design some cad systems include an editing program for creating and modifying schematic diagrams on computer screen this process is called schematic capture or schematic entry with the aid of menus keyboard commands and mouse schematic editor can draw circuit diagrams of digital circuits on the computer screen components can be placed on the screen from list in an internal library and can then be connected with lines that represent wires the schematic entry software creates and manages database containing the information produced with the schematic primitive gates and functional blocks have associated models that allow the functionality e logical behavior and timing of the circuit to be verified verification is performed by applying inputs to the circuit and using logic simulator to determine and display the outputs in text or waveform format an important development in the design of digital systems is the use of hardware description language hdl such language resembles computer programming language but is specifically oriented to describing digital hardware it represents logic diagrams and other digital information in textual form to describe the functionality and structure of circuit moreover the hdl description of circuits functionality can be abstract without reference to specific hardware thereby freeing designer to devote attention to higher level functional detail g under certain conditions the circuit must detect particular pattern of and in serial bit stream of data rather than transistor level detail hdl based models of circuit or system are simulated to check and verify its functionality before it is submitted to fabrication thereby reducing the risk and waste of manufacturing circuit that fails to operate correctly in tandem with the emergence of hdl based design languages tools have been developed to automatically and optimally synthesize the logic described by an hdl model of circuit these two advances in technology have led to an almost total reliance by industry on hdl based synthesis tools and methodologies for the design of the circuits of complex digital systems two hdlsverilog and vhdlhave been approved as standards by the institute of electronics and electrical engineers ieee and are in use by design teams worldwide the verilog hdl is introduced in section and because of its importance we

level implementation of the boolean functions describing digital circuit this task is well understood but is difficult to execute by manual methods when the logic has more than few inputs fortunately computer based logic synthesis tools can minimize large set of boolean equations efficiently and quickly nevertheless it is important that designer understand the underlying mathematical description and solution of the problem this chapter serves as foundation for your understanding of that important topic and will enable you to execute manual design of simple circuits preparing you for skilled use of modern design tools the chapter will also introduce hardware description language that is used by modern design tools the map method the complexity of the digital logic gates that implement boolean function is directly related to the complexity of the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented although the truth table representation of function is unique when it is expressed algebraically it can appear in many different but equivalent forms boolean expressions may be simplified by algebraic means as discussed in section however this procedure of minimization is awkward because it lacks specific rules to predict each succeeding step in the manipulative process the map method presented here provides simple straightforward procedure for minimizing boolean functions this method may be regarded as pictorial form of truth table the map method is also known as the karnaugh map or map k map is diagram made up of squares with each square representing one minterm of the function that is to be minimized since any boolean function can be expressed as sum of minterms it follows that boolean function is recognized graphically in the map from the area enclosed by those squares whose minterms are included in the function in fact the map presents visual diagram of all possible ways function may be expressed in standard form by recognizing various patterns the user can derive alternative algebraic expressions for the same function from which the simplest can be selected the simplified expressions produced by the map are always in one of the two standard forms sum of products or product of sums it will be assumed that the simplest algebraic expression is an algebraic expression with minimum number of terms and with the smallest possible number of literals in each term this expression produces circuit diagram with minimum number of gates and the minimum number of inputs to each gate we will see subsequently that the simplest expression is not unique it is sometimes possible to find two or more expressions that satisfy the minimization criteria in that case either solution is satisfactory two variable map the two variable map is shown in fig there are four minterms for two variables hence the map consists of four squares one for each minterm the map is redrawn in to show the relationship between the squares and the two variables and the and marked in each row and column designate the values of variables variable appears primed in row and unprimed in row similarly appears primed in column and unprimed in column if we mark the squares whose minterms belong to given function the two variable map becomes another useful way to represent any one of the boolean functions of two variables as an example the function xy is shown in fig since xy is equal to is placed inside the square that belongs to similarly the function is represented in the map of fig by three squares marked with these squares are found from the minterms of the function xy xy xy x y xy xy xy xy figure two variable map section the map method y y y xy y figure representation of functions in the map the three squares could also have been determined from the intersection of variable in the second row and variable in the second column which encloses the area belonging to or in each example the minterms at which the function is asserted are marked with three variable map three variable map is shown in fig there are eight minterms for three binary variables therefore the map consists of eight squares note that the minterms are arranged not in binary sequence but in sequence similar to the gray code table the characteristic of this sequence is that only one bit changes in value from one adjacent column to the next the map drawn in part is marked with numbers in each row and each column to show the relationship between the squares and the three variables for example the square assigned to corresponds to row and column these two numbers are concatenated they give the binary number whose decimal equivalent is each cell of the map corresponds to unique minterm so another way of looking at square xyz is to consider it to be in the row marked and the column belonging to yz column note that there are four squares in which each variable is equal to and four in which each is equal to the variable appears unprimed in the former four yz x xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz figure three variable map squares and primed in the latter for convenience we write the variable with its letter symbol under the four squares in which it is unprimed to understand the usefulness of the map in simplifying boolean functions we must recognize the basic property possessed by adjacent squares any two adjacent squares in the map differ by only one variable which is primed in one square and unprimed in the other for example and lie in two adjacent squares variable is primed in and unprimed in whereas the other two variables are the same in both squares from the postulates of boolean algebra it follows that the sum of two minterms in adjacent squares can be simplified to single product term consisting of only two literals to clarify this concept consider the sum of two adjacent squares such as and xyz xyz xz xz here the two squares differ by the variable which can be removed when the sum of the two minterms is formed thus any two minterms in adjacent squares vertically or horizontally but not diagonally adjacent that are ored together will cause removal of the dissimilar variable the next four examples explain the procedure for minimizing boolean function with k map example simplify the boolean function first is marked in each minterm square that represents the function this is shown in fig in which the squares for minterms and are marked with the next step is to find possible adjacent squares these are indicated in the map by two shaded rectangles each enclosing two the upper right rectangle represents the area enclosed by xy this area is determined by observing that the two square area is in row corresponding to and the last two columns corresponding to similarly the lower left rectangle represents the product term xy the second row represents and the two left columns represent the sum of four minterms can be replaced by sum of yz xy xy figure map for example xy xy section the map method only two product terms the logical sum of these two product terms gives the simplified expression xy xy in certain cases two squares in the map are considered to be adjacent even though they do not touch each other in fig is adjacent to and is adjacent to because their minterms differ by one variable this difference can be readily verified algebraically xyz xyz xz xz xyz xyz xz xz consequently we must modify the definition of adjacent squares to include this and other similar cases we do so by considering the map as being drawn on surface in which the right and left edges touch each other to form adjacent squares example simplify the boolean function the map for this function is shown in fig there are four squares marked with one for each minterm of the function two adjacent squares are combined in the third column to give two literal term yz the remaining two squares with are also adjacent by the new definition these two squares when combined give the two literal term xz the simplified function then becomes yz xz yz x yz xyz xyz note xyz xyz xz figure map for example yz xz consider now any combination of four adjacent squares in the three variable map any such combination represents the logical sum of four minterms and results in an expression with only one literal as an example the logical sum of the four adjacent minterms and reduces to the single literal term xyz xyz xyz xyz xz xz xz xz x the number of adjacent squares that may be combined must always represent number that is power of two such as and as more adjacent squares are combined we obtain product term with fewer literals one square represents one minterm giving term with three literals two adjacent squares represent term with two literals four adjacent squares represent term with one literal eight adjacent squares encompass the entire map and produce function that is always equal to example simplify the boolean function the map for is shown in fig first we combine the four adjacent squares in the first and last columns to give the single literal term the remaining single square representing minterm is combined with an adjacent square that has already been used once this is not only permissible but rather desirable because the two adjacent squares give the two literal term xy and the single square represents the three literal minterm xyz the simplified function is xy yz yz m m xy note yz yz figure map for example xy section the map method if function is not expressed in sum of minterms form it is possible to use the map to obtain the minterms of the function and then simplify the function to an expression with minimum number of terms it is necessary however to make sure that the algebraic expression is in sum of products form each product term can be plotted in the map in one two or more squares the minterms of the function are then read directly from the map example for the boolean function ac ab abc bc express this function as sum of minterms find the minimal sum of products expression note that is sum of products three product terms in the expression have two literals and are represented in three variable map by two squares each the two squares corresponding to the first term ac are found in fig from the coincidence of first row and two middle columns to give squares and note that in marking in the squares it is possible to find already placed there from preceding term this happens with the second term ab which has in squares and square is common with the first term ac though so only one is marked in it continuing in this fashion we determine that the term abc belongs in square corresponding to minterm and the term bc has two in squares and the function has total of five minterms as indicated by the five in the map of fig the minterms are read directly from the map to be and the function can be expressed in sum of minterms form as the sum of products expression as originally given has too many terms it can be simplified as shown in the map to an expression with only two terms ab bc ab c figure map of example ac ab abc bc ab four variable map the map for boolean functions of four binary variables is shown in fig in fig are listed the minterms and the squares assigned to each in fig the map is redrawn to show the relationship between the squares and the four variables the rows and columns are numbered in gray code sequence with only one digit changing value between two adjacent rows or columns the minterm corresponding to each square can be obtained from the concatenation of the row number with the column number for example the numbers of the third row and the second column when concatenated give the binary number the binary equivalent of decimal thus the square in the third row and second column represents minterm the map minimization of four variable boolean functions is similar to the method used to minimize three variable functions adjacent squares are defined to be squares next to each other in addition the map is considered to lie on surface with the top and bottom edges as well as the right and left edges touching each other to form adjacent squares for example and form adjacent squares as do and the combination of adjacent squares that is useful during the simplification process is easily determined from inspection of the four variable map one square represents one minterm giving term with four literals two adjacent squares represent term with three literals four adjacent squares represent term with two literals eight adjacent squares represent term with one literal sixteen adjacent squares produce function that is always equal to no other combination of squares can simplify the function the next two examples show the procedure used to simplify four variable boolean functions yz wx wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz wxyz figure four variable map section four variable map example simplify the boolean function since the function has four variables four variable map must be used the minterms listed in the sum are marked by in the map of fig eight adjacent squares marked with can be combined to form the one literal term the remaining three on the right cannot be combined to give simplified term they must be combined as two or four adjacent squares the larger the number of squares combined the smaller is the number of literals in the term in this example the top two on the right are combined with the top two on the left to give the term wz note that it is permissible to use the same square more than once we are now left with square marked by in the third row and fourth column square instead of taking this square alone which will give term with four literals we combine it with squares already used to form an area of four adjacent squares these squares make up the two middle rows and the two end columns giving the term xz the simplified function is wz xz yz wx wyz wyz xyz xyz y note wyz wyz wz xyz xyz xz figure map for example w wz xz example simplify the boolean function abc bcd abcd abc the area in the map covered by this function consists of the squares marked with in fig the function has four variables and as expressed consists of three terms with abc cd abcd ab abcd acd a abcd abcd abc note abcd abcd abd abcd abcd abd abd abd bd abc abc bc figure map for example abc bcd abcd abc bd bc acd three literals each and one term with four literals each term with three literals is represented in the map by two squares for example abc is represented in squares and the function can be simplified in the map by taking the in the four corners to give the term bd this is possible because these four squares are adjacent when the map is drawn in surface with top and bottom edges as well as left and right edges touching one another the two left hand in the top row are combined with the two in the bottom row to give the term bc the remaining may be combined in twosquare area to give the term acd the simplified function is bd bc acd prime implicants in choosing adjacent squares in map we must ensure that all the minterms of the function are covered when we combine the squares the number of terms in the expression is minimized and there are no redundant terms e minterms already covered by other terms sometimes there may be two or more expressions that satisfy the simplification criteria the procedure for combining squares in the map may be made more systematic if we understand the meaning of two special types of terms prime implicant is product term obtained by combining the maximum possible number of adjacent squares in the map if minterm in square is covered by only one prime implicant that prime implicant is said to be essential section four variable map the prime implicants of function can be obtained from the map by combining all possible maximum numbers of squares this means that single on map represents prime implicant if it is not adjacent to any other two adjacent form prime implicant provided that they are not within group of four adjacent squares four adjacent form prime implicant if they are not within group of eight adjacent squares and so on the essential prime implicants are found by looking at each square marked with and checking the number of prime implicants that cover it the prime implicant is essential if it is the only prime implicant that covers the minterm consider the following four variable boolean function the minterms of the function are marked with in the maps of fig the partial map fig shows two essential prime implicants each formed by collapsing four cells into term having only two literals one term is essential because there is only one way to include minterm within four adjacent squares these four squares define the term bd similarly there is only one way that minterm can be combined with four adjacent squares and this gives the second term bd the two essential prime implicants cover eight minterms the three minterms that were omitted from the partial map and must be considered next figure shows all possible ways that the three minterms can be covered with prime implicants minterm can be covered with either prime implicant cd or prime implicant bc minterm can be covered with either ad or ab minterm is covered with any one of the four prime implicants the simplified expression is obtained from the logical sum of the two essential prime implicants and any two prime implicants cd ab cd ab abcd abcd cd ad bd b bc a abcd abcd d ab note abcd abcd abd abcd abcd abd abd abd bd essential prime implicants prime implicants cd bc bd and bd ad and ab figure simplification using prime implicants that cover minterms and there are four possible ways that the function can be expressed with four product terms of two literals each bd bd cd ad bd bd cd ab bd bd bc ad bd bd bc ab the previous example has demonstrated that the identification of the prime implicants in the map helps in determining the alternatives that are available for obtaining simplified expression the procedure for finding the simplified expression from the map requires that we first determine all the essential prime implicants the simplified expression is obtained from the logical sum of all the essential prime implicants plus other prime implicants that may be needed to cover any remaining minterms not covered by the essential prime implicants occasionally there may be more than one way of combining squares and each combination may produce an equally simplified expression five variable map maps for more than four variables are not as simple to use as maps for four or fewer variables five variable map needs squares and six variable map needs squares when the number of variables becomes large the number of squares becomes excessive and the geometry for combining adjacent squares becomes more involved maps for more than four variables are difficult to use and will not be considered here product of sums simplification the minimized boolean functions derived from the map in all previous examples were expressed in sum of products form with minor modification the product of sums form can be obtained the procedure for obtaining minimized function in product of sums form follows from the basic properties of boolean functions the placed in the squares of the map represent the minterms of the function the minterms not included in the standard sum of products form of function denote the complement of the function from this observation we see that the complement of function is represented in the map by the squares not marked by if we mark the empty squares by and combine them into valid adjacent squares we obtain simplified sum of products expression of the complement of the function e of the complement of gives us back the function in product of sums form consequence of demorgans theorem because of the generalized demorgans theorem the function so obtained is automatically in product of sums form the best way to show this is by example section product of sums simplification example simplify the following boolean function into sum of products form and product of sums form the marked in the map of fig represent all the minterms of the function the squares marked with represent the minterms not included in and therefore denote the complement of combining the squares with gives the simplified function in sum of products form bd bc acd if the squares marked with are combined as shown in the diagram we obtain the simplified complemented function ab cd bd applying demorgans theorem by taking the dual and complementing each literal as described in section we obtain the simplified function in productof sums form the gate level implementation of the simplified expressions obtained in example is shown in fig the sum of products expression is implemented in with group of and gates one for each and term the outputs of the and gates are connected to the inputs of single or gate the same function is implemented in in its product of sums ab cd cd bcd ab bcd d note bcd bcd bd figure map for example bd bc acd a b c c a b d d bd bc acd figure gate implementations of the function of example table truth table of function x z form with group of or gates one for each or term the outputs of the or gates are connected to the inputs of single and gate in each case it is assumed that the input variables are directly available in their complement so inverters are not needed the configuration pattern established in fig is the general form by which any boolean function is implemented when expressed in one of the standard forms and gates are connected to single or gate when in sum of products form or gates are connected to single and gate when in product of sums form either configuration forms two levels of gates thus the implementation of function in standard form is said to be two level implementation the two level implementation may not be practical depending on the number of inputs to the gates example showed the procedure for obtaining the product of sums simplification when the function is originally expressed in the sum of minterms canonical form the procedure is also valid when the function is originally expressed in the productof maxterms canonical form consider for example the truth table that defines the function in table in sum of minterms form this function is expressed as section product of sums simplification yz x xz xz figure map for the function of table in product of maxterms form it is expressed as in other words the of the function represent the minterms and the represent the maxterms the map for this function is shown in fig one can start simplifying the function by first marking the for each minterm that the function is the remaining squares are marked by if instead the product of maxterms is initially given one can start marking in those squares listed in the function the remaining squares are then marked by once the and are marked the function can be simplified in either one of the standard forms for the sum of products we combine the to obtain xz xz for the product of sums we combine the to obtain the simplified complemented function xz xz which shows that the exclusive or function is the complement of the equivalence function section taking the complement of we obtain the simplified function in product of sums form to enter function expressed in product of sums form into the map use the complement of the function to find the squares that are to be marked by for example the function can be entered into the map by first taking its complement namely abc bd and then marking in the squares representing the minterms of the remaining squares are marked with dont care conditions the logical sum of the minterms associated with boolean function specifies the conditions under which the function is equal to the function is equal to for the rest of the minterms this pair of conditions assumes that all the combinations of the values for the variables of the function are valid in practice in some applications the function is not specified for certain combinations of the variables as an example the four bit binary code for the decimal digits has six combinations that are not used and consequently are considered to be unspecified functions that have unspecified outputs for some input combinations are called incompletely specified functions in most applications we simply dont care what value is assumed by the function for the unspecified minterms for this reason it is customary to call the unspecified minterms of function dont care conditions these dont care conditions can be used on map to provide further simplification of the boolean expression dont care minterm is combination of variables whose logical value is not specified such minterm cannot be marked with in the map because it would require that the function always be for such combination likewise putting on the square requires the function to be to distinguish the dont care condition from and an is used thus an inside square in the map indicates that we dont care whether the value of or is assigned to for the particular minterm in choosing adjacent squares to simplify the function in map the dont care minterms may be assumed to be either or when simplifying the function we can choose to include each dont care minterm with either the or the depending on which combination gives the simplest expression example simplify the boolean function which has the dont care conditions the minterms of are the variable combinations that make the function equal to the minterms of are the dont care minterms that may be assigned either or the map simplification is shown in fig the minterms of are marked by those of are marked by xs and the remaining squares are filled with to get the simplified expression in sum of products form we must include all five in the map but we may or may not include any of the xs depending on the way the function is simplified the term yz covers the four minterms in the third column the remaining minterm can be combined section dont care conditions yz yz wx wx x x wx wz x x w z yz yz yz wx yz wz figure example with dont care conditions with minterm to give the three literal term wxz however by including one or two adjacent xs we can combine four adjacent squares to give two literal term in fig dont care minterms and are included with the resulting in the simplified function yz wx in fig dont care minterm is included with the and the simplified function is now yz wz either one of the preceding two expressions satisfies the conditions stated for this example the previous example has shown that the dont care minterms in the map are initially marked with xs and are considered as being either or the choice between and is made depending on the way the incompletely specified function is simplified once the choice is made the simplified function obtained will consist of sum of minterms that includes those minterms which were initially unspecified and have been chosen to be included with the consider the two simplified expressions obtained in example yz wx yz wz both expressions include minterms and that make the function equal to the dont care minterms and are treated differently in each expression the first expression includes minterms and with the and leaves minterm with the the second expression includes minterm with the and leaves minterms and with the the two expressions represent two functions that are not algebraically equal both cover the specified minterms of the function but each covers different dont care minterms as far as the incompletely specified function is concerned either expression is acceptable because the only difference is in the value of for the dont care minterms it is also possible to obtain simplified product of sums expression for the function of fig in this case the only way to combine the is to include dont care minterms and with the to give simplified complemented function wy taking the complement of gives the simplified expression in product of sums form w in this case we include minterms and with the and minterm with the nand and nor implementation digital circuits are frequently constructed with nand or nor gates rather than with and and or gates nand and nor gates are easier to fabricate with electronic components and are the basic gates used in all ic digital logic families because of the prominence of nand and nor gates in the design of digital circuits rules and procedures have been developed for the conversion from boolean functions given in terms of and or and not into equivalent nand and nor logic diagrams nand circuits the nand gate is said to be universal gate because any logic circuit can be implemented with it to show that any boolean function can be implemented with nand gates we need only show that the logical operations of and or and complement can be obtained with nand gates alone this is indeed shown in fig the complement operation is obtained from one input nand gate that behaves exactly like an inverter the and operation requires two nand gates the first produces the nand operation and the second inverts the logical sense of the signal the or operation is achieved through nand gate with additional inverters in each input convenient way to implement boolean function with nand gates is to obtain the simplified boolean function in terms of boolean operators and then convert the function to nand logic the conversion of an algebraic expression from and or and complement to nand can be done by simple circuit manipulation techniques that change andcor diagrams to nand diagrams to facilitate the conversion to nand logic it is convenient to define an alternative graphic symbol for the gate two equivalent graphic symbols for the nand gate are shown in fig the and invert symbol has been defined previously and consists section nand and nor implementation inverter x xy and x xy y or figure logic operations with nand gates xyz x z xyz y z and invert invert or figure two graphic symbols for three input nand gate of an and graphic symbol followed by small circle negation indicator referred to as bubble alternatively it is possible to represent nand gate by an or graphic symbol that is preceded by bubble in each input the invert or symbol for the nand gate follows demorgans theorem and the convention that the negation indicator bubble denotes complementation the two graphic symbols representations are useful in the analysis and design of nand circuits when both symbols are mixed in the same diagram the circuit is said to be in mixed notation two level implementation the implementation of boolean functions with nand gates requires that the functions be in sum of products form to see the relationship between sum of products expression and its equivalent nand implementation consider the logic diagrams drawn in fig all three diagrams are equivalent and implement the function ab cd the function is implemented in fig with and and or gates in fig the and gates are replaced by nand gates and the or gate is replaced by nand gate with an or invert graphic symbol remember that bubble denotes complementation and two bubbles along the same line represent double complementation so both can be removed removing the bubbles on the gates of produces the circuit of therefore the two diagrams implement the same function and are equivalent b c a b f c d figure three ways to implement ab cd in fig the output nand gate is redrawn with the and invert graphic symbol in drawing nand logic diagrams the circuit shown in either fig or is acceptable the one in fig is in mixed notation and represents more direct relationship to the boolean expression it implements the nand implementation in fig can be verified algebraically the function it implements can easily be converted to sum ofproducts form by demorgans theorem ab cd ab cd example implement the following boolean function with nand gates the first step is to simplify the function into sum of products form this is done by means of the map of fig from which the simplified function is obtained xy xy the two level nand implementation is shown in fig in mixed notation note that input must have one input nand gate an inverter to compensate for the bubble in the second level gate an alternative way of drawing the logic diagram is given in fig here all the nand gates are drawn with the same graphic symbol the inverter with input has been removed but the input variable is complemented and denoted by section nand and nor implementation yz xy xy xy xy z x y x f f z figure solution to example the procedure described in the previous example indicates that boolean function can be implemented with two levels of nand gates the procedure for obtaining the logic diagram from boolean function is as follows simplify the function and express it in sum of products form draw nand gate for each product term of the expression that has at least two literals the inputs to each nand gate are the literals of the term this procedure produces group of first level gates draw single gate using the and invert or the invert or graphic symbol in the second level with inputs coming from outputs of first level gates term with single literal requires an inverter in the first level however if the single literal is complemented it can be connected directly to an input of the secondlevel nand gate multilevel nand circuits the standard form of expressing boolean functions results in two level implementation there are occasions however when the design of digital systems results in gating structures with three or more levels the most common procedure in the design of multilevel circuits is to express the boolean function in terms of and or and complement operations the function can then be implemented with and and or gates after that if necessary it can be converted into an all nand circuit consider for example the boolean function cd bc d a b andcor gates d a b nand gates figure implementing cd bc although it is possible to remove the parentheses and reduce the expression into standard sum of products form we choose to implement it as multilevel circuit for illustration the andcor implementation is shown in fig there are four levels of gating in the circuit the first level has two and gates the second level has an or gate followed by an and gate in the third level and an or gate in the fourth level logic diagram with pattern of alternating levels of and and or gates can easily be converted into nand circuit with the use of mixed notation shown in fig procedure is to change every and gate to an and invert graphic symbol and every or gate to an invert or graphic symbol the nand circuit performs the same logic as the andcor diagram as long as there are two bubbles along the same line the bubble associated with input causes an extra complementation which must be compensated for by changing the input literal to the general procedure for converting multilevel andcor diagram into an all nand diagram using mixed notation is as follows convert all and gates to nand gates with and invert graphic symbols convert all or gates to nand gates with invert or graphic symbols check all the bubbles in the diagram for every bubble that is not compensated by another small circle along the same line insert an inverter one input nand gate or complement the input literal as another example consider the multilevel boolean function ab ab section nand and nor implementation b b c andcor gates b b c nand gates figure implementing ab ab the andcor implementation of this function is shown in fig with three levels of gating the conversion to nand with mixed notation is presented in fig of the diagram the two additional bubbles associated with inputs and cause these two literals to be complemented to and the bubble in the output nand gate complements the output value so we need to insert an inverter gate at the output in order to complement the signal again and get the original value back nor implementation the nor operation is the dual of the nand operation therefore all procedures and rules for nor logic are the duals of the corresponding procedures and rules developed for nand logic the nor gate is another universal gate that can be used to implement any boolean function the implementation of the complement or and and operations with nor gates is shown in fig the complement operation is obtained from oneinput nor gate that behaves exactly like an inverter the or operation requires two nor gates and the and operation is obtained with nor gate that has inverters in each input the two graphic symbols for the mixed notation are shown in fig or invert symbol defines the nor operation as an or followed by complement the invert and symbol complements each input and then performs an and operation the two symbols designate the same nor operation and are logically identical because of demorgans theorem inverter x xy or x y xy and figure logic operations with nor gates y xyz y y z or invert invert and figure two graphic symbols for the nor gate two level implementation with nor gates requires that the function be simplified into product of sums form remember that the simplified product of sums expression is obtained from the map by combining the and complementing product of sums expression is implemented with first level of or gates that produce the sum terms followed by second level and gate to produce the product the transformation from the orcand diagram to nor diagram is achieved by changing the or gates to nor gates with or invert graphic symbols and the and gate to nor gate with an invert and graphic symbol single literal term going into the second level gate must be complemented figure shows the nor implementation of function expressed as product of sums e the orcand pattern can easily be detected by the removal of the bubbles along the same line variable is complemented to compensate for the third bubble at the input of the second level gate the procedure for converting multilevel andcor diagram to an all nor diagram is similar to the one presented for nand gates for the nor case we must convert each or gate to an or invert symbol and each and gate to an invert and symbol any bubble that is not compensated by another bubble along the same line needs an inverter or the complementation of the input literal the transformation of the andcor diagram of fig into nor diagram is shown in fig the boolean function for this circuit is ab ab section other two level implementations b f e figure implementing e b a c figure implementing ab ab with nor gates the equivalent andcor diagram can be recognized from the nor diagram by removing all the bubbles to compensate for the bubbles in four inputs it is necessary to complement the corresponding input literals other two level implementations the types of gates most often found in integrated circuits are nand and nor gates for this reason nand and nor logic implementations are the most important from practical point of view some but not all nand or nor gates allow the possibility of wire connection between the outputs of two gates to provide specific logic function this type of logic is called wired logic for example open collector ttl nand gates when tied together perform wired and logic the wired and logic performed with two nand gates is depicted in fig the and gate is drawn with the lines going through the center of the gate to distinguish it from conventional gate the wired and gate is not physical gate but only symbol to designate the function obtained from the indicated wired connection the logic function implemented by the circuit of fig is ab cd ab cd and is called an andcorcinvert function a b ab cd b d c d wired and in open collector wired or in ecl gates ttl nand gates andcorcinvert orcandcinvert figure wired logic wired and logic with two nand gates wired or in emitter coupled logic ecl gates similarly the nor outputs of ecl gates can be tied together to perform wired or function the logic function implemented by the circuit of fig is and is called an orcandcinvert function wired logic gate does not produce physical second level gate since it is just wire connection nevertheless for discussion purposes we will consider the circuits of fig as two level implementations the first level consists of nand or nor gates and the second level has single and or or gate the wired connection in the graphic symbol will be omitted in subsequent discussions nondegenerate forms it will be instructive from theoretical point of view to find out how many two level combinations of gates are possible we consider four types of gates and or nand and nor if we assign one type of gate for the first level and one type for the second level we find that there are possible combinations of two level forms the same type of gate can be in the first and second levels as in nandcnand implementation eight of these combinations are said to be degenerate forms because they degenerate to single operation this can be seen from circuit with and gates in the first level and an and gate in the second level the output of the circuit is merely the and function of all input variables the remaining eight nondegenerate forms produce an implementation in sum of products form or product of sums form the eight nondegenerate forms are as follows andcor orcand nandcnand norcnor norcor nandcand orcnand andcnor section other two level implementations the first gate listed in each of the forms constitutes first level in the implementation the second gate listed is single gate placed in the second level note that any two forms listed on the same line are duals of each other the andcor and orcand forms are the basic two level forms discussed in section the nandcnand and norcnor forms were presented in section the remaining four forms are investigated in this section andcorcinvert implementation the two forms nandcand and andcnor are equivalent and can be treated together both perform the andcorcinvert function as shown in fig the andcnor form resembles the andcor form but with an inversion done by the bubble in the output of the nor gate it implements the function ab cd by using the alternative graphic symbol for the nor gate we obtain the diagram of fig note that the single variable is not complemented because the only change made is in the graphic symbol of the nor gate now we move the bubble from the input terminal of the second level gate to the output terminals of the first level gates an inverter is needed for the single variable in order to compensate for the bubble alternatively the inverter can be removed provided that input is complemented the circuit of fig is nandcand form and was shown in fig to implement the andcorcinvert function an andcor implementation requires an expression in sum of products form the andcorcinvert implementation is similar except for the inversion therefore if the complement of the function is simplified into sum of products form by combining the in the map it will be possible to implement with the andcor part of the function when passes through the always present output inversion the invert part it will a b b c f f f e e andcnor andcnor nandcand figure andcorcinvert circuits ab cd generate the output of the function an example for the andcorcinvert implementation will be shown subsequently orcandcinvert implementation the orcnand and norcor forms perform the orcandcinvert function as shown in fig the orcnand form resembles the orcand form except for the inversion done by the bubble in the nand gate it implements the function by using the alternative graphic symbol for the nand gate we obtain the diagram of fig circuit in fig is obtained by moving the small circles from the inputs of the second level gate to the outputs of the first level gates the circuit of fig is norcor form and was shown in fig to implement the orcandc invert function the orcandcinvert implementation requires an expression in product of sums form if the complement of the function is simplified into that form we can implement with the orcand part of the function when passes through the invert part we obtain the complement of or in the output tabular summary and example table summarizes the procedures for implementing boolean function in any one of the four forms because of the invert part in each case it is convenient to use the simplification of the complement of the function when is implemented in one of these forms we obtain the complement of the function in the andcor or orcand form the four forms invert this function giving an output that is the complement of this is the normal output a b b f fc d d e orcnand orcnand norcor

into of andcnor nandcand andcorcinvert sum of products form by combining orcnand norcor orcandcinvert in the map product of sums form by combining in the map and then complementing form requires an inverter for single literal term example implement the function of fig with the four forms listed in table the complement of the function is simplified into sum of products form by combining the in the map xy xy the normal output for this function can be expressed as xy xy which is in the andcorcinvert form the andcnor and nandcand implementations are shown in fig note that one input nand or inverter gate is needed in the nandcand implementation but not in the andcnor case the inverter can be removed if we apply the input variable instead of the orcandcinvert forms require simplified expression of the complement of the function in product of sums form to obtain this expression we first combine the in the map xyz xyz then we take the complement of the function chapter gate level minimization yz x xyz xyz xy xy xyz xyz map simplification in sum of products x y x f f z andcnor xy xy nandcand x y z f x y z orcnand norcor y y figure other two level implementations the normal output can now be expressed in the form which is the orcandcinvert form from this expression we can implement the function in the orcnand and norcor forms as shown in fig section exclusive or function exclusive or function the exclusive or xor denoted by the symbol is logical operation that performs the following boolean operation xy xy the exclusive or is equal to if only is equal to or if only is equal to e and differ in value but not when both are equal to or when both are equal to the exclusivenor also known as equivalence performs the following boolean operation xy xy the exclusive nor is equal to if both and are equal to or if both are equal to the exclusive nor can be shown to be the complement of the exclusive or by means of truth table or by algebraic manipulation xy xy xy xy the following identities apply to the exclusive or operation x x any of these identities can be proven with truth table or by replacing the operation by its equivalent boolean expression also it can be shown that the exclusive or operation is both commutative and associative that is b a and this means that the two inputs to an exclusive or gate can be interchanged without affecting the operation it also means that we can evaluate three variable exclusive or operation in any order and for this reason three or more variables can be expressed without parentheses this would imply the possibility of using exclusive or gates with three or more inputs however multiple input exclusive or gates are difficult to fabricate with hardware in fact even two input function is usually constructed with other types of gates two input exclusive or function is constructed with conventional gates using two inverters two and gates and an or gate as shown in fig figure shows the implementation of the exclusive or with four nand gates the first nand gate performs the operation xy the other two level nand circuit produces the sum of products of its inputs x y xy xy x xy exclusive or with andcorcnot gates xy exclusive or with nand gates figure exclusive or implementations only limited number of boolean functions can be expressed in terms of exclusive or operations nevertheless this function emerges quite often during the design of digital systems it is particularly useful in arithmetic operations and error detection and correction circuits odd function the exclusive or operation with three or more variables can be converted into an ordinary boolean function by replacing the symbol with its equivalent boolean expression in particular the three variable case can be converted to boolean expression as follows ab ab ab ab abc abc abc abc the boolean expression clearly indicates that the three variable exclusive or function is equal to if only one variable is equal to or if all three variables are equal to contrary to the two variable case in which only one variable must be equal to in the case of three or more variables the requirement is that an odd number of variables be equal to as consequence the multiple variable exclusive or operation is defined as an odd function section exclusive or function the boolean function derived from the three variable exclusive or operation is expressed as the logical sum of four minterms whose binary numerical values are and each of these binary numbers has an odd number of remaining four minterms not included in the function are and and they have an even number of in their binary numerical values in general an variable exclusive or function is an odd function defined as the logical sum of the minterms whose binary numerical values have an odd number of the definition of an odd function can be clarified by plotting it in map figure shows the map for the three variable exclusive or function the four minterms of the function are unit distance apart from each other the odd function is identified from the four minterms whose binary values have an odd number of the complement of an odd function is an even function as shown in fig the three variable even function is equal to when an even number of its variables is equal to including the condition that none of the variables is equal to the three input odd function is implemented by means of two input exclusive or gates as shown in fig complement of an odd function is obtained by replacing the output gate with an exclusive nor gate as shown in fig consider now the four variable exclusive or operation by algebraic manipulation we can obtain the sum of minterms for this function ab ab cd cd ab ab cd cd ab ab cd cd bc bc a c odd function a c even function b figure map for three variable exclusive or function a b c odd function even function figure logic diagram of odd and even functions chapter gate level minimization cd cd ab ab b a d odd function a c even function b d figure map for four variable exclusive or function there are minterms for four variable boolean function half of the minterms have binary numerical values with an odd number of the other half of the minterms have binary numerical values with an even number of in plotting the function in the map the binary numerical value for minterm is determined from the row and column numbers of the square that represents the minterm the map of fig is plot of the four variable exclusive or function this is an odd function because the binary values of all the minterms have an odd number of the complement of an odd function is an even function as shown in fig the four variable even function is equal to when an even number of its variables is equal to parity generation and checking exclusive or functions are very useful in systems requiring error detection and correction codes as discussed in section parity bit is used for the purpose of detecting errors during the transmission of binary information parity bit is an extra bit included with binary message to make the number of either odd or even the message including the parity bit is transmitted and then checked at the receiving end for errors an error is detected if the checked parity does not correspond with the one transmitted the circuit that generates the parity bit in the transmitter is called parity generator the circuit that checks the parity in the receiver is called parity checker as an example consider three bit message to be transmitted together with an even parity bit table shows the truth table for the parity generator the three bitsx and zconstitute the message and are the inputs to the circuit the parity bit is the output for even parity the bit must be generated to make the total number of including even from the truth table we see that constitutes an section exclusive or function table even parity generator truth table three bit message parity bit y p x y c z even parity generator even parity checker figure logic diagram of parity generator and checker odd function because it is equal to for those minterms whose numerical values have an odd number of therefore can be expressed as three variable exclusive or function y the logic diagram for the parity generator is shown in fig the three bits in the message together with the parity bit are transmitted to their destination where they are applied to parity checker circuit to check for possible errors in the transmission since the information was transmitted with even parity the four bits received must have an even number of an error occurs during the transmission if the four bits received have an odd number of indicating that one bit has changed in value during transmission the output of the parity checker denoted by will be equal to if an error occursthat is if the four bits received have an odd number of table is the truth table for the even parity checker from it we see that the function consists of the eight minterms with binary numerical values having an odd number of the table corresponds to the map of fig which table even parity checker truth table four bits parity error received check y p represents an odd function the parity checker can be implemented with exclusiveor gates y p the logic diagram of the parity checker is shown in fig it is worth noting that the parity generator can be implemented with the circuit of fig if the input is connected to logic and the output is marked with this is because causing the value of to pass through the gate unchanged the advantage of this strategy is that the same circuit can be used for both parity generation and checking it is obvious from the foregoing example that parity generation and checking circuits always have an output function that includes half of the minterms whose numerical values have either an odd or even number of as consequence they can be implemented with exclusive or gates function with an even number of is the complement of an odd function it is implemented with exclusive or gates except that the gate associated with the output must be an exclusive nor to provide the required complementation hardware description language manual methods for designing logic circuits are feasible only when the circuit is small for anything else e practical circuit designers use computer based design tools coupled with the correct by construction methodology computer based design tools section hardware description language leverage the creativity and the effort of designer and reduce the risk of producing flawed design prototype integrated circuits are too expensive and time consuming to build so all modern design tools rely on hardware description language to describe design and test circuit in software before it is ever manufactured hardware description language hdl is computer based language that describes the hardware of digital systems in textual form it resembles an ordinary computer programming language such as but is specifically oriented to describing hardware structures and the behavior of logic circuits it can be used to represent logic diagrams truth tables boolean expressions and complex abstractions of the behavior of digital system one way to view an hdl is to observe that it describes relationship between signals that are the inputs to circuit and the signals that are the outputs of the circuit for example an hdl description of an and gate describes how the logic value of the gates output is determined by the logic values of its inputs as documentation language an hdl is used to represent and document digital systems in form that can be read by both humans and computers and is suitable as an exchange language between designers the language content can be stored retrieved edited and transmitted easily and processed by computer software in an efficient manner hdls are used in several major steps in the design flow of an integrated circuit design entry functional simulation or verification logic synthesis timing verification and fault simulation design entry creates an hdl based description of the functionality that is to be implemented in hardware depending on the hdl the description can be in variety of forms boolean logic equations truth tables netlist of interconnected gates or an abstract behavioral model the hdl model may also represent partition of larger circuit into smaller interconnected and interacting functional units logic simulation displays the behavior of digital system through the use of computer simulator interprets the hdl description and either produces readable output such as time ordered sequence of input and output signal values or displays waveforms of the signals the simulation of circuit predicts how the hardware will behave before it is actually fabricated simulation detects functional errors in design without having to physically create and operate the circuit errors that are detected during simulation can be corrected by modifying the appropriate hdl statements the stimulus e the logic values of the inputs to circuit that tests the functionality of the design is called test bench thus to simulate digital system the design is first described in an hdl and then verified by simulating the design and checking it with test bench which is also written in the hdl an alternative and more complex approach relies on formal mathematical methods to prove that circuit is functionally correct we will focus exclusively on simulation logic synthesis is the process of deriving list of physical components and their interconnections called netlist from the model of digital system described in an hdl the netlist can be used to fabricate an integrated circuit or to lay out printed circuit board with the hardware counterparts of the gates in the list logic synthesis is similar to compiling program in conventional high level language the difference is that instead of producing an object code logic synthesis produces database describing the elements and structure of circuit the database specifies how to fabricate physical integrated circuit that implements in silicon the functionality described by statements made in an hdl logic synthesis is based on formal exact procedures that implement digital circuits and addresses that part of digital design which can be automated with computer software the design of todays large complex circuits is made possible by logic synthesis software timing verification confirms that the fabricated integrated circuit will operate at specified speed because each logic gate in circuit has propagation delay signal transition at the input of circuit cannot immediately cause change in the logic value of the output of circuit propagation delays ultimately limit the speed at which circuit can operate timing verification checks each signal path to verify that it is not compromised by propagation delay this step is done after logic synthesis specifies the actual devices that will compose circuit and before the circuit is released for production in vlsi circuit design fault simulation compares the behavior of an ideal circuit with the behavior of circuit that contains process induced flaw dust and other particulates in the atmosphere of the clean room can cause circuit to be fabricated with fault circuit with fault will not exhibit the same functionality as fault free circuit fault simulation is used to identify input stimuli that can be used to reveal the difference between the faulty circuit and the fault free circuit these test patterns will be used to test fabricated devices to ensure that only good devices are shipped to the customer test generation and fault simulation may occur at different steps in the design process but they are always done before production in order to avoid the disaster of producing circuit whose internal logic cannot be tested companies that design integrated circuits use proprietary and public hdls in the public domain there are two standard hdls that are supported by the ieee vhdl and verilog vhdl is department of defensecmandated language the in vhdl stands for the first letter in vhsic an acronym for very high speed integrated circuit verilog began as proprietary hdl of cadence design systems but cadence transferred control of verilog to consortium of companies and universities known as open verilog international ovi as step leading to its adoption as an ieee standard vhdl is more difficult to learn than verilog because verilog is an easier language than vhdl to describe learn and use we have chosen it for this book however the verilog hdl descriptions listed throughout the book are not just about verilog but also serve to introduce design methodology based on the concept of computer aided modeling of digital systems by means of typical hardware description language our emphasis will be on the modeling verification and synthesis both manual and automated of verilog models of circuits having specified behavior the verilog hdl was initially approved as standard hdl in revised and enhanced versions of the language were approved in and we will address only those features of verilog including the latest standard that support our discussion of hdl based design methodology for integrated circuits section hardware description language module declaration the language reference manual for the verilog hdl presents syntax that describes precisely the constructs that can be used in the language in particular verilog model is composed of text using keywords of which there are about keywords are predefined lowercase identifiers that define the language constructs examples of keywords are module endmodule input output wire and or and not for clarity keywords will be displayed in boldface in the text in all examples of code and wherever it is appropriate to call attention to their use any text between two forward slashes and the end of the line is interpreted as comment and will have no effect on simulation using the model multiline comments begin with and terminate with blank spaces are ignored but they may not appear within the text of keyword user specified identifier an operator or the representation of number verilog is case sensitive which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are distinguishable g not is not the same as not the term module refers to the text enclosed by the keyword pair module endmodule module is the fundamental descriptive unit in the verilog language it is declared by the keyword module and must always be terminated by the keyword endmodule combinational logic can be described by schematic connection of gates by set of boolean equations or by truth table each type of description can be developed in verilog we will demonstrate each style beginning with simple example of verilog gate level description to illustrate some aspects of the language the hdl description of the circuit of fig is shown in hdl example the first line of text is comment optional providing useful information to the reader the second line begins with the keyword module and starts the declaration description of the module the last line completes the declaration with the keyword endmodule the keyword module is followed by name and list of ports the name simple circuit in this example is an identifier identifiers are names given to modules variables g signal and other elements of the language so that they can be referenced in the design in general we choose meaningful names for modules identifiers are composed of alphanumeric characters and the underscore and are case sensitive identifiers must start with an alphabetic character or an underscore but they cannot start with number d c figure circuit to demonstrate an hdl hdl example combinational logic modeled with primitives verilog model of circuit of figure ieee syntax module simple circuit output input wire and optional gate instance name not or endmodule the port list of module is the interface between the module and its environment in this example the ports are the inputs and outputs of the circuit the logic values of the inputs to circuit are determined by the environment the logic values of the outputs are determined within the circuit and result from the action of the inputs on the circuit the port list is enclosed in parentheses and commas are used to separate elements of the list the statement is terminated with semicolon in our examples all keywords which must be in lowercase are printed in bold for clarity but that is not requirement of the language next the keywords input and output specify which of the ports are inputs and which are outputs internal connections are declared as wires the circuit in this example has one internal connection at terminal and is declared with the keyword wire the structure of the circuit is specified by list of predefined primitive gates each identified by descriptive keyword and not or the elements of the list are referred to as instantiations of gate each of which is referred to as gate instance each gate instantiation consists of an optional name such as etc followed by the gate output and inputs separated by commas and enclosed within parentheses the output of primitive gate is always listed first followed by the inputs for example the or gate of the schematic is represented by the or primitive is named and has output and inputs and note the output of primitive must be listed first but the inputs and outputs of module may be listed in any order the module description ends with the keyword endmodule each statement must be terminated with semicolon but there is no semicolon after endmodule it is important to understand the distinction between the terms declaration and instantiation verilog module is declared its declaration specifies the inputcoutput behavior of the hardware that it represents predefined primitives are not declared because their definition is specified by the language and is not subject to change by the user primitives are used e instantiated just as gates are used to populate printed circuit board well see that once module has been declared it may be used instantiated within design note that simple circuit is not computational model like those developed in an ordinary programming language the sequential ordering of the statements instantiating gates in the model has no significance and does not specify sequence of computations verilog model is descriptive model simple circuit describes what primitives form circuit and how they are connected the inputcoutput behavior of the circuit is section hardware description language table output of gates after delay time units input output ns abc d initial change implicitly specified by the description because the behavior of each logic gate is defined thus an hdl based model can be used to simulate the circuit that it represents gate delays all physical circuits exhibit propagation delay between the transition of an input and resulting transition of an output when an hdl model of circuit is simulated it is sometimes necessary to specify the amount of delay from the input to the output of its gates in verilog the propagation delay of gate is specified in terms of time units and by the symbol the numbers associated with time delays in verilog are dimensionless the association of time unit with physical time is made with the timescale compiler directive compiler directives start with the back quote or grave accent symbol such directive is specified before the declaration of module and applies to all numerical values of time in the code that follows an example of timescale directive is timescale the first number specifies the unit of measurement for time delays the second number specifies the precision for which the delays are rounded off in this case to ns if no timescale is specified simulator may display dimensionless values or default to certain time unit usually ns our examples will use only the default time unit hdl example repeats the description of the simple circuit of example but with propagation delays specified for each gate the and or and not gates have time delay of and ns respectively if the circuit is simulated and the inputs change from to the outputs change as shown in table calculated by hand or generated by simulator the output of the inverter at changes from to after delay the output of the and gate at changes from to after delay the output of the or gate at changes from to at ns and then changes back to at ns in both cases the change in the output of the or gate results from change in its inputs ns earlier it is clear from this result that although output eventually returns to final value of after the input changes the gate delays produce negative spike that lasts ns before the final value is reached hdl example gate level model with propagation delays verilog model of simple circuit with propagation delay module simple circuit prop delay output input wire and not or endmodule in order to simulate circuit with an hdl it is necessary to apply inputs to the circuit so that the simulator will generate an output response an hdl description that provides the stimulus to design is called test bench the writing of test benches is explained in more detail at the end of section here we demonstrate the procedure with simple example without dwelling on too many details hdl example shows test bench for simulating the circuit with delay note the distinguishing name simple circuit prop delay in its simplest form test bench is module containing signal generator and an instantiation of the model that is to be verified note that the test bench simple circuit prop delay has no input or output ports because it does not interact with its environment in general we prefer to name the test bench with the prefix concatenated with the name of the module that is to be tested by the test bench but that choice is left to the designer within the test bench the inputs to the circuit are declared with keyword reg and the outputs are declared with the keyword wire the module simple circuit prop delay is instantiated with the instance name every instantiation of module must include unique instance name note that using test bench is similar to testing actual hardware by attaching signal generators to the inputs of circuit and attaching hdl example test bench test bench for simple circuit prop delay module simple circuit prop delay wire reg simple circuit prop delay instance name required initial begin end initial finish endmodule section hardware description language name ns ns ns ns b d figure simulation output of hdl example probes wires to the outputs of the circuit the interaction between the signal generators of the stimulus module and the instantiated circuit module is illustrated in fig hardware signal generators are not used to verify an hdl model the entire simulation exercise is done with software models executing on digital computer under the direction of an hdl simulator the waveforms of the input signals are abstractly modeled generated by verilog statements specifying waveform values and transitions the initial keyword is used with set of statements that begin executing when the simulation is initialized the signal activity associated with initial terminates execution when the last statement has finished executing the initial statements are commonly used to describe waveforms in test bench the set of statements to be executed is called block statement and consists of several statements enclosed by the keywords begin and end the action specified by the statements begins when the simulation is launched and the statements are executed in sequence left to right from top to bottom by simulator in order to provide the input to the circuit initially and are each set to which signifies one binary digit with value of after ns the inputs change to after another ns the simulation terminates at time ns second initial statement uses the finish system task to specify termination of the simulation if statement is preceded by delay value g the simulator postpones executing the statement until the specified time delay has elapsed the timing diagram of waveforms that result from the simulation is shown in figure the total simulation generates waveforms over an interval of ns the inputs and change from to after ns output is unknown for the first ns denoted by shading and output is unknown for the first ns output goes from to at ns output goes from to at ns and back to at ns just as we predicted in table boolean expressions boolean equations describing combinational logic are specified in verilog with continuous assignment statement consisting of the keyword assign followed by boolean expression to distinguish arithmetic operators from logical operators verilog uses the symbols and for and or and not complement respectively thus to describe the simple circuit of fig with boolean expression we use the statement assign hdl example describes circuit that is specified with the following two boolean expressions bc bd bc bcd the equations specify how the logic values and are determined by the values of and hdl example combinational logic modeled with boolean equations verilog model circuit with boolean expressions module circuit boolean ca output input assign a assign endmodule the circuit has two outputs and and four inputs and the two assign statements describe the boolean equations the values of and during simulation are determined dynamically by the values of and the simulator detects when the test bench changes value of one or more of the inputs when this happens the simulator updates the values of and the continuous assignment mechanism is so named because the relationship between the assigned value and the variables is permanent the mechanism acts just like combinational logic has gate level equivalent circuit and is referred to as implicit combinational logic we have shown that digital circuit can be described with hdl statements just as it can be drawn in circuit diagram or specified with boolean expression third alternative is to describe combinational logic with truth table user defined primitives the logic gates used in verilog descriptions with keywords and or etc are defined by the system and are referred to as system primitives caution other languages may use these words differently the user can create additional primitives by defining them in tabular form these types of circuits are referred to as user defined primitives udps one way of specifying digital circuit in tabular form is by means of truth table udp descriptions do not use the keyword pair module endmodule instead they are declared with the keyword pair primitive endprimitive the best way to demonstrate udp declaration is by means of an example section hardware description language hdl example defines udp with truth table it proceeds according to the following general rules it is declared with the keyword primitive followed by name and port list there can be only one output and it must be listed rst in the port list and declared with keyword output there can be any number of inputs the order in which they are listed in the input declaration must conform to the order in which they are given values in the table that follows the truth table is enclosed within the keywords table and endtable the values of the inputs are listed in order ending with colon the output is always the last entry in row and is followed by semicolon the declaration of udp ends with the keyword endprimitive hdl example user defined primitive verilog model user defined primitive primitive output input truth table for f table b column header comment endtable endprimitive instantiate primitive verilog model circuit instantiation of module output input option gate instance name omitted and endmodule b c f figure schematic for circuit note that the variables listed on top of the table are part of comment and are shown only for clarity the system recognizes the variables by the order in which they are listed in the input declaration user defined primitive can be instantiated in the construction of other modules digital circuits just as the system primitives are used for example the declaration circuit with udp will produce circuit that implements the hardware shown in figure although verilog hdl uses this kind of description for udps only other hdls and computer aided design cad systems use other procedures to specify digital circuits in tabular form the tables can be processed by cad software to derive an efficient gate structure of the design none of verilogs predefined primitives describes sequential logic the model of sequential udp requires that its output be declared as reg data type and that column be added to the truth table to describe the next state so the columns are organized as inputs state next state in this section we introduced the verilog hdl and presented simple examples to illustrate alternatives for modeling combinational logic more detailed

systems may be combinational or sequential combinational circuit consists of logic gates whose outputs at any time are determined from only the present combination of inputs combinational circuit performs an operation that can be specified logically by set of boolean functions in contrast sequential circuits employ storage elements in addition to logic gates their outputs are function of the inputs and the state of the storage elements because the state of the storage elements is function of previous inputs the outputs of sequential circuit depend not only on present values of inputs but also on past inputs and the circuit behavior must be specified by time sequence of inputs and internal states sequential circuits are the building blocks of digital systems and are discussed in chapters and combinational circuits combinational circuit consists of an interconnection of logic gates combinational logic gates react to the values of the signals at their inputs and produce the value of the output signal transforming binary information from the given input data to required output data block diagram of combinational circuit is shown in fig the input binary variables come from an external source the output variables are produced by the internal combinational logic circuit and go to an external destination each input and output variable exists physically as an analog signal whose values are interpreted to be binary signal that represents logic and logic note logic simulators show only and not the actual analog signals in many applications the source and inputs combinational outputs circuit figure block diagram of combinational circuit destination are storage registers if the registers are included with the combinational gates then the total circuit must be considered to be sequential circuit for input variables there are possible combinations of the binary inputs for each possible input combination there is one possible value for each output variable thus combinational circuit can be specified with truth table that lists the output values for each combination of input variables combinational circuit also can be described by boolean functions one for each output variable each output function is expressed in terms of the input variables in chapter we learned about binary numbers and binary codes that represent discrete quantities of information the binary variables are represented physically by electric voltages or some other type of signal the signals can be manipulated in digital logic gates to perform required functions in chapter we introduced boolean algebra as way to express logic functions algebraically in chapter we learned how to simplify boolean functions to achieve economical simpler gate implementations the purpose of the current chapter is to use the knowledge acquired in previous chapters to formulate systematic analysis and design procedures for combinational circuits the solution of some typical examples will provide useful catalog of elementary functions that are important for the understanding of digital systems well address three tasks analyze the behavior of given logic circuit synthesize circuit that will have given behavior and write hardware description language hdl models for some common circuits there are several combinational circuits that are employed extensively in the design of digital systems these circuits are available in integrated circuits and are classified as standard components they perform specific digital functions commonly needed in the design of digital systems in this chapter we introduce the most important standard combinational circuits such as adders subtractors comparators decoders encoders and multiplexers these components are available in integrated circuits as medium scale integration msi circuits they are also used as standard cells in complex very largescale integrated vlsi circuits such as application specific integrated circuits asics the standard cell functions are interconnected within the vlsi circuit in the same way that they are used in multiple ic msi design analysis procedure the analysis of combinational circuit requires that we determine the function that the circuit implements this task starts with given logic diagram and culminates with set of boolean functions truth table or possibly an explanation of the circuit operation section analysis procedure if the logic diagram to be analyzed is accompanied by function name or an explanation of what it is assumed to accomplish then the analysis problem reduces to verification of the stated function the analysis can be performed manually by finding the boolean functions or truth table or by using computer simulation program the first step in the analysis is to make sure that the given circuit is combinational and not sequential the diagram of combinational circuit has logic gates with no feedback paths or memory elements feedback path is connection from the output of one gate to the input of second gate whose output forms part of the input to the first gate feedback paths in digital circuit define sequential circuit and must be analyzed by special methods and will not be considered here once the logic diagram is verified to be that of combinational circuit one can proceed to obtain the output boolean functions or the truth table if the function of the circuit is under investigation then it is necessary to interpret the operation of the circuit from the derived boolean functions or truth table the success of such an investigation is enhanced if one has previous experience and familiarity with wide variety of digital circuits to obtain the output boolean functions from logic diagram we proceed as follows label all gate outputs that are function of input variables with arbitrary symbols but with meaningful names determine the boolean functions for each gate output label the gates that are function of input variables and previously labeled gates with other arbitrary symbols find the boolean functions for these gates repeat the process outlined in step until the outputs of the circuit are obtained by repeated substitution of previously defined functions obtain the output boolean functions in terms of input variables the analysis of the combinational circuit of fig illustrates the proposed procedure we note that the circuit has three binary inputsa and cand two binary and the outputs of various gates are labeled with intermediate symbols the outputs of gates that are function only of input variables are and output can easily be derived from the input variables the boolean functions for these three outputs are ab ac bc abc next we consider outputs of gates that are function of already defined symbols to obtain as function of and we form series of substitutions as follows abc ac abc abc ac bc abc abc abc abc abc b a c b c c figure logic diagram for analysis example if we want to pursue the investigation and determine the information transformation task achieved by this circuit we can draw the circuit from the derived boolean expressions and try to recognize familiar operation the boolean functions for and implement circuit discussed in section merely finding boolean representation of circuit doesnt provide insight into its behavior but in this example we will observe that the boolean equations and truth table for and match those describing the functionality of what we call full adder the derivation of the truth table for circuit is straightforward process once the output boolean functions are known to obtain the truth table directly from the logic diagram without going through the derivations of the boolean functions we proceed as follows determine the number of input variables in the circuit for inputs form the possible input combinations and list the binary numbers from to in table label the outputs of selected gates with arbitrary symbols obtain the truth table for the outputs of those gates which are function of the input variables only proceed to obtain the truth table for the outputs of those gates which are function of previously defined values until the columns for all outputs are determined section design procedure table truth table for the logic diagram of fig b this process is illustrated with the circuit of fig in table we form the eight possible combinations for the three input variables the truth table for is determined directly from the values of and with equal to for any combination that has two or three inputs equal to the truth table for is the complement of the truth tables for and are the or and and functions of the input variables respectively the values for are derived from and is equal to when both and are equal to and is equal to otherwise finally is equal to for those combinations in which either or or both are equal to inspection of the truth table combinations for and shows that it is identical to the truth table of the full adder given in section for and respectively another way of analyzing combinational circuit is by means of logic simulation this is not practical however because the number of input patterns that might be needed to generate meaningful outputs could be very large but simulation has very practical application in verifying that the functionality of circuit actually matches its specification in section we demonstrate the logic simulation and verification of the circuit of fig using verilog hdl design procedure the design of combinational circuits starts from the specification of the design objective and culminates in logic circuit diagram or set of boolean functions from which the logic diagram can be obtained the procedure involves the following steps from the specifications of the circuit determine the required number of inputs and outputs and assign symbol to each derive the truth table that defines the required relationship between inputs and outputs obtain the simplified boolean functions for each output as function of the input variables draw the logic diagram and verify the correctness of the design manually or by simulation truth table for combinational circuit consists of input columns and output columns the input columns are obtained from the binary numbers for the input variables the binary values for the outputs are determined from the stated specifications the output functions specified in the truth table give the exact definition of the combinational circuit it is important that the verbal specifications be interpreted correctly in the truth table as they are often incomplete and any wrong interpretation may result in an incorrect truth table the output binary functions listed in the truth table are simplified by any available method such as algebraic manipulation the map method or computer based simplification program frequently there is variety of simplified expressions from which to choose in particular application certain criteria will serve as guide in the process of choosing an implementation practical design must consider such constraints as the number of gates number of inputs to gate propagation time of the signal through the gates number of interconnections limitations of the driving capability of each gate e the number of gates to which the output of the circuit may be connected and various other criteria that must be taken into consideration when designing integrated circuits since the importance of each constraint is dictated by the particular application it is difficult to make general statement about what constitutes an acceptable implementation in most cases the simplification begins by satisfying an elementary objective such as producing the simplified boolean functions in standard form then the simplification proceeds with further steps to meet other performance criteria code conversion example the availability of large variety of codes for the same discrete elements of information results in the use of different codes by different digital systems it is sometimes necessary to use the output of one system as the input to another conversion circuit must be inserted between the two systems if each uses different codes for the same information thus code converter is circuit that makes the two systems compatible even though each uses different binary code to convert from binary code to binary code the input lines must supply the bit combination of elements as specified by code and the output lines must generate the corresponding bit combination of code combinational circuit performs this transformation by means of logic gates the design procedure will be illustrated by an example that converts binary coded decimal bcd to the code for the decimal digits the bit combinations assigned to the bcd and codes are listed in table section since each code uses four bits to represent decimal digit there must section design procedure table truth table for code conversion example input bcd output code b cd wx z be four input variables and four output variables we designate the four input binary variables by the symbols and and the four output variables by and the truth table relating the input and output variables is shown in table the bit combinations for the inputs and their corresponding outputs are obtained directly from section note that four binary variables may have bit combinations but only are listed in the truth table the six bit combinations not listed for the input variables are dont care combinations these values have no meaning in bcd and we assume that they will never occur in actual operation of the circuit therefore we are at liberty to assign to the output variables either or whichever gives simpler circuit the maps in fig are plotted to obtain simplified boolean functions for the outputs each one of the four maps represents one of the four outputs of the circuit as function of the four input variables the marked inside the squares are obtained from the minterms that make the output equal to the are obtained from the truth table by going over the output columns one at time for example the column under output has five therefore the map for has five each being in square corresponding to the minterm that makes equal to the six dont care minterms through are marked with an one possible way to simplify the functions into sum of products form is listed under the map of each variable see chapter two level logic diagram for each output may be obtained directly from the boolean expressions derived from the maps there are various other possibilities for logic diagram that implements this circuit the expressions obtained in fig may be manipulated algebraically for the purpose of using common gates for two or more outputs this manipulation shown next illustrates the flexibility obtained with multiple output systems when cd cd ab ab b x x x x a x x d d cd cd c cd cd ab ab b x x x x m x x d x bc bd

diagram for code converter implementation will require inverters for variables and and the second implementation will require inverters for variables and thus the three level logic circuit requires fewer gates all of which in turn require no more than two inputs binary addercsubtractor digital computers perform variety of information processing tasks among the functions encountered are the various arithmetic operations the most basic arithmetic operation is the addition of two binary digits this simple addition consists of four possible elementary operations and the first three operations produce sum of one digit but when both augend and addend bits are equal to the binary sum consists of two digits the higher significant bit of this result is called carry when the augend and addend numbers contain more significant digits the carry obtained from the addition of two bits is added to the next higher order pair of significant bits combinational circuit that performs the addition of two bits is called half adder one that performs the addition of three bits two significant bits and previous carry is full adder the names of the circuits stem from the fact that two half adders can be employed to implement full adder binary addercsubtractor is combinational circuit that performs the arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction with binary numbers we will develop this circuit by means of hierarchical design the half adder design is carried out first from which we develop the full adder connecting full adders in cascade produces binary adder for two bit numbers the subtraction circuit is included in complementing circuit half adder from the verbal explanation of half adder we find that this circuit needs two binary inputs and two binary outputs the input variables designate the augend and addend bits the output variables produce the sum and carry we assign symbols and to the two inputs and for sum and for carry to the outputs the truth table for the half adder is listed in table the output is only when both inputs are the output represents the least significant bit of the sum the simplified boolean functions for the two outputs can be obtained directly from the truth table the simplified sum of products expressions are xy xy xy the logic diagram of the half adder implemented in sum of products is shown in fig it can be also implemented with an exclusive or and an and gate as shown in fig this form is used to show that two half adders can be used to construct full adder table half adder y s s x x y c y x xy xy xy xy figure implementation of half adder section binary addercsubtractor full adder addition of bit binary numbers requires the use of full adder and the process of addition proceeds on bit by bit basis right to left beginning with the least significant bit after the least significant bit addition at each position adds not only the respective bits of the words but must also consider possible carry bit from addition at the previous position full adder is combinational circuit that forms the arithmetic sum of three bits it consists of three inputs and two outputs two of the input variables denoted by and represent the two significant bits to be added the third input represents the carry from the previous lower significant position two outputs are necessary because the arithmetic sum of three binary digits ranges in value from to and binary representation of or needs two bits the two outputs are designated by the symbols for sum and for carry the binary variable gives the value of the least significant bit of the sum the binary variable gives the output carry formed by adding the input carry and the bits of the words the truth table of the full adder is listed in table eight rows under the input variables designate all possible combinations of the three variables the output variables are determined from the arithmetic sum of the input bits when all input bits are the output is the output is equal to when only one input is equal to or when all three inputs are equal to the output has carry of if two or three inputs are equal to the input and output bits of the combinational circuit have different interpretations at various stages of the problem on the one hand physically the binary signals of the inputs are considered binary digits to be added arithmetically to form two digit sum at the output on the other hand the same binary values are considered as variables of boolean functions when expressed in the truth table or when the circuit is implemented with logic gates the maps for the outputs of the full adder are shown in fig the simplified expressions are xyz xyz xyz xyz xy xz yz the logic diagram for the full adder implemented in sum of products form is shown in fig it can also be

implementation of full adder in sum of products form in fig the output from the second half adder is the exclusive or of and the output of the first half adder giving xyz xyz xyz xyz the carry output

from each full adder connected to the input carry of the next full adder in the chain section binary addercsubtractor xy y y y xy y xy z figure implementation of full adder with two half adders and an or gate addition of bit numbers requires chain of full adders or chain of one half adder and full adders in the former case the input carry to the least significant position is fixed at figure shows the interconnection of four full adder fa circuits to provide four bit binary ripple carry adder the augend bits of and the addend bits of are designated by subscript numbers from right to left with subscript denoting the least significant bit the carries are connected in chain through the full adders the input carry to the adder is and it ripples through the full adders to the output carry the outputs generate the required sum bits an bit adder requires full adders with each output carry connected to the input carry of the next higher order full adder to demonstrate with specific example consider the two binary numbers and their sum is formed with the four bit adder as follows subscript input carry ci augend addend ai sum bi output carry si ci the bits are added with full adders starting from the least significant position subscript to form the sum bit and carry bit the input carry in the least significant position must be the value of in given significant position is the output carry of the full adder this value is transferred into the input carry of the full adder that adds the bits one higher significant position to the left the sum bits are thus generated starting from the rightmost position and are available as soon as the corresponding previous carry bit is generated all the carries must be generated for the correct sum bits to appear at the outputs the four bit adder is typical example of standard component it can be used in many applications involving arithmetic operations observe that the design of this circuit fa fa fa fa figure four bit adder by the classical method would require truth table with entries since there are nine inputs to the circuit by using an iterative method of cascading standard function it is possible to obtain simple and straightforward implementation carry propagation the addition of two binary numbers in parallel implies that all the bits of the augend and addend are available for computation at the same time as in any combinational circuit the signal must propagate through the gates before the correct output sum is available in the output terminals the total propagation time is equal to the propagation delay of typical gate times the number of gate levels in the circuit the longest propagation delay time in an adder is the time it takes the carry to propagate through the full adders since each bit of the sum output depends on the value of the input carry the value of si at any given stage in the adder will be in its steady state final value only after the input carry to that stage has been propagated in this regard consider output in fig inputs and are available as soon as input signals are applied to the adder however input carry does not settle to its final value until is available from the previous stage similarly has to wait for and so on down to thus only after the carry propagates and ripples through all stages will the last output and carry settle to their final correct value the number of gate levels for the carry propagation can be found from the circuit of the full adder the circuit is redrawn with different labels in fig for convenience the input and output variables use the subscript to denote typical stage of the adder the signals at pi and gi settle to their steady state values after they propagate through their respective gates these two signals are common to all half adders and depend on only the input augend and addend bits the signal from the input carry ci to the output carry ci propagates through an and gate and an or gate which constitute two gate levels if there are four full adders in the adder the output carry would have gate levels from to for an bit adder there are gate levels for the carry to propagate from input to output section binary addercsubtractor half adder half adder pi ci ai pi bi si pici gi ci gi ci figure full adder with and shown the carry propagation time is an important attribute of the adder because it limits the speed with which two numbers are added although the adderor for that matter any combinational circuitwill always have some value at its output terminals the outputs will not be correct unless the signals are given enough time to propagate through the gates connected from the inputs to the outputs since all other arithmetic operations are implemented by successive additions the time consumed during the addition process is critical an obvious solution for reducing the carry propagation delay time is to employ faster gates with reduced delays however physical circuits have limit to their capability another solution is to increase the complexity of the equipment in such way that the carry delay time is reduced there are several techniques for reducing the carry propagation time in parallel adder the most widely used technique employs the principle of carry lookahead logic consider the circuit of the full adder shown in fig if we define two new binary variables pi ai bi gi aibi the output sum and carry can respectively be expressed as si pi ci ci gi pici gi is called carry generate and it produces carry of when both ai and bi are regardless of the input carry ci pi is called carry propagate because it determines whether carry into stage will propagate into stage e whether an assertion of ci will propagate to an assertion of we now write the boolean functions for the carry outputs of each stage and substitute the value of each ci from the previous equations input carry since the boolean function for each output carry is expressed in sum of products form each function can be implemented with one level of and gates followed by an or gate or by two level nand the three boolean functions for and are implemented in the carry lookahead generator shown in fig note that this circuit can add in less time because does not have to wait for and to propagate in fact is propagated at the same time as and this gain in speed of operation is achieved at the expense of additional complexity hardware the construction of four bit adder with carry lookahead scheme is shown in fig each sum output requires two exclusive or gates the output of the first exclusive or gate generates the pi variable and the and gate generates the gi variable the carries are propagated through the carry lookahead generator similar to that in fig and applied as inputs to the second exclusive or gate all output carries are generated after figure logic diagram of carry lookahead generator section binary addercsubtractor carry lookahead generator figure four bit adder with carry lookahead delay through two levels of gates thus outputs through have equal propagation delay times the two level circuit for the output carry is not shown this circuit can easily be derived by the equation substitution method binary subtractor the subtraction of unsigned binary numbers can be done most conveniently by means of complements as discussed in section remember that the subtraction b can be done by taking the complement of and adding it to the complement can be obtained by taking the complement and adding to the least significant pair of bits the complement can be implemented with inverters and can be added to the sum through the input carry c fa fa fa fa figure four bit addercsubtractor with overflow detection the circuit for subtracting b consists of an adder with inverters placed between each data input and the corresponding input of the full adder the input carry must be equal to when subtraction is performed the operation thus performed becomes plus the complement of plus this is equal to plus the complement of for unsigned numbers that gives b if b or the complement of if b for signed numbers the result is b provided that there is no overflow see section the addition and subtraction operations can be combined into one circuit with one common binary adder by including an exclusive or gate with each full adder four bit addercsubtractor circuit is shown in fig the mode input controls the operation when the circuit is an adder and when the circuit becomes subtractor each exclusive or gate receives input and one of the inputs of when we have the full adders receive the value of the input carry is and the circuit performs plus when we have and the inputs are all complemented and is added through the input carry the circuit performs the operation plus the complement of the exclusive or with output is for detecting an overflow it is worth noting that binary numbers in the signed complement system are added and subtracted by the same basic addition and subtraction rules as are unsigned numbers therefore computers need only one common hardware circuit to handle both types of arithmetic the user or programmer must interpret the results of such addition or subtraction differently depending on whether it is assumed that the numbers are signed or unsigned section binary addercsubtractor overflow when two numbers with digits each are added and the sum is number occupying digits we say that an overflow occurred this is true for binary or decimal numbers signed or unsigned when the addition is performed with paper and pencil an overflow is not problem since there is no limit by the width of the page to write down the sum overflow is problem in digital computers because the number of bits that hold the number is finite and result that contains bits cannot be accommodated by an bit word for this reason many computers detect the occurrence of an overflow and when it occurs corresponding flip flop is set that can then be checked by the user the detection of an overflow after the addition of two binary numbers depends on whether the numbers are considered to be signed or unsigned when two unsigned numbers are added an overflow is detected from the end carry out of the most significant position in the case of signed numbers two details are important the leftmost bit always represents the sign and negative numbers are in form when two signed numbers are added the sign bit is treated as part of the number and the end carry does not indicate an overflow an overflow cannot occur after an addition if one number is positive and the other is negative since adding positive number to negative number produces result whose magnitude is smaller than the larger of the two original numbers an overflow may occur if the two numbers added are both positive or both negative to see how this can happen consider the following example two signed binary numbers and are stored in two eight bit registers the range of numbers that each register can accommodate is from binary to binary since the sum of the two numbers is it exceeds the capacity of an eight bit register this is also true for and the two additions in binary are shown next together with the last two carries carries carries note that the eight bit result that should have been positive has negative sign bit e the eighth bit and the eight bit result that should have been negative has positive sign bit if however the carry out of the sign bit position is taken as the sign bit of the result then the nine bit answer so obtained will be correct but since the answer cannot be accommodated within eight bits we say that an overflow has occurred an overflow condition can be detected by observing the carry into the sign bit position and the carry out of the sign bit position if these two carries are not equal an overflow has occurred this is indicated in the examples in which the two carries are explicitly shown if the two carries are applied to an exclusive or gate an overflow is detected when the output of the gate is equal to for this method to work correctly the complement of negative number must be computed by taking the complement and adding this takes care of the condition when the maximum negative number is complemented the binary addercsubtractor circuit with outputs and is shown in fig if the two binary numbers are considered to be unsigned then the bit detects carry after addition or borrow after subtraction if the numbers are considered to be signed then the bit detects an overflow if after an addition or subtraction then no overflow occurred and the bit result is correct if then the result of the operation contains bits but only the rightmost bits of the number fit in the space available so an overflow has occurred the th bit is the actual sign and has been shifted out of position decimal adder computers or calculators that perform arithmetic operations directly in the decimal number system represent decimal numbers in binary coded form an adder for such computer must employ arithmetic circuits that accept coded decimal numbers and present results in the same code for binary addition it is sufficient to consider pair of significant bits together with previous carry decimal adder requires minimum of nine inputs and five outputs since four bits are required to code each decimal digit and the circuit must have an input and output carry there is wide variety of possible decimal adder circuits depending upon the code used to represent the decimal digits here we examine decimal adder for the bcd code see section bcd adder consider the arithmetic addition of two decimal digits in bcd together with an input carry from previous stage since each input digit does not exceed the output sum cannot be greater than the in the sum being an input carry suppose we apply two bcd digits to four bit binary adder the adder will form the sum in binary and produce result that ranges from through these binary numbers are listed in table and are labeled by symbols and is the carry and the subscripts under the letter represent the weights and that can be assigned to the four bits in the bcd code the columns under the binary sum list the binary value that appears in the outputs of the four bit binary adder the output sum of two decimal digits must be represented in bcd and should appear in the form listed in the columns under bcd sum the problem is to find rule by which the binary sum is converted to the correct bcd digit representation of the number in the bcd sum in examining the contents of the table it becomes apparent that when the binary sum is equal to or less than the corresponding bcd number is identical and therefore no conversion is needed when the binary sum is greater than we obtain an invalid bcd representation the addition of binary to the binary sum converts it to the correct bcd representation and also produces an output carry as required section decimal adder table bcd sum decimal derivation of bcd adder binary sum the logic circuit that detects the necessary correction can be derived from the entries in the table it is obvious that correction is needed when the binary sum has an output carry the other six combinations from through that need correction have in position to distinguish them from binary and which also have in position we specify further that either or must have the condition for correction and an output carry can be expressed by the boolean function when it is necessary to add to the binary sum and provide an output carry for the next stage bcd adder that adds two bcd digits and produces sum digit in bcd is shown in fig the two decimal digits together with the input carry are first added in the top four bit adder to produce the binary sum when the output carry is equal to nothing is added to the binary sum when it is equal to binary is added to the binary sum through the bottom four bit adder the output carry generated from the bottom addend carry binary adder carry in out output carry binary adder figure block diagram of bcd adder adder can be ignored since it supplies information already available at the output carry terminal decimal parallel adder that adds decimal digits needs bcd adder stages the output carry from one stage must be connected to the input carry of the next higher order stage binary multiplier multiplication of binary numbers is performed in the same way as multiplication of decimal numbers the multiplicand is multiplied by each bit of the multiplier starting from the least significant bit each such multiplication forms partial product successive partial products are shifted one position to the left the final product is obtained from the sum of the partial products to see how binary multiplier can be implemented with combinational circuit consider the multiplication of two numbers as shown in fig the multiplicand section binary multiplier ha ha figure two bit by two bit binary multiplier bits are and the multiplier bits are and and the product is the first partial product is formed by multiplying by the multiplication of two bits such as and produces if both bits are otherwise it produces this is identical to an and operation therefore the partial product can be implemented with and gates as shown in the diagram the second partial product is formed by multiplying by and shifting one position to the left the two partial products are added with two half adder ha circuits usually there are more bits in the partial products and it is necessary to use full adders to produce the sum of the partial products note that the least significant bit of the product does not have to go through an adder since it is formed by the output of the first and gate combinational circuit binary multiplier with more bits can be constructed in similar fashion bit of the multiplier is anded with each bit of the multiplicand in as many levels as there are bits in the multiplier the binary output in each level of and gates is added with the partial product of the previous level to form new partial product the last level produces the product for multiplier bits and multiplicand bits we need and gates and bit adders to produce product of bits as second example consider multiplier circuit that multiplies binary number represented by four bits by number represented by three bits let the multiplicand be represented by and the multiplier by since and we need and gates and two adders to produce product of seven bits the logic diagram of the multiplier is shown in fig addend augend adder sum and output carry addend augend adder sum and output carry figure four bit by three bit binary multiplier magnitude comparator the comparison of two numbers is an operation that determines whether one number is greater than less than or equal to the other number magnitude comparator is combinational circuit that compares two numbers and and determines their relative magnitudes the outcome of the comparison is specified by three binary variables that indicate whether b or b on the one hand the circuit for comparing two bit numbers has entries in the truth table and becomes too cumbersome even with on the other hand as one section magnitude comparator may suspect comparator circuit possesses certain amount of regularity digital functions that possess an inherent well defined regularity can usually be designed by means of an algorithma procedure which specifies finite set of steps that if followed give the solution to problem we illustrate this method here by deriving an algorithm for the design of four bit magnitude comparator the algorithm is direct application of the procedure person uses to compare the relative magnitudes of two numbers consider two numbers and with four digits each write the coefficients of the numbers in descending order of significance each subscripted letter represents one of the digits in the number the two numbers are equal if all pairs of significant digits are equal and when the numbers are binary the digits are either or and the equality of each pair of bits can be expressed logically with an exclusive nor function as xi aibi ai bi for where xi only if the pair of bits in position are equal e if both are or both are the equality of the two numbers and is displayed in combinational circuit by an output binary variable that we designate by the symbol this binary variable is equal to if the input numbers and are equal and is equal to otherwise for equality to exist all xi variables must be equal to condition that dictates an and operation of all variables the binary variable is equal to only if all pairs of digits of the two numbers are equal to determine whether is greater or less than we inspect the relative magnitudes of pairs of significant digits starting from the most significant position if the two digits of pair are equal we compare the next lower significant pair of digits the comparison continues until pair of unequal digits is reached if the corresponding digit of is and that of is we conclude that b if the corresponding digit of is and that of is we have b the sequential comparison can be expressed logically by the two boolean functions the symbols and are binary output variables that are equal to when b and b respectively the gate implementation of the three output variables just derived is simpler than it seems because it involves certain amount of repetition the unequal outputs can use the same gates that are needed to generate the equal output the logic diagram of the four bit magnitude comparator is shown in fig the four outputs are generated b b b figure four bit magnitude comparator with exclusive nor circuits and are applied to an and gate to give the output binary variable the other two outputs use the variables to generate the boolean functions listed previously this is multilevel implementation and has regular pattern the procedure for obtaining magnitude comparator circuits for binary numbers with more than four bits is obvious from this example decoders discrete quantities of information are represented in digital systems by binary codes binary code of bits is capable of representing up to distinct elements of coded information decoder is combinational circuit that converts binary information from section decoders input lines to maximum of unique output lines if the bit coded information has unused combinations the decoder may have fewer than outputs the decoders presented here are called to line decoders where their purpose is to generate the or fewer minterms of input variables each combination of inputs will assert unique output the name decoder is also used in conjunction with other code converters such as bcd to seven segment decoder as an example consider the three to eight line decoder circuit of fig the three inputs are decoded into eight outputs each representing one of the minterms of the three input variables the three inverters provide the complement of the inputs and each one of the eight and gates generates one of the minterms particular application of this decoder is binary to octal conversion the input variables represent binary number and the outputs represent the eight digits of number in the octal number system however three to eight line decoder can be used for decoding any three bit code to provide eight outputs one for each element of the code xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz figure three to eight line decoder table truth table of three to eight line decoder inputs outputs y d d d d the operation of the decoder may be clarified by the truth table listed in table for each possible input combination there are seven outputs that are equal to and only one that is equal to the output whose value is equal to represents the minterm equivalent of the binary number currently available in the input lines some decoders are constructed with nand gates since nand gate produces the and operation with an inverted output it becomes more economical to generate the decoder minterms in their complemented form furthermore decoders include one or more enable inputs to control the circuit operation two to four line decoder with an enable input constructed with nand gates is shown in fig the circuit operates with complemented outputs and complement enable input the decoder is enabled when is equal to e active low enable as indicated by the truth table only one eab xx b truth table logic diagram figure two to four line decoder with enable input section decoders output can be equal to at any given time all other outputs are equal to the output whose value is equal to represents the minterm selected by inputs and the circuit is disabled when is equal to regardless of the values of the other two inputs when the circuit is disabled none of the outputs are equal to and none of the minterms are selected in general decoder may operate with complemented or uncomplemented outputs the enable input may be activated with or with signal some decoders have two or more enable inputs that must satisfy given logic condition in order to enable the circuit decoder with enable input can function as demultiplexera circuit that receives information from single line and directs it to one of possible output lines the selection of specific output is controlled by the bit combination of selection lines the decoder of fig can function as one to four line demultiplexer when is taken as data input line and and are taken as the selection inputs the single input variable has path to all four outputs but the input information is directed to only one of the output lines as specified by the binary combination of the two selection lines and this feature can be verified from the truth table of the circuit for example if the selection lines ab output will be the same as the input value while all other outputs are maintained at because decoder and demultiplexer operations are obtained from the same circuit decoder with an enable input is referred to as decodercdemultiplexer decoders with enable inputs can be connected together to form larger decoder circuit figure shows two decoders with enable inputs connected to form decoder when the top decoder is enabled and the other is disabled the bottom decoder outputs are all and the top eight outputs generate minterms to when the enable conditions are reversed the bottom decoder outputs generate minterms to while the outputs of the top decoder are all this example demonstrates the usefulness of enable inputs in decoders and other y to decoder e to decoder figure decoder constructed with two decoders combinational logic components in general enable inputs are convenient feature for interconnecting two or more standard components for the purpose of combining them into similar function with more inputs and outputs combinational logic implementation decoder provides the minterms of input variables each asserted output of the decoder is associated with unique pattern of input bits since any boolean function can be expressed in sum of minterms form decoder that generates the minterms of the function together with an external or gate that forms their logical sum provides hardware implementation of the function in this way any combinational circuit with inputs and outputs can be implemented with an decoder and or gates the procedure for implementing combinational circuit by means of decoder and or gates requires that the boolean function for the circuit be expressed as sum of minterms decoder is then chosen that generates all the minterms of the input variables the inputs to each or gate are selected from the decoder outputs according to the list of minterms of each function this procedure will be illustrated by an example that implements full adder circuit from the truth table of the full adder see table we obtain the functions for the combinational circuit in sum of minterms form x since there are three inputs and total of eight minterms we need three to eight line decoder the implementation is shown in fig the decoder generates the eight minterms for and the or gate for output forms the logical sum of minterms and the or gate for output forms the logical sum of minterms and x decoder c figure implementation of full adder with decoder section encoders function with long list of minterms requires an or gate with large number of inputs function having list of minterms can be expressed in its complemented form with minterms if the number of minterms in the function is greater than then can be expressed with fewer minterms in such case it is advantageous to use nor gate to sum the minterms of the output of the nor gate complements this sum and generates the normal output if nand gates are used for the decoder as in fig then the external gates must be nand gates instead of or gates this is because two level nand gate circuit implements sum of minterms function and is equivalent to two level andcor circuit encoders an encoder is digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of decoder an encoder has or fewer input lines and output lines the output lines as an aggregate generate the binary code corresponding to the input value an example of an encoder is the octal to binary encoder whose truth table is given in table it has eight inputs one for each of the octal digits and three outputs that generate the corresponding binary number it is assumed that only one input has value of at any given time the encoder can be implemented with or gates whose inputs are determined directly from the truth table output is equal to when the input octal digit is or output is for octal digits or and output is for digits or these conditions can be expressed by the following boolean output functions the encoder can be implemented with three or gates table outputs truth table of an octal to binary encoder y inputs the encoder defined in table has the limitation that only one input can be active at any given time if two inputs are active simultaneously the output produces an undefined combination for example if and are simultaneously the output of the encoder will be because all three outputs are equal to the output does not represent either binary or binary to resolve this ambiguity encoder circuits must establish an input priority to ensure that only one input is encoded if we establish higher priority for inputs with higher subscript numbers and if both and are at the same time the output will be because has higher priority than another ambiguity in the octal to binary encoder is that an output with all is generated when all the inputs are but this output is the same as when is equal to the discrepancy can be resolved by providing one more output to indicate whether at least one input is equal to priority encoder priority encoder is an encoder circuit that includes the priority function the operation of the priority encoder is such that if two or more inputs are equal to at the same time the input having the highest priority will take precedence the truth table of four input priority encoder is given in table in addition to the two outputs and the circuit has third output designated by this is valid bit indicator that is set to when one or more inputs are equal to if all inputs are there is no valid input and is equal to the other two outputs are not inspected when equals and are specified as dont care conditions note that whereas xs in output columns represent dont care conditions the xs in the input columns are useful for representing truth table in condensed form instead of listing all minterms of four variables the truth table uses an to represent either or for example represents the two minterms and according to table the higher the subscript number the higher the priority of the input input has the highest priority so regardless of the values of the other inputs when this input is the output for xy is binary has the next priority level the output is if provided that regardless of the values of the other two lower priority inputs the output for is generated only if higher priority inputs are and so on down the priority levels table outputs truth table of priority encoder y inputs xx xx xxx section encoders x d x figure maps for priority encoder the maps for simplifying outputs and are shown in fig the minterms for the two functions are derived from table although the table has only five rows when each in row is replaced first by and then by we obtain all possible input combinations for example the fourth row in the table with inputs represents the four minterms and simplified boolean expressions for the priority encoder are obtained from the maps the condition for output is an or function of all the input variables the priority encoder is implemented in fig according to the following boolean functions x figure four input priority encoder multiplexers multiplexer is combinational circuit that selects binary information from one of many input lines and directs it to single output line the selection of particular input line is controlled by set of selection lines normally there are input lines and selection lines whose bit combinations determine which input is selected two to one line multiplexer connects one of two sources to common destination as shown in fig the circuit has two data input lines one output line and one selection line when the upper and gate is enabled and has path to the output when the lower and gate is enabled and has path to the output the multiplexer acts like an electronic switch that selects one of two sources the block diagram of multiplexer is sometimes depicted by wedge shaped symbol as shown in fig it suggests visually how selected one of multiple data sources is directed into single destination the multiplexer is often labeled mux in block diagrams four to one line multiplexer is shown in fig each of the four inputs through is applied to one input of an and gate selection lines and are decoded to select particular and gate the outputs of the and gates are applied to single or gate that provides the one line output the function table lists the input that is passed to the output for each combination of the binary selection values to demonstrate the operation of the circuit consider the case when the and gate associated with input has two of its inputs equal to and the third input connected to the other three and gates have at least one input equal to which makes their outputs equal to the output of the or gate is now equal to the value of providing path from the selected input to the output multiplexer is also called data selector since it selects one of many inputs and steers the binary information to the output line the and gates and inverters in the multiplexer resemble decoder circuit and indeed they decode the selection input lines in general multiplexer is constructed from an decoder by adding input lines to it one to each and gate the outputs of the and gates are applied to single or gate the size of multiplexer is specified by mux s block diagram logic diagram figure two to one line multiplexer section multiplexers y logic diagram figure function table four to one line multiplexer the number of its data input lines and the single output line the selection lines are implied from the data lines as in decoders multiplexers may have an enable input to control the operation of the unit when the enable input is in the inactive state the outputs are disabled and when it is in the active state the circuit functions as normal multiplexer multiplexer circuits can be combined with common selection inputs to provide multiple bit selection logic as an illustration quadruple multiplexer is shown in fig the circuit has four multiplexers each capable of selecting one of two input lines output can be selected to come from either input or input similarly output may have the value of or and so on input selection line selects one of the lines in each of the four multiplexers the enable input must be active e asserted for normal operation although the circuit contains four multiplexers we are more likely to view it as circuit that selects one of two sets of data lines as shown in the function table the unit is enabled when then if the four inputs have path to the four outputs if by contrast the four inputs are applied to the outputs the outputs have all when regardless of the value of boolean function implementation in section it was shown that decoder can be used to implement boolean functions by employing external or gates an examination of the logic diagram of multiplexer reveals that it is essentially decoder that includes the or gate within the unit the s output x all select select function table select enable figure quadruple two to one line multiplexer minterms of function are generated in multiplexer by the circuit associated with the selection inputs the individual minterms can be selected by the data inputs thereby providing method of implementing boolean function of variables with multiplexer that has selection inputs and data inputs one for each minterm we will now show more efficient method for implementing boolean function of variables with multiplexer that has selection inputs the first variables of the function are connected to the selection inputs of the multiplexer the remaining single variable of the function is used for the data inputs if the single variable is denoted section multiplexers by each data input of the multiplexer will be or to demonstrate this procedure consider the boolean function this function of three variables can be implemented with four to one line multiplexer as shown in fig the two variables and are applied to the selection lines in that order is connected to the input and to the input the values for the data input lines are determined from the truth table of the function when xy output is equal to because when and when this requires that variable be applied to data input operation of the multiplexer is such that when xy data input has path to the output and that makes equal to in similar fashion we can determine the required input to data lines and from the value of when xy and respectively this particular example shows all four possibilities that can be obtained for the data inputs the general procedure for implementing any boolean function of variables with multiplexer with selection inputs and data inputs follows from the previous example to begin with boolean function is listed in truth table then first variables in the table are applied to the selection inputs of the multiplexer for each combination of the selection variables we evaluate the output as function of the last variable this function can be the variable or the complement of the variable these values are then applied to the data inputs in the proper order as second example consider the implementation of the boolean function this function is implemented with multiplexer with three selection inputs as shown in fig note that the first variable must be connected to selection input so that and correspond to selection inputs and respectively the values for the mux x zf fz z f truth table multiplexer implementation figure implementing boolean function with multiplexer b df fd mux fd b f f fd figure implementing four input function with multiplexer data inputs are determined from the truth table listed in the figure the corresponding data line number is determined from the binary combination of abc for example the table shows that when abc so the input variable is applied to data input the binary constants and correspond to two fixed signal values when integrated circuits are used logic corresponds to signal ground and logic is equivalent to the power signal depending on the technology g three state gates multiplexer can be constructed with three state gatesdigital circuits that exhibit three states two of the states are signals equivalent to logic and logic as in conventional gate the third state is high impedance state in which the logic behaves like an open circuit which means that the output appears to be disconnected the circuit has no logic significance and the circuit connected to the output of the three state gate is not affected by the inputs to the gate three state gates may perform any conventional logic such as and or nand however the one most commonly used is the buffer gate the graphic symbol for three state buffer gate is shown in fig it is distinguished from normal buffer by an input control line entering the bottom of the symbol the buffer has normal input an output and control input that determines the state of the output when the control input is equal to the output is enabled and the gate behaves like conventional buffer with the output equal to the normal input when the control section multiplexers normal input output a if high impedance if control input figure graphic symbol for three state buffer input is the output is disabled and the gate goes to high impedance state regardless of the value in the normal input the high impedance state of three state gate provides special feature not available in other gates because of this feature large number of three state gate outputs can be connected with wires to form common line without endangering loading effects the construction of multiplexers with three state buffers is demonstrated in fig figure shows the construction of two to one line multiplexer with three state buffers and an inverter the two outputs are connected together to form single output line note that this type of connection cannot be made with gates that do not have three state outputs when the select input is the upper buffer is enabled by its control input and the lower buffer is disabled output is then equal to input when the select input is the lower buffer is enabled and is equal to the construction of four to one line multiplexer is shown in fig the outputs of three state buffers are connected together to form single output line the control inputs to the buffers determine which one of the four normal inputs through a b select select enable decoder mux en figure multiplexers with three state gates mux will be connected to the output line no more than one buffer may be in the active state at any given time the connected buffers must be controlled so that only threestate buffer has access to the output while all other buffers are maintained in highimpedance state one way to ensure that no more than one control input is active at any given time is to use decoder as shown in the diagram when the enable input of the decoder is all of its four outputs are and the bus line is in high impedance state because all four buffers are disabled when the enable input is active one of the threestate buffers will be active depending on the binary value in the select inputs of the decoder careful investigation reveals that this circuit is another way of constructing four to one line multiplexer hdl models of combinational circuits the verilog hdl was introduced in section in the current section we introduce additional features of verilog present more elaborate examples and compare alternative descriptions of combinational circuits in verilog sequential circuits are presented in chapter as mentioned previously the module is the basic building block for modeling hardware with the verilog hdl the logic of module can be described in any one or combination of the following modeling styles gate level modeling using instantiations of predefined and user defined primitive gates dataflow modeling using continuous assignment statements with the keyword assign behavioral modeling using procedural assignment statements with the keyword always gate level structural modeling describes circuit by specifying its gates and how they are connected with each other dataflow modeling is used mostly for describing the boolean equations of combinational logic well also consider here behavioral modeling that is used to describe combinational and sequential circuits at higher level of abstraction combinational logic can be designed with truth tables boolean equations and schematics verilog has construct corresponding to each of these classical approaches to design user defined primitives continuous assignments and primitives as shown in fig is one other modeling style called switch level modeling it is sometimes used in the simulation of mos transistor circuit models but not in logic synthesis we will not consider switch level modeling gate level modeling gate level modeling was introduced in section with simple example in this type of representation circuit is specified by its logic gates and their interconnections gatelevel modeling provides textual description of schematic diagram the verilog hdl section hdl models of combinational circuits verilog model combinational logic continuous assignment boolean equation truth table schematic figure relationship of verilog constructs to truth tables boolean equations and schematics includes basic gates as predefined primitives four of these primitive gates are of the three state type the other eight are the same as the ones listed in section they are all declared with the lowercase keywords and nand or nor xor xnor not and buf primitives such as and are input primitives they can have any number of scalar inputs g three input and primitive the buf and not primitives are output primitives single input can drive multiple output lines distinguished by their identifiers the verilog language includes functional description of each type of gate too the logic of each gate is based on four valued system when the gates are simulated the simulator assigns one value to the output of each gate at any instant in addition to the two logic values of and there are two other values unknown and high impedance an unknown value is denoted by and high impedance by an unknown value is assigned during simulation when the logic value of signal is ambiguousfor instance if it cannot be determined whether its value is or g flip flop without reset condition high impedance condition occurs at the output of three state gates that are not enabled or if wire is inadvertently left unconnected the four valued logic truth tables for the and or xor and not primitives are shown in table the truth table for the other four gates is the same except that the outputs are complemented note that for the and gate the output is only when both inputs are and the output is if any input is otherwise if one input is or the output is the output of the or gate is if both inputs are is if any input is and is otherwise when primitive gate is listed in module we say that it is instantiated in the module in general component instantiations are statements that reference lower level components in the design essentially creating unique copies or instances of those components in the higher level module thus module that uses gate in its description is said to table truth table for predefined primitive gates and z or z xx x xx z xx xor z not input output xxxx x xxxx x instantiate the gate think of instantiation as the hdl counterpart of placing and connecting parts on circuit board we now present two examples of gate level modeling both examples use identifiers having multiple bit widths called vectors the syntax specifying vector includes within square brackets two numbers separated with colon the following verilog statements specify two vectors output wire sum the first statement declares an output vector with four bits through the second declares wire vector sum with eight bits numbered through note the first leftmost number array index listed is always the most significant bit of the vector the individual bits are specified within square brackets so specifies bit of it is also possible to address parts contiguous bits of vectors for example specifies the three least significant bits of vector sum hdl example shows the gate level description of two to four line decoder see fig this decoder has two data inputs and and an enable input the four outputs are specified with the vector the wire declaration is for internal connections three not gates produce the complement of the inputs and four nand gates provide the outputs for remember that the output is always listed first in the port list of primitive followed by the inputs this example describes the decoder of fig and follows the procedures established in section note that the keywords not and nand are written only once and do not have to be repeated for each gate but commas must be inserted at the end of each of the gates in the series except for the last statement which must be terminated with semicolon section hdl models of combinational circuits hdl example two to four line decoder gate level description of two to four line decoder refer to fig with symbol replaced by enable for clarity module enable output input input enable wire not not enable not not not not enable not enable nand not not enable not not enable not not enable not enable not endmodule two or more modules can be combined to build hierarchical description of design there are two basic types of design methodologies top down and bottom up in top down design the top level block is defined and then the subblocks necessary to build the top level block are identified in bottom up design the building blocks are first identified and then combined to build the top level block take for example the binary adder of fig it can be considered as top block component built with four full adder blocks while each full adder is built with two half adder blocks in top down design the four bit adder is defined first and then the two adders are described in bottom up design the half adder is defined then each full adder is constructed and then the four bit adder is built from the full adders bottom up hierarchical description of four bit adder is shown in hdl example the half adder is defined by instantiating primitive gates the next module describes the full adder by instantiating and connecting two half adders the third module describes the four bit adder by instantiating and connecting four full adders note that the first character of an identifier cannot be number but can be an underscore so the module name is valid an alternative name that is meaningful but does not require leading underscore is the instantiation is done by using the name of the module that is instantiated together with new or the same set of port names for example the half adder inside the full adder module is instantiated with ports and this produces half adder with outputs and and inputs and hdl example ripple carry adder gate level description of four bit ripple carry adder description of half adder fig module half adder verilog syntax output input module half adder output input verilog syntax instantiate primitive gates xor and endmodule description of full adder fig verilog syntax module full adder output input module full adder output input verilog syntax wire instantiate half adders half adder half adder or endmodule description of four bit adder fig verilog syntax module sum output sum output input input alternative verilog syntax module output sum output input input wire intermediate carries instantiate chain of full adders full adder endmodule hdl example illustrates verilog syntax which eliminates extra typing of identifiers declaring the mode g output type reg and declaration of vector range g of port the first version of the standard uses separate statements for these declarations section hdl models of combinational circuits note that modules can be instantiated nested within other modules but module declarations cannot be nested that is module definition declaration cannot be placed within another module declaration in other words module definition cannot be inserted into the text between the module and endmodule keywords of another module the only way one module definition can be incorporated into another module is by instantiating it instantiating modules within other modules creates hierarchical decomposition of design description of module is said to be structural description if it is composed of instantiations of other modules note also that instance names must be specified when defined modules are instantiated such as for the first full adder in the third module but using name is optional when instantiating primitive gates module is composed of instantiated and interconnected full adders each of which is itself composed of half adders and some glue logic the top level or parent module of the design hierarchy is the module four copies of full adder are its child modules etc is an input of the cell forming the least significant bit of the chain and is the output of the cell forming the most significant bit three state gates as mentioned in section three state gate has control input that can place the gate into high impedance state the high impedance state is symbolized by in verilog there are four types of three state gates as shown in fig the gate behaves like normal buffer if control the output goes to high impedance state when control the gate behaves in similar fashion except that the high impedance state occurs when control the two notif gates operate in similar manner except that the output is the complement of the input when the gate is not in high impedance state the gates are instantiated with the statement gate name input in out in out control control in out in out control control figure three state gates the gate name can be that of any of the three state gates in simulation the output can result in or two examples of gate instantiation are out control enable in the first example input is transferred to out when control out goes to when control in the second example output when enable and output when enable the outputs of three state gates can be connected together to form common output line to identify such connection verilog hdl uses the keyword tri for tristate to indicate that the output has multiple drivers as an example consider the two to oneline multiplexer with three state gates shown in fig the hdl description must use tri data type for the output mux with three state output module mux tri out select output out input select tri out out select out select endmodule the three state buffers have the same output in order to show that they have common connection it is necessary to declare out with the keyword tri keywords wire and tri are examples of set of data types called nets which represent connections between hardware elements in simulation their value is determined by continuous assignment statement or by the device whose output they represent the word net is not keyword but represents class of data types such as wire wor wand tri and the wire declaration is used most frequently in fact if an identifier is used but not declared the language specifies that it will be interpreted by default as wire the net wor models the hardware implementation of the wired or configuration emitter coupled logic the wand models the wired and configuration open collector technology see fig the nets and represent power supply and ground respectively they are used to hardwire an input of device to either or m out select figure two to one line multiplexer with three state buffers section hdl models of combinational circuits dataflow modeling dataflow modeling of combinational logic uses number of operators that act on binary operands to produce binary result verilog hdl provides about different operators table lists some of these operators their symbols and the operation that they perform complete list of operators supported by verilog can be found in table in section it is necessary to distinguish between arithmetic and logic operations so different symbols are used for each the plus symbol indicates the arithmetic operation of addition the bitwise logic and operation conjunction uses the symbol there are special symbols for bitwise logical or disjunction not and xor the equality symbol uses two equals signs without spaces between them to distinguish it from the equals sign used with the assign statement the bitwise operators operate bit by bit on pair of vector operands to produce vector result the concatenation operator provides mechanism for appending multiple operands for example two operands with two bits each can be concatenated to form an operand with four bits the conditional operator acts like multiplexer and is explained later in conjunction with hdl example it should be noted that bitwise operator g and its corresponding logical operator g may produce different results depending on their operand if the operands are scalar the results will be identical if the operands are vectors the result will not necessarily match for example is and is binary value is considered to be logically true if it is not in general use the bitwise operators to describe arithmetic operations and the logical operators to describe logical operations dataflow modeling uses continuous assignments and the keyword assign continuous assignment is statement that assigns value to net the data type family net is used in verilog hdl to represent physical connection between circuit elements net table some verilog hdl operators symbol operation symbol operation binary addition binary subtraction bitwise and logical and bitwise or logical or bitwise xor bitwise not logical not equality greater than less than concatenation conditional is declared explicitly by net keyword g wire or by declaring an identifier to be an input port the logic value associated with net is determined by what the net is connected to if the net is connected to an output of gate the net is said to be driven by the gate and the logic value of the net is determined by the logic values of the inputs to the gate and the truth table of the gate if the identifier of net is the left hand side of continuous assignment statement or procedural assignment statement the value assigned to the net is specified by boolean expression that uses operands and operators as an example assuming that the variables were declared two to one line multiplexer with scalar data inputs and select input and output is described with the continuous assignment assign the relationship between and is declared by the keyword assign followed by the target output and an equals sign following the equals sign is boolean expression in hardware terms this assignment would be equivalent to connecting the output of the or gate to wire the next two examples show the dataflow models of the two previous gate level examples the dataflow description of two to four line decoder with active low output enable and inverted output is shown in hdl example the circuit is defined with four continuous assignment statements using boolean expressions one for each output the dataflow description of the four bit adder is shown in hdl example the addition logic is described by single statement using the operators of addition and concatenation the plus symbol specifies the binary addition of the four bits of with the four bits of and the one bit of in the target output is the concatenation of the output carry out and the four bits of sum concatenation of operands is expressed within braces and comma separating the operands thus out sum represents the five bit result of the addition operation hdl example dataflow two to four line decoder dataflow description of two to four line decoder see fig note the figure uses symbol but the verilog model uses enable to clearly indicate functionality module verilog syntax output input enable assign enable enable enable enable endmodule section hdl models of combinational circuits hdl example dataflow four bit adder dataflow description of four bit adder verilog module port syntax module binary adder sum output out output input in input assign out sum b in endmodule dataflow hdl models describe combinational circuits by their function rather than by their gate structure to show how dataflow descriptions facilitate digital design consider the magnitude comparator described in hdl example the module specifies two inputs and and three outputs one output lt is logic if is less than second output gt is logic if is greater than and third output eq is logic if is equal to note that equality identity is symbolized with two equals signs to distinguish the operation from that of the assignment operator verilog hdl synthesis compiler can accept this module description as input execute synthesis algorithms and provide an output netlist and schematic of circuit equivalent to the one in fig all without manual intervention the designer need not draw the schematic hdl example dataflow four bit comparator dataflow description of four bit comparator syntax module mag compare output lt eq gt input assign lt b assign gt b assign eq b endmodule the next example uses the conditional operator this operator takes three operands condition true expression false expression the condition is evaluated if the result is logic the true expression is evaluated and used to assign value to the left hand side of an assignment statement if the result is logic the false expression is evaluated the two conditions together are equivalent to an ifcelse condition hdl example describes two to one line multiplexer using the conditional operator the continuous assignment assign out select specifies the condition that out if select else out if select hdl example dataflow two to one multiplexer dataflow description of two to one line multiplexer module select output out input input select assign out select endmodule behavioral modeling behavioral modeling represents digital circuits at functional and algorithmic level it is used mostly to describe sequential circuits but can also be used to describe combinational circuits here we give two simple combinational circuit examples to introduce the subject behavioral modeling is presented in more detail in section after the study of sequential circuits behavioral descriptions use the keyword always followed by an optional event control expression and list of procedural assignment statements the event control expression specifies when the statements will execute the target output of procedural assignment statement must be of the reg data type contrary to the wire data type whereby the target output of an assignment may be continuously updated reg data type retains its value until new value is assigned hdl example shows the behavioral description of two to one line multiplexer compare it with hdl example since variable out is target output it must be declared as reg data in addition to the output declaration the procedural assignment statements inside the always block are executed every time there is change in any of the variables listed after the symbol note that there is no semicolon at the end of the always statement in this case these variables are the input variables and select the statements execute if or select changes value note that the keyword or instead of the bitwise logical or operator is used between variables the conditional statement ifcelse provides decision based upon the value of the select input the if statement can be written without the equality symbol if select out the statement implies that select is checked for logic section hdl models of combinational circuits hdl example behavioral two to one line multiplexer behavioral description of two to one line multiplexer module out select output out input select reg out always or or select if select out else out endmodule hdl example describes the function of four to one line multiplexer the select input is defined as two bit vector and output is declared to have type reg the always statement in this example has sequential block enclosed between the keywords case and endcase the block is executed whenever any of the inputs listed after the symbol changes in value the case statement is multiway conditional branch construct whenever or select change the case expression select is evaluated and its value compared from top to bottom with the values in the list of statements that follow the so called case items the statement associated with the first case item that matches the case expression is executed in the absence of match no statement is executed since select is two bit number it can be equal to or the case items have an implied priority because the list is evaluated from top to bottom the list is called sensitivity list verilog and is equivalent to the event control expression verilog formed by oring the signals combinational logic is reactivewhen an input changes an output may change hdl example behavioral four to one line multiplexer behavioral description of four to one line multiplexer verilog port syntax module output reg out input input select always select verilog syntax case select out out out out endcase endmodule binary numbers in verilog are specified and interpreted with the letter preceded by prime the size of the number is written first and then its value thus specifies two bit binary number whose value is numbers are stored as bit pattern in memory but they can be referenced in decimal octal or hexadecimal formats with the letters do and respectively for example and have the same internal representation in simulator if the base of the number is not specified its interpretation defaults to decimal if the size of the number is not specified the system assumes that the size of the number is at least bits if host simulator has larger word lengthsay bitsthe language will use that value to store unsized numbers the integer data type keyword integer is stored in representation the underscore may be inserted in number to improve readability of the code g it has no other effect the case construct has two important variations casex and casez the first will treat as dont cares any bits of the case expression or the case item that have logic value or the casez construct treats as dont cares only the logic value for the purpose of detecting match between the case expression and case item the list of case items need not be complete if the list of case items does not include all possible bit patterns of the case expression no match can be detected unlisted case items e bit patterns that are not explicitly decoded can be treated by using the default keyword as the last item in the list of case items the associated statement will execute when no other match is found this feature is useful for example when there are more possible state codes in sequential machine than are actually used having default case item lets the designer map all of the unused states to desired next state without having to elaborate each individual state rather than allowing the synthesis tool to arbitrarily assign the next state the examples of behavioral descriptions of combinational circuits shown here are simple ones behavioral modeling and procedural assignment statements require knowledge of sequential circuits and are covered in more detail in section writing simple test bench test bench is an hdl program used for describing and applying stimulus to an hdl model of circuit in order to test it and observe its response during simulation test benches can be quite complex and lengthy and may take longer to develop than the design that is tested the results of test are only as good as the test bench that is used to test circuit care must be taken to write stimuli that will test circuit thoroughly exercising all of the operating features that are specified however the test benches considered here are relatively simple since the circuits we want to test implement only combinational logic the examples are presented to demonstrate some basic features of hdl stimulus modules chapter considers test benches in greater depth in addition to employing the always statement test benches use the initial statement to provide stimulus to the circuit being tested we use the term always statement loosely actually always is verilog language construct specifying how the associated statement is to execute subject to the event control expression the always statement section hdl models of combinational circuits executes repeatedly in loop the initial statement executes only once starting from simulation time and may continue with any operations that are delayed by given number of time units as specified by the symbol for example consider the initial block initial begin b a end the block is enclosed between the keywords begin and end at time and are set to ten time units later is changed to twenty time units after that at a is changed to and to inputs specified by three bit truth table can be generated with the initial block initial begin repeat d end when the simulator runs the three bit vector is initialized to at time the keyword repeat specifies looping statement is incremented by seven times once every time units the result is sequence of binary numbers from to stimulus module has the following form module test module name declare local reg and wire identifiers instantiate the design module under test specify stopwatch using finish to terminate the simulation generate stimulus using initial and always statements display the output response text or graphics or both endmodule test module is written like any other module but it typically has no inputs or outputs the signals that are applied as inputs to the design module for simulation are declared in the stimulus module as local reg data type the outputs of the design module that are displayed for testing are declared in the stimulus module as local wire data type the module under test is then instantiated using the local identifiers in its port list figure clarifies this relationship the stimulus module generates inputs for the design module by declaring local identifiers a and b as reg type and checks the output of the design unit with the wire identifier c the local identifiers are then used to instantiate the design module being tested the simulator associates the actual local identifiers within the test bench a b and c with the formal identifiers of the module circuit module circuit reg a b wire c input parameter stop time output circuit c a b description goes here stimulus generators for endmodule a and b go here initial stop time finish endmodule figure interaction between stimulus and design modules module the association shown here is based on position in the port list which is adequate for the examples that we will consider the reader should note however that verilog provides more flexible name association mechanism for connecting ports in larger circuits the response to the stimulus generated by the initial and always blocks will appear in text format as standard output and as waveforms timing diagrams in simulators having graphical output capability numerical outputs are displayed by using verilog system tasks these are built in system functions that are recognized by keywords that begin with the symbol some of the system tasks that are useful for display are displaydisplay one time value of variables or strings with an end of line return writesame as display but without going to next line monitordisplay variables whenever value changes during simulation run timedisplay the simulation time finishterminate the simulation the syntax for display write and monitor is of the form task name format specification argumentlist the format specification uses the symbol to specify the radix of the numbers that are displayed and may have string enclosed in quotes the base may be binary decimal hexadecimal or octal identified with the symbols and respectively and are valid too for example the statement display specifies the display of in decimal and of and in binary note that there are no commas in the format specification that the format specification and argument list section hdl models of combinational circuits are separated by comma and that the argument list has commas between the variables an example that specifies string enclosed in quotes may look like the statement display time time and will produce the display time b where time and are part of the string to be displayed the format specifiers and specify the base for time and respectively in displaying time values it is better to use the format instead of this provides display of the significant digits without the leading spaces that will include will display about leading spaces because time is calculated as number an example of stimulus module is shown in hdl example the circuit to be tested is the two to one line multiplexer described in example the module has no ports the inputs for the mux are declared with reg keyword and the outputs with wire keyword the mux is instantiated with the local variables the initial block specifies sequence of binary values to be applied during the simulation the output response is checked with the monitor system task every time variable in its argument changes value the simulator displays the inputs output and time the result of the simulation is listed under the simulation log in the example it shows that out when select

circuit is correct there are two types of verification functional and timing in functional verification we study the circuit logical operation independently of timing considerations this can be done by deriving the truth table of the combinational circuit in timing verification we study the circuits operation by including the effect of delays through the gates this can be done by observing the waveforms at the outputs of the gates when they respond to given input an example of circuit with gate delays was presented in section in hdl example we next show an hdl example that produces the truth table of combinational circuit monitor system task displays the output caused by the given stimulus commented alternative statement having display task would create header that could be used with monitor statement to eliminate the repetition of names on each line of output the analysis of combinational circuits was covered in section multilevel circuit of full adder was analyzed and its truth table was derived by inspection the gate level description of this circuit is shown in hdl example the circuit has three inputs two outputs and nine gates the description of the circuit follows the interconnections between the gates according to the schematic diagram of fig the stimulus for the circuit is listed in the second module the inputs for simulating the circuit are specified with three bit reg vector is equivalent to input to input and to input the outputs of the circuit and are declared as wire the complement of is named to illustrate common industry practice for designating the complement of signal instead of appending not this procedure section hdl models of combinational circuits follows the steps outlined in fig the repeat loop provides the seven binary numbers after

truth table exclusivecor comparator multiplexer decoder priority encoder three state inverter three state buffer synchronous sequential logic introduction hand held devices cell phones navigation receivers personal computers digital cameras personal media players and virtually all electronic consumer products have the ability to send receive store retrieve and process information represented in binary format the technology enabling and supporting these devices is critically dependent on electronic components that can store information e have memory this chapter examines the operation and control of these devices and their use in circuits and enables you to better understand what is happening in these devices when you interact with them the digital circuits considered thus far have been combinationaltheir output depends only and immediately on their inputsthey have no memory e dependence on past values of their inputs sequential circuits however act as storage elements and have memory they can store retain and then retrieve information when needed at later time our treatment will distinguish sequential logic from combinational logic sequential circuits block diagram of sequential circuit is shown in fig it consists of combinational circuit to which storage elements are connected to form feedback path the storage elements are devices capable of storing binary information the binary information stored in these elements at any given time defines the state of the sequential circuit at that time the sequential circuit receives binary information from external inputs that together with the present state of the storage elements determine the binary value of the outputs these external inputs also determine the condition for changing the state section sequential circuits inputs outputs combinational memory circuit elements figure block diagram of sequential circuit in the storage elements the block diagram demonstrates that the outputs in sequential circuit are function not only of the inputs but also of the present state of the storage elements the next state of the storage elements is also function of external inputs and the present state thus sequential circuit is specified by time sequence of inputs outputs and internal states in contrast the outputs of combinational logic depend only on the present values of the inputs there are two main types of sequential circuits and their classification is function of the timing of their signals synchronous sequential circuit is system whose behavior can be defined from the knowledge of its signals at discrete instants of time the behavior of an asynchronous sequential circuit depends upon the input signals at any instant of time and the order in which the inputs change the storage elements commonly used in asynchronous sequential circuits are time delay devices the storage capability of time delay device varies with the time it takes for the signal to propagate through the device in practice the internal propagation delay of logic gates is of sufficient duration to produce the needed delay so that actual delay units may not be necessary in gate type asynchronous systems the storage elements consist of logic gates whose propagation delay provides the required storage thus an asynchronous sequential circuit may be regarded as combinational circuit with feedback because of the feedback among logic gates an asynchronous sequential circuit may become unstable at times the instability problem imposes many difficulties on the designer these circuits will not be covered in this text synchronous sequential circuit employs signals that affect the storage elements at only discrete instants of time synchronization is achieved by timing device called clock generator which provides clock signal having the form of periodic train of clock pulses the clock signal is commonly denoted by the identifiers clock and clk the clock pulses are distributed throughout the system in such way that storage elements are affected only with the arrival of each pulse in practice the clock pulses determine when computational activity will occur within the circuit and other signals external inputs and otherwise determine what changes will take place affecting the storage elements and the outputs for example circuit that is to add and store two binary numbers would compute their sum from the values of the numbers and store the sum at the occurrence of clock pulse synchronous sequential circuits that use clock pulses to control storage elements are called clocked sequential circuits and are the type most frequently encountered in practice they are called synchronous circuits because the activity within the circuit and the resulting updating of stored values is synchronized to the occurrence of inputs outputs combinational circuit flip flops clock pulses block diagram timing diagram of clock pulses figure synchronous clocked sequential circuit clock pulses the design of synchronous circuits is feasible because they seldom manifest instability problems and their timing is easily broken down into independent discrete steps each of which can be considered separately the storage elements memory used in clocked sequential circuits are called flipflops flip flop is binary storage device capable of storing one bit of information in stable state the output of flip flop is either or sequential circuit may use many flip flops to store as many bits as necessary the block diagram of synchronous clocked sequential circuit is shown in fig the outputs are formed by combinational logic function of the inputs to the circuit or the values stored in the flip flops or both the value that is stored in flip flop when the clock pulse occurs is also determined by the inputs to the circuit or the values presently stored in the flip flop or both the new value is stored e the flip flop is updated when pulse of the clock signal occurs prior to the occurrence of the clock pulse the combinational logic forming the next value of the flip flop must have reached stable value consequently the speed at which the combinational logic circuits operate is critical if the clock synchronizing pulses arrive at regular interval as shown in the timing diagram in fig the combinational logic must respond to change in the state of the flip flop in time to be updated before the next pulse arrives propagation delays play an important role in determining the minimum interval between clock pulses that will allow the circuit to operate correctly change in state of the flip flops is initiated only by clock pulse transitionfor example when the value of the clock signals changes from to when clock pulse is not active the feedback loop between the value stored in the flip flop and the value formed at the input to the flip flop is effectively broken because the flipflop outputs cannot change even if the outputs of the combinational circuit driving their inputs change in value thus the transition from one state to the next occurs only at predetermined intervals dictated by the clock pulses section storage elements latches storage elements latches storage element in digital circuit can maintain binary state indefinitely as long as power is delivered to the circuit until directed by an input signal to switch states the major differences among various types of storage elements are in the number of inputs they possess and in the manner in which the inputs affect the binary state storage elements that operate with signal levels rather than signal transitions are referred to as latches those controlled by clock transition are flip flops latches are said to be level sensitive devices flip flops are edge sensitive devices the two types of storage elements are related because latches are the basic circuits from which all flip flops are constructed although latches are useful for storing binary information and for the design of asynchronous sequential circuits they are not practical for use as storage elements in synchronous sequential circuits because they are the building blocks of flip flops however we will consider the fundamental storage mechanism used in latches before considering flip flops in the next section sr latch the sr latch is circuit with two cross coupled nor gates or two cross coupled nand gates and two inputs labeled for set and for reset the sr latch constructed with two cross coupled nor gates is shown in fig latch has two useful states when output and the latch is said to be in the set state when and it is in the reset state outputs and are normally the complement of each other however when both inputs are equal to at the same time condition in which both outputs are equal to rather than be mutually complementary occurs if both inputs are then switched to simultaneously the device will enter an unpredictable or undefined state or metastable state consequently in practical applications setting both inputs to is forbidden under normal conditions both inputs of the latch remain at unless the state has to be changed the application of momentary to the input causes the latch to go to the set state the input must go back to before any other changes take place in order to avoid the occurrence of an undefined next state that results from the forbidden input condition as shown in the function table of fig two input conditions cause the circuit to be in reset r q after r after r set forbidden logic diagram function table figure sr latch with nor gates set s q after r reset after r logic diagram forbidden function table figure sr latch with nand gates the set state the first condition is the action that must be taken by input to bring the circuit to the set state removing the active input from leaves the circuit in the same state after both inputs return to it is then possible to shift to the reset state by momentary applying to the input the can then be removed from whereupon the circuit remains in the reset state thus when both inputs and are equal to the latch can be in either the set or the reset state depending on which input was most recently if is applied to both the and inputs of the latch both outputs go to this action produces an undefined next state because the state that results from the input transitions depends on the order in which they return to it also violates the requirement that outputs be the complement of each other in normal operation this condition is avoided by making sure that are not applied to both inputs simultaneously the sr latch with two cross coupled nand gates is shown in fig it operates with both inputs normally at unless the state of the latch has to be changed the application of to the input causes output to go to putting the latch in the set state when the input goes back to the circuit remains in the set state after both inputs go back to we are allowed to change the state of the latch by placing in the input this action causes the circuit to go to the reset state and stay there even after both inputs return to the condition that is forbidden for the nand latch is both inputs being equal to at the same time an input combination that should be avoided in comparing the nand with the nor latch note that the input signals for the nand require the complement of those values used for the nor latch because the nand latch requires signal to change its state it is sometimes referred to as an sr latch the primes or sometimes bars over the letters designate the fact that the inputs must be in their complement form to activate the circuit the operation of the basic sr latch can be modified by providing an additional input signal that determines controls when the state of the latch can be changed by determining whether and or and can affect the circuit an sr latch with control input is shown in fig it consists of the basic sr latch and two additional nand gates the control input en acts as an enable signal for the other two inputs the outputs of the nand gates stay at the level as long as the enable signal remains at this is the quiescent condition for the sr latch when the enable input goes to information from the or input is allowed to affect the latch the set state is reached with and en section storage elements latches q en r next state of en x no change logic diagram no change figure reset state sr latch with control input q set state indeterminate function table active high enabled to change to the reset state the inputs must be and en in either case when en returns to the circuit remains in its current state the control input disables the circuit by applying to en so that the state of the output does not change regardless of the values of and moreover when en and both the and inputs are equal to the state of the circuit does not change these conditions are listed in the function table accompanying the diagram an indeterminate condition occurs when all three inputs are equal to this condition places on both inputs of the basic sr latch which puts it in the undefined state when the enable input goes back to one cannot conclusively determine the next state because it depends on whether the or input goes to first this indeterminate condition makes this circuit difficult to manage and it is seldom used in practice nevertheless the sr latch is an important circuit because other useful latches and flip flops are constructed from it latch transparent latch one way to eliminate the undesirable condition of the indeterminate state in the sr latch is to ensure that inputs and are never equal to at the same time this is done in the latch shown in fig this latch has only two inputs data and q en next state of en no change reset state set state logic diagram function table figure latch s r en sr sr figure graphic symbols for latches en enable the input goes directly to the input and its complement is applied to the input as long as the enable input is at the cross coupled sr latch has both inputs at the level and the circuit cannot change state regardless of the value of the input is sampled when en if the output goes to placing the circuit in the set state if output goes to placing the circuit in the reset state the latch receives that designation from its ability to hold data in its internal storage it is suited for use as temporary storage for binary information between unit and its environment the binary information present at the data input of the latch is transferred to the output when the enable input is asserted the output follows changes in the data input as long as the enable input is asserted this situation provides path from input to the output and for this reason the circuit is often called transparent latch when the enable input signal is de asserted the binary information that was present at the data input at the time the transition occurred is retained e stored at the output until the enable input is asserted again note that an inverter could be placed at the enable input then depending on the physical circuit the external enabling signal will be value of active low or active high the graphic symbols for the various latches are shown in fig latch is designated by rectangular block with inputs on the left and outputs on the right one output designates the normal output and the other with the bubble designation designates the complement output the graphic symbol for the sr latch has inputs and indicated inside the block in the case of nand gate latch bubbles are added to the inputs to indicate that setting and resetting occur with signal the graphic symbol for the latch has inputs and en indicated inside the block storage elements flip flops the state of latch or flip flop is switched by change in the control input this momentary change is called trigger and the transition it causes is said to trigger the flip flop the latch with pulses in its control input is essentially flip flop that is triggered every time the pulse goes to the level as long as the pulse input remains at this level any changes in the data input will change the output and the state of the latch section storage elements flip flops as seen from the block diagram of fig sequential circuit has feedback path from the outputs of the flip flops to the input of the combinational circuit consequently the inputs of the flip flops are derived in part from the outputs of the same and other flip flops when latches are used for the storage elements serious difficulty arises the state transitions of the latches start as soon as the clock pulse changes to the level the new state of latch appears at the output while the pulse is still active this output is connected to the inputs of the latches through the combinational circuit if the inputs applied to the latches change while the clock pulse is still at the level the latches will respond to new values and new output state may occur the result is an unpredictable situation since the state of the latches may keep changing for as long as the clock pulse stays at the active level because of this unreliable operation the output of latch cannot be applied directly or through combinational logic to the input of the same or another latch when all the latches are triggered by common clock source flip flop circuits are constructed in such way as to make them operate properly when they are part of sequential circuit that employs common clock the problem with the latch is that it responds to change in the level of clock pulse as shown in fig positive level response in the enable input allows changes in the output when the input changes while the clock pulse stays at logic the key to the proper operation of flip flop is to trigger it only during signal transition this can be accomplished by eliminating the feedback path that is inherent in the operation of the sequential circuit using latches clock pulse goes through two transitions from to and the return from to as shown in fig the positive transition is defined as the positive edge and the negative transition as the negative edge there are two ways that latch can be modified to form flip flop one way is to employ two latches in special configuration that isolates the output of the flip flop and prevents it from being affected while the input to the flip flop is changing another way is to produce flip flop that response to positive level positive edge response negative edge response figure clock response in latch and flip flop triggers only during signal transition from to or from to of the synchronizing signal clock and is disabled during the rest of the clock pulse we will now proceed to show the implementation of both types of flip flops edge triggered flip flop the construction of d flip flop with two latches and an inverter is shown in fig the first latch is called the master and the second the slave the circuit samples the input and changes its output only at the negative edge of the synchronizing or controlling clock designated as clk when the clock is the output of the inverter is the slave latch is enabled and its output is equal to the master output the master latch is disabled because clk when the input pulse changes to the level the data from the external input are transferred to the master the slave however is disabled as long as the clock remains at the level because its enable input is equal to any change in the input changes the master output at but cannot affect the slave output when the clock pulse returns to the master is disabled and is isolated from the input at the same time the slave is enabled and the value of is transferred to the output of the flip flop at thus change in the output of the flip flop can be triggered only by and during the transition of the clock from to the behavior of the mastercslave flip flop just described dictates that the output may change only once change in the output is triggered by the negative edge of the clock and the change may occur only during the clocks negative level the value that is produced at the output of the flip flop is the value that was stored in the master stage immediately before the negative edge occurred it is also possible to design the circuit so that the flip flop output changes on the positive edge of the clock this happens in flip flop that has an additional inverter between the clk terminal and the junction between the other inverter and input en of the master latch such flip flop is triggered with negative pulse so that the negative edge of the clock affects the master and the positive edge affects the slave and the output terminal another construction of an edge triggered flip flop uses three sr latches as shown in fig two latches respond to the external data and clk clock inputs the third latch provides the outputs for the flip flop the and inputs of the output latch d d d latch latch master slave en en clk figure mastercslave flip flop section storage elements flip flops q clk q figure type positive edge triggered flip flop are maintained at the level when clk this causes the output to remain in its present state input may be equal to or if when clk becomes changes to this causes the flip flop to go to the reset state making if there is change in the input while clk terminal remains at because is the flip flop is locked out and is unresponsive to further changes in the input when the clock returns to goes to placing the output latch in the quiescent condition without changing the output similarly if when clk goes from to changes to this causes the circuit to go to the set state making any change in while clk does not affect the output in sum when the input clock in the positive edge triggered flip flop makes positive transition the value of is transferred to a negative transition of the clock e from to does not affect the output nor is the output affected by changes in when clk is in the steady level or the level hence this type of flip flop responds to the transition from to and nothing else the timing of the response of flip flop to input data and to the clock must be taken into consideration when one is using edge triggered flip flops there is minimum time called the setup time during which the input must be maintained at constant value prior to the occurrence of the clock transition similarly there is minimum time called the hold time during which the input must not change after the application of the positive transition of the clock the propagation delay time of the flip flop is defined as the interval between the trigger edge and the stabilization of the output to new state these and other parameters are specified in manufacturers data books for specific logic families d clk clk positive edge negative edge figure graphic symbol for edge triggered flip flop the graphic symbol for the edge triggered flip flop is shown in fig it is similar to the symbol used for the latch except for the arrowhead like symbol in front of the letter clk designating dynamic input the dynamic indicator denotes the fact that the flip flop responds to the edge transition of the clock bubble outside the block adjacent to the dynamic indicator designates negative edge for triggering the circuit the absence of bubble designates positive edge response other flip flops very large scale integration circuits contain several thousands of gates within one package circuits are constructed by interconnecting the various gates to provide digital system each flip flop is constructed from an interconnection of gates the most economical and efficient flip flop constructed in this manner is the edge triggered flipflop because it requires the smallest number of gates other types of flip flops can be constructed by using the flip flop and external logic two flip flops less widely used in the design of digital systems are the jk and flip flops there are three operations that can be performed with flip flop set it to reset it to or complement its output with only single input the flip flop can set or reset the output depending on the value of the input immediately before the clock transition synchronized by clock signal the jk flip flop has two inputs and performs all three operations the circuit diagram of jk flip flop constructed with d flip flop and gates is shown in fig the input sets the flip flop to the input resets it to and when both inputs are enabled the output is complemented this can be verified by investigating the circuit applied to the input jq kq when and so the next clock edge sets the output to when and so the next clock edge resets the output to when both and the next clock edge complements the output when both and the clock edge leaves the output unchanged the graphic symbol for the jk flip flop is shown in fig it is similar to the graphic symbol of the flip flop except that now the inputs are marked and the toggle flip flop is complementing flip flop and can be obtained from jk flip flop when inputs and are tied together this is shown in fig when section storage elements flip flops d j clk clk clk k circuit diagram graphic symbol figure jk flip flop j d clk clk clk from flip flop graphic symbol from jk flip flop figure flip flop clock edge does not change the output when clock edge complements the output the complementing flip flop is useful for designing binary counters the flip flop can be constructed with d flip flop and an exclusive or gate as shown in fig the expression for the input is tq tq when and there is no change in the output when and the output complements the graphic symbol for this flip flop has t symbol in the input characteristic tables characteristic table defines the logical properties of flip flop by describing its operation in tabular form the characteristic tables of three types of flip flops are presented in table define the next state e the state that results from clock transition table flip flop characteristic tables jk flip flop k t t no change reset set t complement flip flop flip flop q t t reset no change set complement t as function of the inputs and the present state t refers to the present state e the state present prior to the application of clock edge t is the next state one clock period later note that the clock edge input is not included in the characteristic table but is implied to occur between times and thus t denotes the state of the flip flop immediately before the clock edge and t denotes the state that results from the clock transition the characteristic table for the jk flip flop shows that the next state is equal to the present state when inputs and are both equal to this condition can be expressed as t t indicating that the clock produces no change of state when and the clock resets the flip flop and t with and the flip flop sets and t when both and are equal to the next state changes to the complement of the present state transition that can be expressed as t t the next state of d flip flop is dependent only on the input and is independent of the present state this can be expressed as t it means that the next state value is equal to the value of note that the flip flop does not have no change condition such condition can be accomplished either by disabling the clock or by operating the clock by having the output of the flip flop connected into the input either method effectively circulates the output of the flip flop when the state of the flip flop must remain unchanged the characteristic table of the flip flop has only two conditions when the clock edge does not change the state when the clock edge complements the state of the flip flop section storage elements flip flops characteristic equations the logical properties of flip flop as described in the characteristic table can be expressed algebraically with characteristic equation for the flip flop we have the characteristic equation t which states that the next state of the output will be equal to the value of input in the present state the characteristic equation for the jk flip flop can be derived from the characteristic table or from the circuit of fig we obtain t jq kq where is the value of the flip flop output prior to the application of clock edge the characteristic equation for the flip flop is obtained from the circuit of fig t tq tq direct inputs some flip flops have asynchronous inputs that are used to force the flip flop to particular state independently of the clock the input that sets the flip flop to is called preset or direct set the input that clears the flip flop to is called clear or direct reset when power is turned on in digital system the state of the flip flops is unknown the direct inputs are useful for bringing all flip flops in the system to known starting state prior to the clocked operation positive edge triggered flip flop with active low asynchronous reset is shown in fig the circuit diagram is the same as the one in fig except for the additional reset input connections to three nand gates when the reset input is it forces output to stay at which in turn clears output to thus resetting the flip flop two other connections from the reset input ensure that the input of the third sr latch stays at logic while the reset input is at regardless of the values of and clk the graphic symbol for the flip flop with direct reset has an additional input marked with the bubble along the input indicates that the reset is active at the level flip flops with direct set use the symbol for the asynchronous set input the function table specifies the operation of the circuit when the output is reset to this state is independent of the values of or clk normal clock operation can proceed only after the reset input goes to logic the clock at clk is shown with an upward arrow to indicate that the flip flop triggers on the positive edge of the clock the value in is transferred to with every positive edge clock signal provided that q clock q reset circuit diagram data q clock clk clk q q x reset graphic symbol function table figure flip flop with asynchronous reset analysis of clocked sequential circuits analysis describes what given circuit will do under certain operating conditions the behavior of clocked sequential circuit is determined from the inputs the outputs and the state of its flip flops the outputs and the next state are both function of the inputs and the present state the analysis of sequential circuit consists of obtaining table or diagram for the time sequence of inputs outputs and internal states it is also possible section analysis of clocked sequential circuits to write boolean expressions that describe the behavior of the sequential circuit these expressions must include the necessary time sequence either directly or indirectly logic diagram is recognized as clocked sequential circuit if it includes flip flops with clock inputs the flip flops may be of any type and the logic diagram may or may not include combinational logic gates in this section we introduce an algebraic representation for specifying the next state condition in terms of the present state and inputs state table and state diagram are then presented to describe the behavior of the sequential circuit another algebraic representation is introduced for specifying the logic diagram of sequential circuits examples are used to illustrate the various procedures state equations the behavior of clocked sequential circuit can be described algebraically by means of state equations state equation also called transition equation specifies the next state as function of the present state and inputs consider the sequential circuit shown in fig we will later show that it acts as by asserting its output when x d clk y b clk clock figure example of sequential circuit is detected in stream of it consists of two flip flops and an input and an output since the input of flip flop determines the value of the next state e the state reached after the clock transition it is possible to write set of state equations for the circuit t t t t t t t t state equation is an algebraic expression that specifies the condition for flip flop state transition the left side of the equation with denotes the next state of the flip flop one clock edge later the right side of the equation is boolean expression that specifies the present state and input conditions that make the next state equal to since all the variables in the boolean expressions are function of the present state we can omit the designation after each variable for convenience and can express the state equations in the more compact form t ax bx t ax the boolean expressions for the state equations can be derived directly from the gates that form the combinational circuit part of the sequential circuit since the values of the combinational circuit determine the next state similarly the present state value of the output can be expressed algebraically as t t t t by removing the symbol for the present state we obtain the output boolean equation x state table the time sequence of inputs outputs and flip flop states can be enumerated in state table sometimes called transition table the state table for the circuit of fig is shown in table the table consists of four sections labeled present state input next state and output the present state section shows the states of flip flops and at any given time the input section gives value of for each possible present state the next state section shows the states of the flip flops one clock cycle later at time the output section gives the value of at time for each present state and input condition the derivation of state table requires listing all possible binary combinations of present states and inputs in this case we have eight binary combinations from to the next state values are then determined from the logic diagram or from the state equations the next state of flip flop must satisfy the state equation t ax bx section analysis of clocked sequential circuits table state table for the circuit of fig present input next output state state a x b the next state section in the state table under column has three where the present state of and input are both equal to or the present state of and input are both equal to similarly the next state of flip flop is derived from the state equation t ax and is equal to when the present state of is and input is equal to the output column is derived from the output equation ax bx the state table of sequential circuit with type flip flops is obtained by the same procedure outlined in the previous example in general sequential circuit with flipflops and inputs needs rows in the state table the binary numbers from through are listed under the present state and input columns the next state section has columns one for each flip flop the binary values for the next state are derived directly from the state equations the output section has as many columns as there are output variables its binary value is derived from the circuit or from the boolean function in the same manner as in truth table it is sometimes convenient to express the state table in slightly different form having only three sections present state next state and output the input conditions are enumerated under the next state and output sections the state table of table is repeated in table in this second form for each present state there are two possible next states and outputs depending on the value of the input one form may be preferable to the other depending on the application state diagram the information available in state table can be represented graphically in the form of state diagram in this type of diagram state is represented by circle and the clock triggered transitions between states are indicated by directed lines connecting table second form of the state table present next state output state b ab ab y figure state diagram of the circuit of fig the circles the state diagram of the sequential circuit of fig is shown in fig the state diagram provides the same information as the state table and is obtained directly from table or table the binary number inside each circle identifies the state of the flip flops the directed lines are labeled with two binary numbers separated by slash the input value during the present state is labeled first and the number after the slash gives the output during the present state with the given input it is important to remember that the bit value listed for the output along the directed line occurs during the present state and with the indicated input and has nothing to do with the transition to the next state for example the directed line from state to is labeled meaning that when the sequential circuit is in the present state and the input is the output is after the next clock cycle the circuit goes to the next state if the input changes to then the output becomes but if the input remains at the output stays at this information is obtained from the state diagram along the two directed lines emanating from the circle with state directed line connecting circle with itself indicates that no change of state occurs the steps presented in this example are summarized below circuit diagram equations state table state diagram section analysis of clocked sequential circuits this sequence of steps begins with structural representation of the circuit and proceeds to an abstract representation of its behavior an hdl model can be in the form of gate level description or in the form of behavioral description it is important to note that gate level approach requires that the designer understands how to select and connect gates and flip flops to form circuit having particular behavior that understanding comes with experience on the other hand an approach based on behavioral modeling does not require the designer to know how to invent schematicthe designer needs only to know how to describe behavior using the constructs of the hdl because the circuit is produced automatically by synthesis tool therefore one does not have to accumulate years of experience in order to become productive designer of digital circuits nor does one have to acquire an extensive background in electrical engineering there is no difference between state table and state diagram except in the manner of representation the state table is easier to derive from given logic diagram and the state equation the state diagram follows directly from the state table the state diagram gives pictorial view of state transitions and is the form more suitable for human interpretation of the circuits operation for example the state diagram of fig clearly shows that starting from state the output is as long as the input stays at the first input after string of gives an output of and transfers the circuit back to the initial state the machine represented by this state diagram acts to detect zero in the bit stream of data it corresponds to the behavior of the circuit in fig other circuits that detect zero in stream of data may have simpler circuit diagram and state diagram flip flop input equations the logic diagram of sequential circuit consists of flip flops and gates the interconnections among the gates form combinational circuit and may be specified algebraically with boolean expressions the knowledge of the type of flip flops and list of the boolean expressions of the combinational circuit provide the information needed to draw the logic diagram of the sequential circuit the part of the combinational circuit that generates external outputs is described algebraically by set of boolean functions called output equations the part of the circuit that generates the inputs to flip flops is described algebraically by set of boolean functions called flip flop input equations or sometimes excitation equations we will adopt the convention of using the flip flop input symbol to denote the input equation variable and subscript to designate the name of the flip flop output for example the following input equation specifies an or gate with inputs and connected to the input of flip flop whose output is labeled with the symbol dq the sequential circuit of fig consists of two flip flops and an input and an output the logic diagram of the circuit can be expressed algebraically with two flip flop input equations and an output equation da ax bx db ax x the three equations provide the necessary information for drawing the logic diagram of the sequential circuit the symbol da specifies d flip flop labeled db specifies second flip flop labeled the boolean expressions associated with these two variables and the expression for output specify the combinational circuit part of the sequential circuit the flip flop input equations constitute convenient algebraic form for specifying the logic diagram of sequential circuit they imply the type of flip flop from the letter symbol and they fully specify the combinational circuit that drives the flip flops note that the expression for the input equation for d flip flop is identical to the expression for the corresponding state equation this is because of the characteristic equation that equates the next state to the value of the input t dq analysis with flip flops we will summarize the procedure for analyzing clocked sequential circuit with flipflops by means of simple example the circuit we want to analyze is described by the input equation da the da symbol implies d flip flop with output the and variables are the inputs to the circuit no output equations are given which implies that the output comes from the output of the flip flop the logic diagram is obtained from the input equation and is drawn in fig the state table has one column for the present state of flip flop two columns for the two inputs and one column for the next state of the binary numbers under axy are listed from through as shown in fig the next state values are obtained from the state equation t the expression specifies an odd function and is equal to when only one variable is or when all three variables are this is indicated in the column for the next state of the circuit has one flip flop and two states the state diagram consists of two circles one for each state as shown in fig present state and the output can be either or as indicated by the number inside the circles slash on the directed lines is not needed because there is no output from combinational circuit the two inputs can have four possible combinations for each state two input combinations during each state transition are separated by comma to simplify the notation analysis with jk flip flops state table consists of four sections present state inputs next state and outputs the first two are obtained by listing all binary combinations the output section is determined from the output equations the next state values are evaluated from the state equations for d type flip flop the state equation is the same as the input equation when flip flop other than the type is used such as jk or it is necessary to refer section analysis of clocked sequential circuits present next state inputs state xy x a clk clock circuit diagram state table state diagram figure sequential circuit with flip flop to the corresponding characteristic table or characteristic equation to obtain the nextstate values we will illustrate the procedure first by using the characteristic table and again by using the characteristic equation the next state values of sequential circuit that uses jkor type flip flops can be derived as follows determine the flip flop input equations in terms of the present state and input variables list the binary values of each input equation use the corresponding flip flop characteristic table to determine the next state values in the state table as an example consider the sequential circuit with two jk flip flops and and one input as shown in fig the circuit has no outputs therefore the state table does not need an output column the outputs of the flip flops may be considered as the outputs in this case the circuit can be specified by the flip flop input equations ja ka bx jb kb ax ax x the state table of the sequential circuit is shown in table the present state and input columns list the eight binary combinations the binary values listed under the a clk k b clk clock figure sequential circuit with jk flip flop columns labeled flip flop inputs are not part of the state table but they are needed for the purpose of evaluating the next state as specified in step of the procedure these binary values are obtained directly from the four input equations in manner similar to that for obtaining truth table from boolean expression the next state of each flip flop is evaluated from the corresponding and inputs and the characteristic table of the jk flip flop listed in table there are four cases to consider when and table state table for sequential circuit with jk flip flops present input next flip flop state state inputs b a j k j k section analysis of clocked sequential circuits the next state is and the next state is there is no change of state and the next state value is the same as that of the present state when the next state bit is the complement of the present state bit examples of the last two cases occur in the table when the present state ab is and input is ja and ka are both equal to and the present state of is therefore the next state of remains the same and is equal to in the same row of the table jb and kb are both equal to since the present state of is the next state of is complemented and changes to the next state values can also be obtained by evaluating the state equations from the characteristic equation this is done by using the following procedure determine the flip flop input equations in terms of the present state and input variables substitute the input equations into the flip flop characteristic equation to obtain the state equations use the corresponding state equations to determine the next state values in the state table the input equations for the two jk flip flops of fig were listed couple of paragraphs ago the characteristic equations for the flip flops are obtained by substituting or for the name of the flip flop instead of t ja ka t jb kb substituting the values of ja and ka from the input equations we obtain the state equation for t ba bx ab ab ax the state equation provides the bit values for the column headed next state for in the state table similarly the state equation for flip flop can be derived from the characteristic equation by substituting the values of jb and kb t xb b bx abx abx the state equation provides the bit values for the column headed next state for in the state table note that the columns in table headed flip flop inputs are not needed when state equations are used the state diagram of the sequential circuit is shown in fig note that since the circuit has no outputs the directed lines out of the circles are marked with one binary number only to designate the value of input analysis with flip flops the analysis of sequential circuit with flip flops follows the same procedure outlined for jk flip flops the next state values in the state table can be obtained by using either figure state diagram of the circuit of fig the characteristic table listed in table or the characteristic equation t tq tq now consider the sequential circuit shown in fig it has two flip flops and one input and one output and can be described algebraically by two input equations and an output equation ta bx tb y ab the state table for the circuit is listed in table the values for are obtained from the output equation the values for the next state can be derived from the state equations by substituting ta and tb in the characteristic equations yielding t bx bx ab ax abx t b the next state values for and in the state table are obtained from the expressions of the two state equations the state diagram of the circuit is shown in fig long as input is equal to the circuit behaves as binary counter with sequence of states and back to when the circuit remains in the same state output is equal to when the present state is here the output depends on the present state only and is independent of the input the two values inside each circle and separated by slash are for the present state and output mealy and moore models of finite state machines the most general model of sequential circuit has inputs outputs and internal states it is customary to distinguish between two models of sequential circuits the mealy model and the moore model both are shown in fig differ only in the way the output section analysis of clocked sequential circuits t y clk t clk clock reset state diagram circuit diagram figure sequential circuit with flip flops binary counter table state table for sequential circuit with flip flops present input next output state state a x b mealy machine inputs next state state output outputs combinational register combinational mealy type logic logic clock moore machine inputs next state state output outputs combinational register combinational moore type logic logic clock figure block diagrams of mealy and moore state machines is generated in the mealy model the output is function of both the present state and the input in the moore model the output is function of only the present state circuit may have both types of outputs the two models of sequential circuit are commonly referred to as finite state machine abbreviated fsm the mealy model of sequential circuit is referred to as mealy fsm or mealy machine the moore model is referred to as moore fsm or moore machine the circuit presented previously in fig is an example of mealy machine output is function of both input and the present state of and the corresponding state diagram in fig shows both the input and output values separated by slash along the directed lines between the states an example of moore model is given in fig here the output is function of the present state only the corresponding state diagram in fig has only inputs marked along the directed lines the outputs are the flip flop states marked inside the circles another example of moore model is the sequential circuit of fig the output depends only on flip flop values and that makes it function of the present state only the input value in the state diagram is labeled along the directed line but the output value is indicated inside the circle together with the present state in moore model the outputs of the sequential circuit are synchronized with the clock because they depend only on flip flop outputs that are synchronized with the clock in mealy model the outputs may change if the inputs change during the clock section synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits cycle moreover the outputs may have momentary false values because of the delay encountered from the time that the inputs change and the time that the flip flop outputs change in order to synchronize mealy type circuit the inputs of the sequential circuit must be synchronized with the clock and the outputs must be sampled immediately before the clock edge the inputs are changed at the inactive edge of the clock to ensure that the inputs to the flip flops stabilize before the active edge of the clock occurs thus the output of the mealy machine is the value that is present immediately before the active edge of the clock synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits the verilog hdl was introduced in section combinational circuits were described in section and behavioral modeling with verilog was introduced in that section as well behavioral models are abstract representations of the functionality of digital hardware that is they describe how circuit behaves but dont specify the internal details of the circuit historically the abstraction has been described by truth tables state tables and state diagrams an hdl describes the functionality differently by language constructs that represent the operations of registers in machine this representation has added value e it is important for you to know how to use because it can be simulated to produce waveforms demonstrating the behavior of the machine behavioral modeling there are two kinds of abstract behaviors in the verilog hdl behavior declared by the keyword initial is called single pass behavior and specifies single statement or block statement e list of statements enclosed by either begin end or fork join keyword pair single pass behavior expires after the associated statement executes in practice designers use single pass behavior primarily to prescribe stimulus signals in test benchnever to model the behavior of circuitbecause synthesis tools do not accept descriptions that use the initial statement the always keyword declares cyclic behavior both types of behaviors begin executing when the simulator launches at time the initial behavior expires after its statement executes the always behavior executes and reexecutes indefinitely until the simulation is stopped module may contain an arbitrary number of initial or always behavioral statements they execute concurrently with respect to each other starting at time and may interact through common variables heres word description of how an always statement works for simple model of d flip flop whenever the rising edge of the clock occurs if the reset input is asserted the output gets otherwise the output gets the value of the input the execution of statements triggered by the clock is repeated until the simulation ends well see shortly how to write this description in verilog an initial behavioral statement executes only once it begins its execution at the start of simulation and expires after all of its statements have completed execution as mentioned at the end of section the initial statement is useful for generating input signals to simulate design in simulating sequential circuit it is necessary to generate clock source for triggering the flip flops the following are two possible ways to provide free running clock that operates for specified number of cycles initial initial begin begin clock clock repeat end clock clock end initial finish always clock clock in the first version the initial block contains two statements enclosed within the begin and end keywords the first statement sets clock to at time the second statement specifies loop that reexecutes times to wait time units and then complement the value of clock this produces clock cycles each with cycle time of time units in the second version the first initial behavior has single statement that sets clock to at time and it then expires causes no further simulation activity the second singlepass behavior declares stopwatch for the simulation the system task finish causes the simulation to terminate unconditionally after time units have elapsed because this behavior has only one statement associated with it there is no need to write the begin end keyword pair after time units the always statement repeatedly complements clock providing clock generator having cycle time of time units the three behavioral statements in the second example can be written in any order here is another way to describe free running clock initial begin clock forever clock clock end this version with two statements in one block statement initializes the clock and then executes an indefinite loop forever in which the clock is complemented after delay of time steps note that the single pass behavior never finishes executing and so does not expire another behavior would have to terminate the simulation the activity associated with either type of behavioral statement can be controlled by delay operator that waits for certain time or by an event control operator that waits for certain conditions to become true or for specified events changes in signals to occur time delays specified with the delay control operator are commonly used in single pass behaviors the delay control operator suspends execution of statements until specified time has elapsed weve already seen examples of its use to specify signals in test bench another operator is called the event control operator and is used to suspend activity until an event occurs an event can be an unconditional change in signal value g or specified transition of signal value g posedge clock the general form of this type of statement is always event control expression begin procedural assignment statements that execute when the condition is met end section synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits the event control expression specifies the condition that must occur to launch execution of the procedural assignment statements the variables in the left hand side of the procedural statements must be of the reg data type and must be declared as such the right hand side can be any expression that produces value using verilog defined operators the event control expression also called the sensitivity list specifies the events that must occur to initiate execution of the procedural statements associated with the always block statements within the block execute sequentially from top to bottom after the last statement executes the behavior waits for the event control expression to be satisfied then the statements are executed again the sensitivity list can specify levelsensitive events edge sensitive events or combination of the two in practice designers do not make use of the third option because this third form is not one that synthesis tools are able to translate into physical hardware level sensitive events occur in combinational circuits and in latches for example the statement always or or will initiate execution of the procedural statements in the associated always block if change occurs in or in synchronous sequential circuits changes in flip flops occur only in response to transition of clock pulse the transition may be either positive edge or negative edge of the clock but not both verilog hdl takes care of these conditions by providing two keywords posedge and negedge for example the expression always posedge clock or negedge reset verilog will initiate execution of the associated procedural statements only if the clock goes through positive transition or if reset goes through negative transition the and revisions to the verilog language allow comma separated list for the event control expression or sensitivity list always posedge clock negedge reset verilog procedural assignment is an assignment of logic value to variable within an initial or always statement this is in contrast to continuous assignment discussed in section with dataflow modeling continuous assignment has an implicit levelsensitive sensitivity list consisting of all of the variables on the right hand side of its assignment statement the updating of continuous assignment is triggered whenever an event occurs in variable included on the right hand side of its expression in contrast procedural assignment is made only when an assignment statement is executed and assigns value to it within behavioral statement for example the clock signal in the preceding example was complemented only when the statement clock clock executed the statement did not execute until time units after the simulation began it is important to remember that variable having type reg remains unchanged until procedural assignment is made to give it new value there are two kinds of procedural assignments blocking and nonblocking the two are distinguished by the symbols that they use blocking assignments use the symbol as the assignment operator and nonblocking assignments use as the operator blocking assignment statements are executed sequentially in the order they are listed in block of statements nonblocking assignments are executed concurrently by evaluating the set of expressions on the right hand side of the list of statements they do not make assignments to their left hand sides until all of the expressions are evaluated the two types of assignments may be better understood by means of an illustration consider these two procedural blocking assignments c the first statement transfers the value of into the second statement increments the value of and transfers the new value to at the completion of the assignments contains the value of now consider the two statements as nonblocking assignments c when the statements are executed the expressions on the right hand side are evaluated and stored in temporary location the value of is kept in one storage location and the value of in another after all the expressions in the block are evaluated and stored the assignment to the targets on the left hand side is made in this case will contain the original value of plus general rule is to use blocking assignments when sequential ordering is imperative and in cyclic behavior that is level sensitive e in combinational logic use nonblocking assignments when modeling concurrent execution g edge sensitive behavior such as synchronous concurrent register transfers and when modeling latched behavior nonblocking assignments are imperative in dealing with register transfer level design as shown in chapter model the concurrent operations of physical hardware synchronized by common clock todays designers are expected to know what features of an hdl are useful in practical way and how to avoid features that are not following these rules for using the assignment operators will prevent conditions that lead synthesis tools astray and create mismatches between the behavior of model and the behavior of physical hardware that is produced by synthesis tool hdl models of flip flops and latches hdl examples through show verilog descriptions of various flip flops and d latch the latch is said to be transparent because it responds to change in data input with change in the output as long as the enable input is assertedviewing the output is the same as viewing the input the description of d latch is shown in hdl example it has two inputs and enable and one output since is assigned value in behavior its type must be declared to be reg hardware latches respond to input signal levels so the two inputs are listed without edge qualifiers in the sensitivity list following the symbol in the always statement in this model there is only one blocking procedural assignment statement and it specifies the transfer of input to output if enable section synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits is true logic note that this statement is executed every time there is change in if enable is d type flip flop is the simplest example of sequential machine hdl example describes two positive edge flip flops in two modules the first responds only to the clock the second includes an asynchronous reset input output must be declared as reg data type in addition to being listed as an output this is because it is target output of procedural assignment statement the keyword posedge ensures that the transfer of input into is synchronized by the positive edge transition of clk change in at any other time does not change hdl example latch description of latch see fig module latch enable output input enable reg always enable or if enable same as if enable endmodule alternative syntax verilog module latch output reg input enable always enable if enable no action if enable not asserted endmodule hdl example type flip flop ip op without reset module ff clk output input clk reg always posedge clk endmodule ip op with asynchronous reset module dff output reg input clk rst always posedge clk negedge rst if rst same as if rst else endmodule statement single or block associated with if boolean expression executes if the boolean expression is true the second module includes an asynchronous reset input in addition to the synchronous clock specific form of an if statement is used to describe such flip flop so that the model can be synthesized by software tool the event expression after the symbol in the always statement may have any number of edge events either posedge or negedge for modeling hardware one of the events must be clock event the remaining events specify conditions under which asynchronous logic is to be executed the designer knows which signal is the clock but clock is not an identifier that software tools automatically recognize as the synchronizing signal of circuit the tool must be able to infer which signal is the clock so you need to write the description in way that enables the tool to infer the clock correctly the rules are simple to follow each if or else if statement in the procedural assignment statements is to correspond to an asynchronous event the last else statement corresponds to the clock event and the asynchronous events are tested first there are two edge events in the second module of hdl example the negedge rst reset event is asynchronous since it matches the if rst statement as long as rst is is cleared to if clk has positive transition its effect is blocked only if rst can the posedge clock event synchronously transfer into hardware always has reset signal it is strongly recommended that all models of edge sensitive behavior include reset or preset input signal otherwise the initial state of the flip flops of the sequential circuit cannot be determined sequential circuit cannot be tested with hdl simulation unless an initial state can be assigned with an input signal hdl example describes the construction of t or jk flip flop from d flip flop and gates the circuit is described with the characteristic equations of the flip flops t for t flip flop t jq kq for jk flip flop the first module tff describes t flip flop by instantiating dff instantiation is explained in section the declared wire dt is assigned the exclusive or of and as is required for building t flip flop with d flip flop the instantiation with the value of dt replacing in module dff produces the required flip flop the jk flip flop is specified in similar manner by using its characteristic equation to define replacement for in the instantiated dff hdl example alternative flip flop models ip op

negedge rst if rst else endmodule hdl example shows another way to describe jk flip flop here we describe the flip flop by using the characteristic table rather than the characteristic equation the case multiway branch condition checks the two bit number obtained by concatenating the bits of and the case expression is evaluated and compared with the values in the list of statements that follows the first value that matches the true condition is executed since the concatenation of and produces two bit number it can be equal to or the first bit gives the value of and the second the value of the four possible conditions specify the value of the next state of after the application of positive edge clock hdl example jk flip flop functional description of jk ip op module jk ff input clk output reg output b assign b always posedge clk case k endcase endmodule state diagram based hdl models an hdl model of the operation of sequential circuit can be based on the format of the circuits state diagram mealy hdl model is presented in hdl example for the zero detector machine described by the sequential circuit in fig and its state diagram shown in fig the input output clock and reset are declared in the usual manner the state of the flip flops is declared with identifiers state and next state these variables hold the values of the present state and the next value of the sequential circuit the states binary assignment is done with parameter statement verilog allows constants to be defined in module by the keyword parameter the four states through are assigned binary through notation is preferable to the alternative the former uses only two bits to store the constant whereas the latter results in binary number with or bits because an unsized number is interpreted and sized as an integer hdl example mealy machine zero detector mealy fsm zero detector see fig and fig verilog syntax module mealy zero detector output reg out input in clock reset reg state next state

sequential circuits x in x in x in x in x in x in x in x in x in x in x in x in x in x in join endmodule the circuit hdl example detects following sequence of in serial bit stream its verilog model uses three always blocks that execute concurrently and interact through common variables the first always statement resets the circuit to the initial state and specifies the synchronous clocked operation the statement state next state is synchronized to positive edge transition of the clock this means that any change in the value of next state in the second always block can affect the value of state only as result of posedge event of clock the second always block determines the value of the next state transition as function of the present state and input the value assigned to state by the nonblocking assignment is the value of next state immediately before the rising edge of clock notice how the multiway branch condition implements the state transitions specified by the annotated edges in the state diagram of fig the third always block specifies the output as function of the present state and the input although this block is listed as separate behavior for clarity it could be combined with the second block note that the value of output out may change if the value of input in changes while the circuit is in any given state so lets summarize how the model describes the behavior of the machine at every rising edge of clock if reset is not asserted the state of the machine is updated by the first always block when state is updated by the first always block the change in state is detected by the sensitivity list mechanism of the second always block then the second always block updates the value of next state it will be used by the first always block at the next tick of the clock the third always block also detects the change in state and updates the value of the output in addition the second and third always blocks detect changes in in and update next state and out accordingly the test bench provided with mealy zero detector provides some waveforms to stimulate the model producing the results shown in fig notice how y out responds to changes in both the state and the input and has glitch transient logic value we display both to and to illustrate how changes in x in influence the value of next state and y out the mealy glitch in y out is due to the intentional dynamic behavior of x in the input x in settles stream of clock reset x in y out valid mealy output mealy glitch figure simulation output of mealy zero detector to value of immediately before the clock and at the clock the state makes transition from to which is consistent with fig output is in state immediately before the clock and changes to as the state enters the description of waveforms in the test bench uses the fork join construct statements with the fork join block execute in parallel so the time delays are relative to common reference of the time at which the block begins it is usually more convenient to use the fork join block instead of the begin end block in describing waveforms notice that the waveform of reset is triggered on the fly to demonstrate that the machine recovers from an unexpected asynchronous reset condition during any state how does our verilog model mealy zero detector correspond to hardware the first always block corresponds to d flip flop implementation of the state register in fig the second always block is the combinational logic block describing the next state the third always block describes the output combinational logic of the zero detecting mealy machine the register operation of the state transition uses the nonblocking assignment operator because the edge sensitive flip flops of sequential machine are updated concurrently by common clock the second and third always blocks describe combinational logic which is level sensitive so they use the blocking assignment operator fork join block completes execution when the last executing statement within it completes its execution section synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits their sensitivity lists include both the state and the input because their logic must respond to change in either or both of them note the modeling style illustrated by mealy zero detector is commonly used by designers because it has close relationship to the state diagram of the machine that is being described notice that the reset signal is associated with the always block that synchronizes the state transitions in this example it is modeled as an active low reset because the reset condition is included in the description of the state transitions there is no need to include it in the combinational logic that specifies the next state and the output and the resulting description is less verbose simpler and more readable hdl example presents the verilog behavioral model of the moore fsm shown in fig and having the state diagram given in fig the model illustrates an alternative style in which the state transitions of the machine are described by single clocked e edge sensitive cyclic behavior e by one always block the present state of the circuit is identified by the variable state and its transitions are triggered by the rising edge of the clock according to the conditions listed in the case statement the combinational logic that determines the next state is included in the nonblocking assignment to state in this example the output of the circuits is independent of the input and is taken directly from the outputs of the flip flops the two bit output out is specified with continuous assignment statement and is equal to the value of the present state vector figure shows some simulation results for here are some important observations the output depends on only the state reset on the fly forces the state of the machine back to and the state transitions are consistent with fig hdl example moore machine zero detector moore model fsm

description of clocked sequential circuits combinational logic circuits can be described in verilog by connection of gates primitives and udps by dataflow statements continuous assignments or by levelsensitive cyclic behaviors always blocks sequential circuits are composed of combinational logic and flip flops and their hdl models use sequential udps and behavioral statements edge sensitive cyclic behaviors to describe the operation of flip flops one way to describe sequential circuit uses combination of dataflow and behavioral statements the flip flops are described with an always statement the combinational part can be described with assign statements and boolean equations the separate modules can be combined to form structural model by instantiation within module the structural description of moore type zero detector sequential circuit is shown in hdl example we want to encourage the reader to consider alternative ways to model circuit so as point of comparison we first present verilog behavioral description of binary counter having the state diagram examined earlier shown in fig this style of modeling follows directly from the state diagram an alternative style used in represents the structure shown in fig this style uses two modules the first describes the circuit of fig the second describes the flip flop that will be used by the circuit we also show two ways to model the flip flop the first asserts that at every clock tick the value of the output of the flip flop toggles if the toggle input is asserted the second model describes the behavior of the toggle flip flop in terms of its characteristic equation the first style is attractive because it does not require the reader to remember the characteristic equation nonetheless the models are interchangeable and will synthesize to the same hardware circuit test bench module provides stimulus for verifying the functionality of the circuit the sequential circuit is two bit binary counter controlled by input in the output out is enabled when the count reaches binary flip flops section synthesizable hdl models of sequential circuits and are included as outputs in order to check their operation the flip flop input equations and the output equation are evaluated with continuous assignment assign statements having the corresponding boolean expressions the instantiated flip flops use ta and tb as defined by the input equations the second module describes the flip flop the reset input resets the flip flop to with an active low signal the operation of the flip flop is specified by its characteristic equation t the test bench includes both models of the machine the stimulus module provides common inputs to the circuits to simultaneously display their output responses the first initial block provides eight clock cycles with period of ns the second initial block specifies toggling of input in that occurs at the negative edge transition of the clock the result of the

assignment name clock reset x in b figure simulation output of hdl example state reduction and assignment the analysis of sequential circuits starts from circuit diagram and culminates in state table or diagram the design synthesis of sequential circuit starts from set of specifications and culminates in logic diagram design procedures are presented in section two sequential circuits may exhibit the same inputcoutput behavior but have different number of internal states in their state diagram the current section discusses certain properties of sequential circuits that may simplify design by reducing the number of gates and flip flops it uses in general reducing the number of flipflops reduces the cost of circuit state reduction the reduction in the number of flip flops in sequential circuit is referred to as the state reduction problem state reduction algorithms are concerned with procedures for reducing the number of states in state table while keeping the external inputcoutput requirements unchanged since flip flops produce states reduction in the number of states may or may not result in reduction in the number of flip flops an unpredictable effect in reducing the number of flip flops is that sometimes the equivalent circuit with fewer flip flops may require more combinational gates to realize its next state and output logic we will illustrate the state reduction procedure with an example we start with sequential circuit whose specification is given in the state diagram of fig in our example only the inputcoutput sequences are important the internal states are used merely to provide the required sequences for that reason the states marked inside the circles are denoted b g e figure state diagram by letter symbols instead of their binary values this is in contrast to binary counter wherein the binary value sequence of the states themselves is taken as the outputs there are an infinite number of input sequences that may be applied to the circuit each results in unique output sequence as an example consider the input sequence starting from the initial state each input of or produces an output of or and causes the circuit to go to the next state from the state diagram we obtain the output and state sequence for the given input sequence as follows with the circuit in initial state an input of produces an output of and the circuit remains in state with present state and an input of the output is and the next state is with present state and an input of the output is and the next state is continuing this process we find the complete sequence to be as follows state a c e f f a input output in each column we have the present state input value and output value the next state is written on top of the next column it is important to realize that in this circuit the states themselves are of secondary importance because we are interested only in output sequences caused by input sequences now let us assume that we have found sequential circuit whose state diagram has fewer than seven states and suppose we wish to compare this circuit with the circuit whose state diagram is given by fig if identical input sequences are applied to the two circuits and identical outputs occur for all input sequences then the two circuits are said to be equivalent as far as the inputcoutput is concerned and one may be replaced by the other the problem of state reduction is to find ways of reducing the number of states in sequential circuit without altering the inputcoutput relationships section state reduction and assignment we now proceed to reduce the number of states for this example first we need the state table it is more convenient to apply procedures for state reduction with the use of table rather than diagram the state table of the circuit is listed in table and is obtained directly from the state diagram the following algorithm for the state reduction of completely specified state table is given here without proof two states are said to be equivalent if for each member of the set of inputs they give exactly the same output and send the circuit either to the same state or to an equivalent state when two states are equivalent one of them can be removed without altering the inputcoutput relationships now apply this algorithm to table going through the state table we look for two present states that go to the same next state and have the same output for both input combinations states and are two such states they both go to states and and have outputs of and for and respectively therefore states and are equivalent and one of these states can be removed the procedure of removing state and replacing it by its equivalent is demonstrated in table the row with present state is removed and state is replaced by state each time it occurs in the columns headed next state present state now has next states and and outputs and for and respectively the same next states and outputs appear in the row with present state therefore states and are equivalent and state can be removed and replaced by the final reduced table is shown in table the state diagram for the reduced table consists of only five states and is shown in fig this state diagram satisfies the original inputcoutput specifications and will produce the required output sequence for any given input sequence the following list derived from the state diagram of fig is for the input sequence used previously note that the same output sequence results although the state sequence is different state a c e d d a input output table next state output state table present state a b c d a f e a g a table reducing the state table next state output present state a b d a d f a f f table next state output reduced state table present state a b c d a e a in fact this sequence is exactly the same as that obtained for fig if we replace by and by checking each pair of states for equivalency can be done systematically by means of procedure that employs an implication table which consists of squares one for every suspected pair of possible equivalent states by judicious use of the table it is possible to determine all pairs of equivalent states in state table e b figure reduced state diagram section state reduction and assignment the sequential circuit of this example was reduced from seven to five states in general reducing the number of states in state table may result in circuit with less equipment however the fact that state table has been reduced to fewer states does not guarantee saving in the number of flip flops or the number of gates in actual practice designers may skip this step because target devices are rich in resources state assignment in order to design sequential circuit with physical components it is necessary to assign unique coded binary values to the states for circuit with states the codes must contain bits where for example with three bits it is possible to assign codes to eight states denoted by binary numbers through if the state table of table is used we must assign binary values to seven states the remaining state is unused if the state table of table is used only five states need binary assignment and we are left with three unused states unused states are treated as dont care conditions during the design since dont care conditions usually help in obtaining simpler circuit it is more likely but not certain that the circuit with five states will require fewer combinational gates than the one with seven states the simplest way to code five states is to use the first five integers in binary counting order as shown in the first assignment of table another similar assignment is the gray code shown in assignment here only one bit in the code group changes when going from one number to the next this code makes it easier for the boolean functions to be placed in the map for simplification another possible assignment often used in the design of state machines to control data path units is the one hot assignment this configuration uses as many bits as there are states in the circuit at any given time only one bit is equal to while all others are kept at this type of assignment uses one flipflop per state which is not an issue for register rich field programmable gate arrays see chapter one hot encoding usually leads to simpler decoding logic for the next state and output one hot machines can be faster than machines with sequential binary encoding and the silicon area required by the extra flip flops can be offset by the area table three possible binary state assignments assignment assignment assignment state binary gray code one hot b d table reduced state table with binary assignment present state next state output saved by using simpler decoding logic this trade off is not guaranteed so it must be evaluated for given design table is the reduced state table with binary assignment substituted for the letter symbols of the states different assignment will result in state table with different binary values for the states the binary form of the state table is used to derive the nextstate and output forming combinational logic part of the sequential circuit the complexity of the combinational circuit depends on the binary state assignment chosen sometimes the name transition table is used for state table with binary assignment this convention distinguishes it from state table with symbolic names for the states in this book we use the same name for both types of state tables design procedure design procedures or methodologies specify hardware that will implement desired behavior the design effort for small circuits may be manual but industry relies on automated synthesis tools for designing massive integrated circuits the sequential building block used by synthesis tools is the flip flop together with additional logic it can implement the behavior of jk and flip flops in fact designers generally do not concern themselves with the type of flip flop rather their focus is on correctly describing the sequential functionality that is to be implemented by the synthesis tool here we will illustrate manual methods using jk and flip flops the design of clocked sequential circuit starts from set of specifications and culminates in logic diagram or list of boolean functions from which the logic diagram can be obtained in contrast to combinational circuit which is fully specified by truth table sequential circuit requires state table for its specification the first step in the design of sequential circuits is to obtain state table or an equivalent representation such as state synchronous sequential circuit is made up of flip flops and combinational gates the design of the circuit consists of choosing the flip flops and then finding combinational will examine later another important representation of machines behaviorthe algorithmic state machine asm chart section design procedure gate structure that together with the flip flops produces circuit which fulfills the stated specifications the number of flip flops is determined from the number of states needed in the circuit and the choice of state assignment codes the combinational circuit is derived from the state table by evaluating the flip flop input equations and output equations in fact once the type and number of flip flops are determined the design process involves transformation from sequential circuit problem into combinational circuit problem in this way the techniques of combinational circuit design can be applied the procedure for designing synchronous sequential circuits can be summarized by list of recommended steps from the word description and specifications of the desired operation derive state diagram for the circuit reduce the number of states if necessary assign binary values to the states obtain the binary coded state table choose the type of flip flops to be used derive the simplified flip flop input equations and output equations draw the logic diagram the word specification of the circuit behavior usually assumes that the reader is familiar with digital logic terminology it is necessary that the designer use intuition and experience to arrive at the correct interpretation of the circuit specifications because word descriptions may be incomplete and inexact once such specification has been set down and the state diagram obtained it is possible to use known synthesis procedures to complete the design although there are formal procedures for state reduction and assignment steps and they are seldom used by experienced designers steps through in the design can be implemented by exact algorithms and therefore can be automated the part of the design that follows well defined procedure is referred to as synthesis designers using logic synthesis tools software can follow simplified process that develops an hdl description directly from state diagram letting the synthesis tool determine the circuit elements and structure that implement the description the first step is critical part of the process because succeeding steps depend on it we will give one simple example to demonstrate how state diagram is obtained from word specification suppose we wish to design circuit that detects sequence of three or more consecutive in string of bits coming through an input line e the input is serial bit stream the state diagram for this type of circuit is shown in fig it is derived by starting with state the reset state if the input is the circuit stays in but if the input is it goes to state to indicate that was detected if the next input is the change is to state to indicate the arrival of two consecutive but if the input is the state goes back to the third consecutive sends the circuit to state if more are detected the circuit stays in any input sends the circuit back to in this way the circuit stays in as long as there are three or more consecutive received this is moore model sequential circuit since the output is when the circuit is in state and is otherwise figure state diagram for sequence detector synthesis using flip flops once the state diagram has been derived the rest of the design follows straightforward synthesis procedure in fact we can design the circuit by using an hdl description of the state diagram and the proper hdl synthesis tools to obtain synthesized netlist the hdl description of the state diagram will be similar to hdl example in section to design the circuit by hand we need to assign binary codes to the states and list the state table this is done in table the table is derived from the state diagram of fig with sequential binary assignment we choose two flip flops to represent the four states and we label their outputs and there is one input and one output the characteristic equation of the flip flop is t dq which means that the next state values in the state table specify the input condition for the flip flop the flip flop input equations table state table for sequence detector present input next output state state a x b section design procedure bx bx bx a a x da ax bx db ax bx ab figure maps for sequence detector can be obtained directly from the next state columns of and and expressed in sum of minterms form as t da t db a where and are the present state values of flip flops and is the input and da and db are the input equations the minterms for output are obtained from the output column in the state table the boolean equations are simplified by means of the maps plotted in fig the simplified equations are da ax bx db ax bx ab the advantage of designing with flip flops is that the boolean equations describing the inputs to the flip flops can be obtained directly from the state table software tools automatically infer and select the type flip flop from properly written hdl model the schematic of the sequential circuit is drawn in fig excitation tables the design of sequential circuit with flip flops other than the type is complicated by the fact that the input equations for the circuit must be derived indirectly from the state table when type flip flops are employed the input equations are obtained directly from the next state this is not the case for the jk and types of flip flops in order to determine the input equations for these flip flops it is necessary to derive functional relationship between the state table and the input equations the flip flop characteristic tables presented in table provide the value of the next state when the inputs and the present state are known these tables are useful clk b clk clock figure logic diagram of moore type sequence detector for analyzing sequential circuits and for defining the operation of the flip flops during the design process we usually know the transition from the present state to the next state and wish to find the flip flop input conditions that will cause the required transition for this reason we need table that lists the required inputs for given change of state such table is called an excitation table table shows the excitation tables for the two flip flops jk and each table has column for the present state t column for the next state t and column for each input to show how the required transition is achieved there are four possible transitions from the present state to the next state the required input conditions for each of the four transitions are derived from the information available in the characteristic table the symbol in the tables represents dont care condition which means that it does not matter whether the input is or the excitation table for the jk flip flop is shown in part when both present state and next state are the input must remain at and the input can be either or similarly when both present state and next state are the input must remain at section design procedure table flip flop excitation tables t t k t x x jk flip flop flip flop while the input can be or if the flip flop is to have transition from the to the must be equal to since the input sets the flip flop however input may be either or if the condition sets the flip flop as required if and the flip flop is complemented and goes from the to the as required therefore the input is marked with dont care condition for the transition for transition from the to the we must have since the input clears the flip flop however the input may be either or since has no effect and together with complements the flip flop with resultant transition from the to the the excitation table for the flip flop is shown in part from the characteristic table we find that when input the state of the flip flop is complemented and when the state of the flip flop remains unchanged therefore when the state of the flip flop must remain the same the requirement is that when the state of the flip flop has to be complemented must equal synthesis using jk flip flops the manual synthesis procedure for sequential circuits with jk flip flops is the same as with flip flops except that the input equations must be evaluated from the presentstate to the next state transition derived from the excitation table to illustrate the procedure we will synthesize the sequential circuit specified by table in addition to having columns for the present state input and next state as in conventional state table the table shows the flip flop input conditions from which the input equations are derived the flip flop inputs are derived from the state table in conjunction with the excitation table for the jk flip flop for example in the first row of table we have transition for flip flop from in the present state to in the next state in table for the jk flip flop we find that transition of states from present state to next state requires that input be and input be dont care so and are entered in the first row under ja and ka respectively since the first row also shows transition for flip flop from in the present state to in the next state and are inserted into the first row under jb and kb respectively the second row of the table shows transition for flip flop from in the present state to in the next state from the excitation table we find that transition from to requires that be and be dont care so and are copied into table state table and jk flip flop inputs present input next flip flop inputs state state ja ka jb kb b a x x the second row under jb and kb respectively the process is continued for each row in the table and for each flip flop with the input conditions from the excitation table copied into the proper row of the particular flip flop being considered the flip flop inputs in table specify the truth table for the input equations as function of present state present state and input the input equations are simplified in the maps of fig next state values are not used during the simplification bx bx a x x x x x ja bx ka bx b bx bx x x x x jb kb x figure maps for and input equations section design procedure j clk a b clk b clock figure logic diagram for sequential circuit with jk flip flops since the input equations are function of the present state and the input only note the advantage of using jk type flip flops when sequential circuits are designed manually the fact that there are so many dont care entries indicates that the combinational circuit for the input equations is likely to be simpler because dont care minterms usually help in obtaining simpler expressions if there are unused states in the state table there will be additional dont care conditions in the map nonetheless type flip flops are more amenable to an automated design flow the four input equations for the pair of jk flip flops are listed under the maps of fig the logic diagram schematic of the sequential circuit is drawn in fig synthesis using flip flops the procedure for synthesizing circuits using flip flops will be demonstrated by designing binary counter an bit binary counter consists of flip flops that can count in binary from to the state diagram of three bit counter is shown in fig as figure state diagram of three bit binary counter seen from the binary states indicated inside the circles the flip flop outputs repeat the binary count sequence with return to after the directed lines between circles are not marked with input and output values as in other state diagrams remember that state transitions in clocked sequential circuits are initiated by clock edge the flip flops remain in their present states if no clock is applied for that reason the clock does not appear explicitly as an input variable in state diagram or state table from this point of view the state diagram of counter does not have to show input and output values along the directed lines the only input to the circuit is the clock and the outputs are specified by the present state of the flip flops the next state of counter depends entirely on its present state and the state transition occurs every time the clock goes through transition table is the state table for the three bit binary counter the three flip flops are symbolized by and binary counters are constructed most efficiently with flip flops because of their complement property the flip flop excitation for the inputs is derived from the excitation table of the flip flop and by inspection of the state transition of the present state to the next state as an illustration consider the flip flop input entries for row the present state here is and the next state is which is the next count in the sequence comparing these two counts we note that goes from to so is marked with because flip flop must not change when clock occurs also goes from to so is marked with because this flip flop must be complemented in the next clock edge similarly goes from to indicating that it must be complemented so is marked with the last row with present state is compared with the first count which is its next state going from all to all requires that all three flip flops be complemented the flip flop input equations are simplified in the maps of fig note that has in all eight minterms because the least significant bit of the counter is complemented with each count boolean function that includes all minterms defines constant value of the input equations listed under each map specify the combinational part of the counter including these functions with the three flip flops we obtain table state table for three bit counter present state next state flip flop inputs problems figure maps for three bit

every design should include reset signal problems answers to problems marked with appear at the end of the book where appropriate logic design and its related hdl modeling problem are cross referenced note for each problem that requires writing and verifying an hdl model test plan should be written to identify which functional features are to be tested during the simulation and how they will be tested for example reset on the fly could be tested by asserting the reset signal while the simulated machine is in state other than the reset state the test plan is to guide development of test bench that will implement the plan simulate the model using the test bench and verify that the behavior is correct if synthesis tools and an asic cell library are available the verilog descriptions

and counters registers clocked sequential circuit consists of group of flip flops and combinational gates the flip flops are essential because in their absence the circuit reduces to purely combinational circuit provided that there is no feedback among the gates circuit with flip flops is considered sequential circuit even in the absence of combinational gates circuits that include flip flops are usually classified by the function they perform rather than by the name of the sequential circuit two such circuits are registers and counters register is group of flip flops each one of which shares common clock and is capable of storing one bit of information an bit register consists of group of flip flops capable of storing bits of binary information in addition to the flip flops register may have combinational gates that perform certain data processing tasks in its broadest definition register consists of group of flip flops together with gates that affect their operation the flip flops hold the binary information and the gates determine how the information is transferred into the register counter is essentially register that goes through predetermined sequence of binary states the gates in the counter are connected in such way as to produce the prescribed sequence of states although counters are special type of register it is common to differentiate them by giving them different name various types of registers are available commercially the simplest register is one that consists of only flip flops without any gates figure shows such register constructed with four type flip flops to form four bit data storage register the common clock input triggers all flip flops on the positive edge of each pulse and the binary data available at the four inputs are transferred into the register the value of immediately before the clock edge determines the value of after the clock edge the four c d r c d r clock clear figure four bit register outputs can be sampled at any time to obtain the binary information stored in the register the input clear goes to the active low reset input of all four flip flops when this input goes to all flip flops are reset asynchronously the clear input is useful for clearing the register to all prior to its clocked operation the inputs must be maintained section registers at logic e de asserted during normal clocked operation note that depending on the flip flop either clear clear reset or reset can be used to indicate the transfer of the register to an all state register with parallel load registers with parallel load are fundamental building block in digital systems it is important that you have thorough understanding of their behavior synchronous digital systems have master clock generator that supplies continuous train of clock pulses the pulses are applied to all flip flops and registers in the system the master clock acts like drum that supplies constant beat to all parts of the system separate control signal must be used to decide which register operation will execute at each clock pulse the transfer of new information into register is referred to as loading or updating the register if all the bits of the register are loaded simultaneously with common clock pulse we say that the loading is done in parallel clock edge applied to the inputs of the register of fig will load all four inputs in parallel in this configuration if the contents of the register must be left unchanged the inputs must be held constant or the clock must be inhibited from the circuit in the first case the data bus driving the register would be unavailable for other traffic in the second case the clock can be inhibited from reaching the register by controlling the clock input signal with an enabling gate however inserting gates into the clock path is ill advised because it means that logic is performed with clock pulses the insertion of logic gates produces uneven propagation delays between the master clock and the inputs of flip flops to fully synchronize the system we must ensure that all clock pulses arrive at the same time anywhere in the system so that all flip flops trigger simultaneously performing logic with clock pulses inserts variable delays and may cause the system to go out of synchronism for this reason it is advisable to control the operation of the register with the inputs rather than controlling the clock in the inputs of the flip flops this creates the effect of gated clock but without affecting the clock path of the circuit four bit data storage register with load control input that is directed through gates and into the inputs of the flip flops is shown in fig additional gates implement two channel mux whose output drives the input to the register with either the data bus or the output of the register the load input to the register determines the action to be taken with each clock pulse when the load input is the data at the four external inputs are transferred into the register with the next positive edge of the clock when the load input is the outputs of the flip flops are connected to their respective inputs the feedback connection from output to input is necessary because d flip flop does not have no change condition with each clock edge the input determines the next state of the register to leave the output unchanged it is necessary to make the input equal to the present value of the output e the output circulates to the input at each clock pulse the clock pulses are applied to the inputs without interruption the load input determines whether the next pulse will accept new information or leave the information in the register intact the transfer of information from the data inputs or the outputs of the register is done simultaneously with all four bits in response to clock edge load d d d clock figure four bit register with parallel load shift registers register capable of shifting the binary information held in each cell to its neighboring cell in selected direction is called shift register the logical configuration of shift register consists of chain of flip flops in cascade with the output of one flip flop connected to the input of the next flip flop all flip flops receive common clock pulses which activate the shift of data from one stage to the next the simplest possible shift register is one that uses only flip flops as shown in fig the output of given flip flop is connected to the input of the flip flop at its right this shift register is unidirectional left to right each clock pulse shifts the contents of the section shift registers serial si d d so serial input output c c clk figure four bit shift register register one bit position to the right the configuration does not support left shift the serial input determines what goes into the leftmost flip flop during the shift the serial output is taken from the output of the rightmost flip flop sometimes it is necessary to control the shift so that it occurs only with certain pulses but not with others as with the data register discussed in the previous section the clocks signal can be suppressed by gating the clock signal to prevent the register from shifting preferred alternative in high speed circuits is to suppress the clock action rather than gate the clock signal by leaving the clock path unchanged but recirculating the output of each register cell back through two channel mux whose output is connected to the input of the cell when the clock action is not suppressed the other channel of the mux provides datapath to the cell it will be shown later that the shift operation can be controlled through the inputs of the flip flops rather than through the clock input if however the shift register of fig is used the shift can be controlled with an input by connecting the clock through an and gate this is not preferred practice note that the simplified schematics do not show reset signal but such signal is required in practical designs serial transfer the datapath of digital system is said to operate in serial mode when information is transferred and manipulated one bit at time information is transferred one bit at time by shifting the bits out of the source register and into the destination register this type of transfer is in contrast to parallel transfer whereby all the bits of the register are transferred at the same time the serial transfer of information from register to register is done with shift registers as shown in the block diagram of fig the serial output so of register is connected to the serial input si of register to prevent the loss of information stored in the source register the information in register is made to circulate by connecting the serial output to its serial input the initial content of register is shifted out through its serial output and is lost unless it is transferred to third shift register the shift control input determines when and how many times the registers are shifted for illustration here this is done with an and gate that allows clock pulses to pass into the clk terminals only when the shift control is active this practice can be problematic because it may compromise the clock path of the circuit as discussed earlier suppose the shift registers in fig have four bits each then the control unit that supervises the transfer of data must be designed in such way that it enables the shift sia soa sib shift register sob shift register clk clk clock shift control block diagram clock shift control clk timing diagram figure serial transfer from register to register registers through the shift control signal for fixed time of four clock pulses in order to pass an entire word this design is shown in the timing diagram of fig shift control signal is synchronized with the clock and changes value just after the negative edge of the clock the next four clock pulses find the shift control signal in the active state so the output of the and gate connected to the clk inputs produces four pulses and each rising edge of the pulse causes shift in both registers the fourth pulse changes the shift control to and the shift registers are disabled assume that the binary content of before the shift is and that of is the serial transfer from to occurs in four steps as shown in table with the first pulse the rightmost bit of is shifted into the leftmost bit of and is also circulated into the leftmost position of at the same time all bits of and are shifted one position to the right the previous serial output from in the rightmost position is lost and its value changes from to the next three pulses perform identical operations shifting the bits of into one at time after the fourth shift the shift control goes to and registers and both have the value thus the contents of are copied into so that the contents of remain unchanged e the contents of are restored to their original value the difference between the serial and the parallel mode of operation should be apparent from this example in the parallel mode information is available from all bits of register and all bits can be transferred simultaneously during one clock pulse in the serial section shift registers table serial transfer example timing pulse shift register shift register initial value after after after after mode the registers have single serial input and single serial output the information is transferred one bit at time while the registers are shifted in the same direction serial addition operations in digital computers are usually done in parallel because that is faster mode of operation serial operations are slower because datapath operation takes several clock cycles but serial operations have the advantage of requiring fewer hardware components in vlsi circuits they require less silicon area on chip to demonstrate the serial mode of operation we present the design of serial adder the parallel counterpart was presented in section the two binary numbers to be added serially are stored in two shift registers beginning with the least significant pair of bits the circuit adds one pair at time through single full adder fa circuit as shown in fig carry out of the full adder is transferred to d flip flop the output of which is then used as the carry input for the next pair of significant bits the sum bit from the output of the full adder could be transferred into third shift register by shifting the sum into while the bits of are shifted out it is possible to use one register for storing both the augend and the sum bits the serial input of register can be used to transfer new binary number while the addend bits are shifted out during the addition the operation of the serial adder is as follows initially register holds the augend register holds the addend and the carry flip flop is cleared to the outputs so of and provide pair of significant bits for the full adder at and output of the flip flop provides the input carry at the shift control enables both registers and the carry flip flop so at the next clock pulse both registers are shifted once to the right the sum bit from enters the leftmost flip flop of and the output carry is transferred into flip flop the shift control enables the registers for number of clock pulses equal to the number of bits in the registers for each succeeding clock pulse new sum bit is transferred to new carry is transferred to and both registers are shifted once to the right this process continues until the shift control is disabled thus the addition is accomplished by passing each pair of bits together with the previous carry through single full adder circuit and transferring the sum one bit at time into register initially register and the carry flip flop are cleared to and then the first number is added from while is shifted through the full adder second number is transferred shift si so control shift register clk augend s fa serial si so c input shift register addend d clear figure serial adder to it through its serial input the second number is then added to the contents of register while third number is transferred serially into register this can be repeated to perform the addition of two three or more four bit numbers and accumulate their sum in register comparing the serial adder with the parallel adder described in section we note several differences the parallel adder uses registers with parallel load whereas the serial adder uses shift registers the number of full adder circuits in the parallel adder is equal to the number of bits in the binary numbers whereas the serial adder requires only one full adder circuit and carry flip flop excluding the registers the parallel adder is combinational circuit whereas the serial adder is sequential circuit which consists of full adder and flip flop that stores the output carry this design is typical in serial operations because the result of bit time operation may depend not only on the present inputs but also on previous inputs that must be stored in flip flops to show that serial operations can be designed by means of sequential circuit procedure we will redesign the serial adder with the use of state table first we assume that two shift registers are available to store the binary numbers to be added serially the serial outputs from the registers are designated by and the sequential circuit to be designed will not include the shift registers but they will be inserted later to show the complete circuit the sequential circuit proper has the two inputs and that provide pair of significant bits an output that generates the sum bit and flip flop for storing the carry the state table that specifies the sequential circuit is listed in table the present state of is the present value of the carry the present carry in section shift registers table state table for serial adder present state inputs next state output flip flop inputs x q jq kq x x x x is added together with inputs and to produce the sum bit in output the next state of is equal to the output carry note that the state table entries are identical to the entries in full adder truth table except that the input carry is now the present state of and the output carry is now the next state of if d flip flop is used for the circuit reduces to the one shown in fig if jk flip flop is used for it is necessary to determine the values of inputs and by referring to the excitation table table this is done in the last two columns of table the two flip flop input equations and the output equation can be simplified by means of maps to jq xy kq xy y the circuit diagram is shown in fig the circuit consists of three gates and jk flip flop the two shift registers are included in the diagram to show the complete serial adder note that output is function not only of and but also of the present state of the next state of is function of the present state of and of the values of and that come out of the serial outputs of the shift registers universal shift register if the flip flop outputs of shift register are accessible then information entered serially by shifting can be taken out in parallel from the outputs of the flip flops if parallel load capability is added to shift register then data entered in parallel can be taken out in serial fashion by shifting the data stored in the register some shift registers provide the necessary input and output terminals for parallel transfer they may also have both shift right and shift left capabilities the most general shift register has the following capabilities clear control to clear the register to clock input to synchronize the operations cosnhtirftol sshi ift registersao s clk serial si so input shift register j k clear figure second form of serial adder shift right control to enable the shift right operation and the serial input and output lines associated with the shift right shift left control to enable the shift left operation and the serial input and output lines associated with the shift left parallel load control to enable parallel transfer and the input lines associated with the parallel transfer parallel output lines control state that leaves the information in the register unchanged in response to the clock other shift registers may have only some of the preceding functions with at least one shift operation register capable of shifting in one direction only is unidirectional shift register one that can shift in both directions is bidirectional shift register if the register has both shifts and parallel load capabilities it is referred to as universal shift register the block diagram symbol and the circuit diagram of four bit universal shift register that has all the capabilities just listed are shown in fig the circuit consists of four flip flops and four multiplexers the four multiplexers have two common selection inputs and input in each multiplexer is selected when input is selected when and similarly for the other two inputs the selection inputs control the mode of operation of the register according to the function entries in table the present value of the register is applied to the inputs of the flip flops this condition forms path from the output of each flip flop into the input of the same flip flop so that the output recirculates to the input in this mode of operation the next clock edge transfers into each flip flop the binary value it held previously and no change of state occurs section shift registers par msb in shift register lsb in clk clear i par parallel outputs clear q q clk c c d d y y mux mux mux mux serial serial input for input for shift right shift left parallel inputs figure four bit universal shift register table function table for the register of fig mode control register operation no change shift right shift left parallel load when terminal of the multiplexer inputs has path to the inputs of the flip flops this causes shift right operation with the serial input transferred into flip flop when shift left operation results with the other serial input going into flip flop finally when the binary information on the parallel input lines is transferred into the register simultaneously during the next clock edge note that data enters msb in for shift right operation and enters lsb in for shift left operation clear is an active low signal that clears all of the flip flops shift registers are often used to interface digital systems situated remotely from each other for example suppose it is necessary to transmit an bit quantity between two points if the distance is far it will be expensive to use lines to transmit the bits in parallel it is more economical to use single line and transmit the information serially one bit at time the transmitter accepts the bit data in parallel into shift register and then transmits the data serially along the common line the receiver accepts the data serially into shift register when all bits are received they can be taken from the outputs of the register in parallel thus the transmitter performs parallel to serial conversion of data and the receiver does serial to parallel conversion ripple counters register that goes through prescribed sequence of states upon the application of input pulses is called counter the input pulses may be clock pulses or they may originate from some external source and may occur at fixed interval of time or at random the sequence of states may follow the binary number sequence or any other sequence of states counter that follows the binary number sequence is called binary counter an bit binary counter consists of flip flops and can count in binary from through counters are available in two categories ripple counters and synchronous counters in ripple counter flip flop output transition serves as source for triggering other flip flops in other words the input of some or all flip flops are triggered not by the common clock pulses but rather by the transition that occurs in other flip flop outputs in synchronous counter the inputs of all flip flops receive the common clock synchronous counters are presented in the next two sections here we present the binary and bcd ripple counters and explain their operation section ripple counters binary ripple counter binary ripple counter consists of series connection of complementing flip flops with the output of each flip flop connected to the input of the next higher order flip flop the flip flop holding the least significant bit receives the incoming count pulses complementing flip flop can be obtained from jk flip flop with the and inputs tied together or from t flip flop third possibility is to use d flip flop with the complement output connected to the input in this way the input is always the complement of the present state and the next clock pulse will cause the flip flop to complement the logic diagram of two bit binary ripple counters is shown in fig the counter is constructed with complementing flip flops of the type in part and type in part the output of each flip flop is connected to the input of the next flip flop in sequence the flip flop holding the least significant bit receives the incoming count pulses the inputs of all the flip flops in are connected to permanent logic making each flip flop complement if the signal in its input goes through negative transition the bubble in front of the dynamic indicator symbol next to indicates that the flip flops respond to the negative edge transition of the input the negative transition occurs when the output of the previous flip flop to which is connected goes from to to understand the operation of the four bit binary ripple counter refer to the first nine binary numbers listed in table the count starts with binary and increments by with each count pulse input after the count of the counter goes back to to repeat the count the least significant bit is complemented with each count pulse input every time that goes from to it complements every time that goes from to it complements every time that goes from to it complements and so on for any other higher order bits of ripple counter for example consider the transition from count to is complemented with the count pulse since goes from to it triggers and complements it as result goes from to which in turn complements changing it from to does not trigger because produces positive transition and the flip flop responds only to negative transitions thus the count from to is achieved by changing the bits one at time so the table binary count sequence a a d count r count cr d cr cr d cr cr d cr cr logic reset reset with flip flops with flip flops figure four bit binary ripple counter section ripple counters count goes from to then to and finally to the flip flops change one at time in succession and the signal propagates through the counter in ripple fashion from one stage to the next binary counter with reverse count is called binary countdown counter in countdown counter the binary count is decremented by with every input count pulse the count of four bit countdown counter starts from binary and continues to binary counts and then back to list of the count sequence of binary countdown counter shows that the least significant bit is complemented with every count pulse any other bit in the sequence is complemented if its previous least significant bit goes from to therefore the diagram of binary countdown counter looks the same as the binary ripple counter in fig provided that all flip flops trigger on the positive edge of the clock the bubble in the inputs must be absent if negative edge triggered flip flops are used then the input of each flip flop must be connected to the complemented output of the previous flip flop then when the true output goes from to the complement will go from to and complement the next flip flop as required bcd ripple counter decimal counter follows sequence of states and returns to after the count of such counter must have at least four flip flops to represent each decimal digit since decimal digit is represented by binary code with at least four bits the sequence of states in decimal counter is dictated by the binary code used to represent decimal digit if bcd is used the sequence of states is as shown in the state diagram of fig decimal counter is similar to binary counter except that the state after the code for decimal digit is the code for decimal digit the logic diagram of bcd ripple counter using jk flip flops is shown in fig the four outputs are designated by the letter symbol with numeric subscript equal to the binary weight of the corresponding bit in the bcd code note that the output of is applied to the inputs of both and and the output of is applied to the input of the and inputs are connected either to permanent signal or to outputs of other flip flops ripple counter is an asynchronous sequential circuit signals that affect the flip flop transition depend on the way they change from to the operation of the counter can figure state diagram of decimal bcd counter count k c j k c logic figure bcd ripple counter be explained by list of conditions for flip flop transitions these conditions are derived from the logic diagram and from knowledge of how jk flip flop operates remember that when the input goes from to the flip flop is set if is cleared if is complemented if and is left unchanged if section synchronous counters bcd bcd bcd count counter counter counter pulses digit digit digit figure block diagram of three decade decimal bcd counter to verify that these conditions result in the sequence required by bcd ripple counter it is necessary to verify that the flip flop transitions indeed follow sequence of states as specified by the state diagram of fig changes state after each clock pulse complements every time goes from to as long as when becomes remains at complements every time goes from to remains at as long as or is when both and become complements when goes from to is cleared on the next transition of the bcd counter of fig is decade counter since it counts from to to count in decimal from to we need two decade counter to count from to we need three decade counter multiple decade counters can be constructed by connecting bcd counters in cascade one for each decade three decade counter is shown in fig the inputs to the second and third decades come from of the previous decade when in one decade goes from to it triggers the count for the next higher order decade while its own decade goes from to synchronous counters synchronous counters are different from ripple counters in that clock pulses are applied to the inputs of all flip flops common clock triggers all flip flops simultaneously rather than one at time in succession as in ripple counter the decision whether flip flop is to be complemented is determined from the values of the data inputs such as or and at the time of the clock edge if or the flip flop does not change state if or the flip flop complements the design procedure for synchronous counters was presented in section and the design of three bit binary counter was carried out in conjunction with fig in this section we present some typical synchronous counters and explain their operation binary counter the design of synchronous binary counter is so simple that there is no need to go through sequential logic design process in synchronous binary counter the flip flop in the least significant position is complemented with every pulse flip flop in any other position is complemented when all the bits in the lower significant positions are equal to for example if the present state of four bit counter is the next count is is always complemented is complemented because the present state of is complemented because the present state of however is not complemented because the present state of which does not give an all condition synchronous binary counters have regular pattern and can be constructed with complementing flip flops and gates the regular pattern can be seen from the four bit counter depicted in fig the inputs of all flip flops are connected to common clock the counter is enabled by count enable if the enable input is all and inputs are equal to and the clock does not change the state of the counter the first stage has its and equal to if the counter is enabled the other and inputs are equal to if all previous least significant stages are equal to and the count is enabled the chain of and gates generates the required logic for the and inputs in each stage the counter can be extended to any number of stages with each stage having an additional flip flop and an and gate that gives an output of if all previous flip flop outputs are note that the flip flops trigger on the positive edge of the clock the polarity of the clock is not essential here but it is with the ripple counter the synchronous counter can be triggered with either the positive or the negative clock edge the complementing flip flops in binary counter can be of either the jk type the type or the type with xor gates the equivalency of the three types is indicated in fig upcdown binary counter synchronous countdown binary counter goes through the binary states in reverse order from down to and back to to repeat the count it is possible to design countdown counter in the usual manner but the result is predictable by inspection of the downward binary count the bit in the least significant position is complemented with each pulse bit in any other position is complemented if all lower significant bits are equal to for example the next state after the present state of is the least significant bit is always complemented the second significant bit is complemented because the first bit is the third significant bit is complemented because the first two bits are equal to but the fourth bit does not change because not all lower significant bits are equal to countdown binary counter can be constructed as shown in fig except that the inputs to the and gates must come from the complemented outputs instead of the normal outputs of the previous flip flops the two operations can be combined in one circuit to form counter capable of counting either up or down the circuit of an upcdown binary counter using flip flops is shown in fig it has an up control input and down control input when the up input is the circuit counts up since the inputs receive their signals from the values of the previous normal outputs of the flip flops when the down input is and the up input is the circuit counts down since the complemented outputs of the previous flip flops are applied to the inputs when the up and down inputs are both the circuit does not change state and remains section synchronous counters c count enable j k c j to next stage clk figure four bit synchronous binary counter up down t t t clk figure four bit upcdown binary counter section synchronous counters in the same count when the up and down inputs are both the circuit counts up this set of conditions ensures that only one operation is performed at any given time note that the up input has priority over the down input bcd counter bcd counter counts in binary coded decimal from to and back to because of the return to after count of bcd counter does not have regular pattern unlike straight binary count to derive the circuit of bcd synchronous counter it is necessary to go through sequential circuit design procedure the state table of bcd counter is listed in table the input conditions for the flip flops are obtained from the present and next state conditions also shown in the table is an output which is equal to when the present state is in this way can enable the count of the next higher significant decade while the same pulse switches the present decade from to the flip flop input equations can be simplified by means of maps the unused states for minterms to are taken as dont care terms the simplified functions are the circuit can easily be drawn with four flip flops five and gates and one or gate synchronous bcd counters can be cascaded to form counter for decimal numbers of any length the cascading is done as in fig except that output must be connected to the count input of the next higher significant decade table state table for bcd counter present state next state output flip flop inputs q y binary counter with parallel load counters employed in digital systems quite often require parallel load capability for transferring an initial binary number into the counter prior to the count operation figure shows the top level block diagram symbol and the logic diagram of four bit register that has parallel load capability and can operate as counter when equal to the input load control disables the count operation and causes transfer of data from the four data inputs into the four flip flops if both control inputs are clock pulses do not change the state of the register the carry output becomes if all the flip flops are equal to while the count input is enabled this is the condition for complementing the flip flop that holds the next significant bit the carry output is useful for expanding the counter to more than four bits the speed of the counter is increased when the carry is generated directly from the outputs of all four flip flops because the delay to generate the carry bit is reduced in going from state to only one gate delay occurs whereas four gate delays occur in the and gate chain shown in fig similarly each flip flop is associated with an and gate that receives all previous flip flop outputs directly instead of connecting the and gates in chain the operation of the counter is summarized in table the four control inputs clear clk load and countdetermine the next state the clear input is asynchronous and when equal to causes the counter to be cleared regardless of the presence of clock pulses or other inputs this relationship is indicated in the table by the entries which symbolize dont care conditions for the other inputs the clear input must be in the state for all other operations with the load and count inputs both at the outputs do not change even when clock pulses are applied load input of causes transfer from inputs into the register during positive edge of clk the input data are loaded into the register regardless of the value of the count input because the count input is inhibited when the load input is enabled the load input must be for the count input to control the operation of the counter counter with parallel load can be used to generate any desired count sequence figure shows two ways in which counter with parallel load is used to generate the bcd count in each case the count control is set to to enable the count through the clk input also recall that the load control inhibits the count and that the clear operation is independent of other control inputs the and gate in fig detects the occurrence of state the counter is initially cleared to and then the clear and count inputs are set to so the counter is active at all times as long as the output of the and gate is each positive edge clock table function table for the counter of fig clear clk load count function x clear to x load inputs count next binary state no change section synchronous counters count load data in binary counter count clear clk out count load c j k c clear clk figure four bit binary counter with parallel load c out load count clear count clear load counter clk counter clk of fig of fig inputs inputs have no effect using the load input using the clear input figure two ways to achieve bcd counter using counter with parallel load increments the counter by when the output reaches the count of both and become making the output of the and gate equal to this condition activates the load input therefore on the next clock edge the register does not count but is loaded from its four inputs since all four inputs are connected to logic an all value is loaded into the register following the count of thus the circuit goes through the count from through and back to as is required in bcd counter in fig the nand gate detects the count of but as soon as this count occurs the register is cleared the count has no chance of staying on for any appreciable time because the register goes immediately to momentary spike occurs in output as the count goes from to and immediately to the spike may be undesirable and for that reason this configuration is not recommended if the counter has synchronous clear input it is possible to clear the counter with the clock after an occurrence of the count other counters counters can be designed to generate any desired sequence of states divide by counter also known as modulo counter is counter that goes through repeated sequence of states the sequence may follow the binary count or may be any other arbitrary sequence counters are used to generate timing signals to control the sequence of operations in digital system counters can also be constructed by means of shift registers in this section we present few examples of nonbinary counters counter with unused states circuit with flip flops has binary states there are occasions when sequential circuit uses fewer than this maximum possible number of states states that are not used section other counters in specifying the sequential circuit are not listed in the state table in simplifying the input equations the unused states may be treated as dont care conditions or may be assigned specific next states it is important to realize that once the circuit is designed and constructed outside interference during its operation may cause the circuit to enter one of the unused states in that case it is necessary to ensure that the circuit eventually goes into one of the valid states so that it can resume normal operation otherwise if the sequential circuit circulates among unused states there will be no way to bring it back to its intended sequence of state transitions if the unused states are treated as dont care conditions then once the circuit is designed it must be investigated to determine the effect of the unused states the next state from an unused state can be determined from the analysis of the circuit after it is designed as an illustration consider the counter specified in table the count has repeated sequence of six states with flip flops and repeating the binary count and flip flop alternating between and every three counts the count sequence of the counter is not straight binary and two states and are not included in the count the choice of jk flip flops results in the flip flop input conditions listed in the table inputs kb and kc have only and xs in their columns so these inputs are always equal to the other flip flop input equations can be simplified by using minterms and as dont care conditions the simplified equations are ja ka jb kb jc kc the logic diagram of the counter is shown in fig since there are two unused states we analyze the circuit to determine their effect if the circuit happens to be in state because of an error signal the circuit goes to state after the application of clock pulse this action may be determined from an inspection of the logic diagram by noting that when the next clock edge complements and clears to and when the next clock edge complements in similar manner we can evaluate the next state from present state to be table state table for counter present state next state flip flop inputs ab a c ja ka jb kb jc kc x x xx xx x xx a k b k c logic clock logic circuit diagram state transition diagram figure counter with unused states the state diagram including the effect of the unused states is shown in fig if the circuit ever goes to one of the unused states because of outside interference the next count pulse transfers it to one of the valid states and the circuit continues to count correctly thus the counter is self correcting in self correcting counter if the counter happens to be in one of the unused states it eventually reaches the normal count sequence after one or more clock pulses an alternative design could use additional logic to direct every unused state to specific next state ring counter timing signals that control the sequence of operations in digital system can be generated by shift register or by counter with decoder ring counter is circular shift register with only one flip flop being set at any particular time all others are cleared the single bit is shifted from one flip flop to the next to produce the sequence of timing signals figure shows four bit shift register connected as ring counter the initial value of the register is and requires preset clear flip flops the single bit is section other counters shift right ring counter initial value clk sequence of four timing signals decoder count counter enable counter and decoder figure generation of timing signals shifted right with every clock pulse and circulates back from to each flip flop is in the state once every four clock cycles and produces one of the four timing signals shown in fig each output becomes after the negative edge transition of clock pulse and remains during the next clock cycle for an alternative design the timing signals can be generated by two bit counter that goes through four distinct states the decoder shown in fig decodes the four states of the counter and generates the required sequence of timing signals to generate timing signals we need either shift register with flip flops or an bit binary counter together with an to line decoder for example timing signals can be generated with bit shift register connected as ring counter or with bit binary counter and to line decoder in the first case we need flip flops in the second we need flip flops and four input and gates for the decoder it is also possible to generate the timing signals with combination of shift register and decoder that way the number of flip flops is less than that in ring counter and the decoder requires only two input gates this combination is called johnson counter johnson counter k bit ring counter circulates single bit among the flip flops to provide distinguishable states the number of states can be doubled if the shift register is connected as switch tail ring counter switch tail ring counter is circular shift register with the complemented output of the last flip flop connected to the input of the first flip flop figure shows such shift register the circular connection is made from the a b c e c c b e clk four stage switch tail ring counter sequence flip flop outputs and gate required number abce for output ae ab bc ce ae ab bc ce count sequence and required decoding figure construction of johnson counter section hdl for registers and counters complemented output of the rightmost flip flop to the input of the leftmost flip flop the register shifts its contents once to the right with every clock pulse and at the same time the complemented value of the flip flop is transferred into the flip flop starting from cleared state the switch tail ring counter goes through sequence of eight states as listed in fig in general k bit switch tail ring counter will go through sequence of states starting from all each shift operation inserts from the left until the register is filled with all in the next sequences are inserted from the left until the register is again filled with all johnson counter is k bit switch tail ring counter with decoding gates to provide outputs for timing signals the decoding gates are not shown in fig but are specified in the last column of the table the eight and gates listed in the table when connected to the circuit will complete the construction of the johnson counter since each gate is enabled during one particular state sequence the outputs of the gates generate eight timing signals in succession the decoding of k bit switch tail ring counter to obtain timing signals follows regular pattern the all state is decoded by taking the complement of the two extreme flip flop outputs the all state is decoded by taking the normal outputs of the two extreme flip flops all other states are decoded from an adjacent or pattern in the sequence for example sequence has an adjacent pattern in flip flops and the decoded output is then obtained by taking the complement of and the normal output of or bc one disadvantage of the circuit in fig is that if it finds itself in an unused state it will persist in moving from one invalid state to another and never find its way to valid state the difficulty can be corrected by modifying the circuit to avoid this undesirable condition one correcting procedure is to disconnect the output from flip flop that goes to the input of flip flop and instead enable the input of flip flop by the function dc b where dc is the flip flop input equation for the input of flip flop johnson counters can be constructed for any number of timing sequences the number of flip flops needed is one half the number of timing signals the number of decoding gates is equal to the number of timing signals and only two input gates are needed hdl for registers and counters registers and counters can be described in verilog at either the behavioral or the structural level behavioral modeling describes only the operations of the register as prescribed by function table without preconceived structure structural level description shows the circuit in terms of collection of components such as gates flip flops and multiplexers the various components are instantiated to form hierarchical description of the design similar to representation of multilevel logic diagram the examples in this section will illustrate both types of descriptions both are useful when machine is complex hierarchical description creates physical partition of the machine into simpler and more easily described units shift register the universal shift register presented in section is bidirectional shift register with parallel load the four clocked operations that are performed with the register are specified in table the register also can be cleared asynchronously our chosen name for behavioral description of the four bit universal shift register shown in fig the name signifies the behavioral model of the internal detail of the top level block diagram symbol and distinguishes that model from structural one the behavioral model is presented in hdl example and the structural model is given in hdl example the top level block diagram symbol in fig indicates that the four bit universal shift register has two selection inputs two serial inputs shift left shift right for controlling the shift register two serial datapath inputs msb in and lsb in four bit parallel input par and four bit parallel output par the elements of vector correspond to the bits in fig and similarly for the always block describes the five operations that can be performed with the register the clear input clears the register asynchronously with an active low signal clear must be high for the register to respond to the positive edge of the clock the four clocked operations of the register are determined from the values of the two select inputs in the case statement and are concatenated into two bit vector and are used as the expression argument of the case statement the shifting operation is specified by the concatenation of the serial input and three bits of the register for example the statement par msb in par specifies concatenation of the serial data input for right shift operation msb in with bits of the output data bus reference to contiguous range of bits within vector is referred to as part select the four bit result of the concatenation is transferred to register par when the clock pulse triggers the operation this transfer produces shift right operation and updates the register with new information the shift operation overwrites the contents of with the contents of note that only the functionality of the circuit has been described irrespective of any particular hardware synthesis tool would create netlist of asic cells to implement the shift register in the structure of fig hdl example universal shift register behavioral model behavioral description of universal shift register fig and table module output reg

by an assignment statement consider the following alternative case statement for the shift register model case no change par par shift right par msb in par shift left par par lsb in parallel load of input par par endcase without the case item the case statement would not find match between and the case items so register par would be left unchanged structural model of the universal shift register can be described by referring to the logic diagram of fig diagram shows that the register has four multiplexers and four flip flops mux and flip flop together are modeled as stage of the shift register the stage is structural model too with an instantiation and interconnection of module for mux and another for d flip flop for simplicity the lowest level modules of the structure are behavioral models of the multiplexer and flip flop attention must be paid to the details of connecting the stages correctly the structural description of the register is shown in hdl example the top level module declares the inputs and outputs and then instantiates four copies of stage of the register the four instantiations specify the interconnections between the four stages and provide the detailed construction of the register as specified in the logic diagram the behavioral description of the flip flop uses single edge sensitive cyclic behavior an always block the assignment statements use the nonblocking assignment operator the model of the mux employs single level sensitive behavior and the assignments use the blocking assignment operator hdl example universal shift register

to illustrate the different styles for modeling digital circuit simulation should verify that the models have the same functionality in practice designer develops only the behavioral model which is then synthesized the function of the synthesized circuit can be compared with the behavioral description from which it was compiled eliminating the need for the designer to develop structural model produces huge improvement in the efficiency of the design process synchronous counter hdl example presents behavioral model of the synchronous counter with parallel load from fig count load clk and clear are inputs that determine the operation of the counter according to the function specified in table the counter has four data inputs four data outputs and carry output the internal data lines are bundled as in the behavioral model likewise the register that holds the bits of the count is it is good practice to have identifiers in the hdl model of circuit correspond exactly to those in the documentation of the model that is not always feasible however if the circuit level identifiers are those found in handbook for they are often short and cryptic and do not exploit the text that is available with an hdl the top level block diagram symbol in fig serves as an interface between the names used in circuit diagram and the expressive names that can be used in the hdl model the carry output out is generated by combinational circuit and is specified with an assign statement out the count reaches and the counter is in the count state thus out count load and otherwise out the always

structural description of ripple counter is shown in hdl example the first module instantiates four internally complementing flip flops defined in the second module as comp flip flop clk reset the clock input clk of the first flip flop is connected to the external control signal count count replaces clk in the port list of instance the clock input of the second flip flop is connected to the output of the first replaces clk in instance similarly the clock of each of the other flip flops is connected to the output of the previous flip flop in this way the flip flops are chained together to create ripple counter as shown in fig the second module describes complementing flip flop with delay the circuit of complementing flip flop is constructed by connecting the complement output to the input reset input is included with the flip flop in order to be able to initialize the counter otherwise the simulator would assign the unknown value to the output of the flip flop and produce useless results the flip flop is assigned delay of two time units from the time that the clock is applied to the time that the flip flop complements its output the delay is specified by the statement notice that the delay operator is placed to the right of the nonblocking assignment operator this form of delay called intra assignment delay has the effect of postponing the assignment of the complemented value of to the effect of modeling the delay will be apparent in the simulation results this style of modeling might be useful in simulation but it is to be avoided when the model is to be synthesized the results of synthesis depend on the asic cell library that is accessed by the tool not on any propagation delays that might appear within the model that is to be synthesized section hdl for

signal count goes negative every ns is complemented with each negative edge of count but is delayed by ns each flip flop is complemented when its previous flip flop goes from to ns all four flip flops complement because the counter goes from to each output is delayed by ns and because of that goes from to at ns and from to at ns notice how the propagation delays accumulate to the last bit of the counter resulting in very slow counter action this limits the practical utility of the counter ns ns ns ns reset count ns ns from to ns ns ns ns ns ns reset count from to ns figure simulation output of hdl example problems problems answers to problems marked with appear at the end of the book where appropriate logic design and its related hdl modeling problem are cross referenced note for each problem that requires writing and verifying verilog description test plan is to be written to identify which functional features are to be tested during the simulation and how they will be tested for example reset on the fly could be tested by asserting the reset signal while the simulated machine is in state other than the reset state the test plan is to guide the development of test bench that will implement the plan simulate the model using the test bench and verify that the behavior is correct if synthesis tools and an asic cell library or field programmable gate array fpga tool suite are

counter johnson counter ring counter sequence detector synchronous counter switch tail ring counter upcdown counter memory and programmable logic introduction memory unit is device to which binary information is transferred for storage and from which information is retrieved when needed for processing when data processing takes place information from memory is transferred to selected registers in the processing unit intermediate and final results obtained in the processing unit are transferred back to be stored in memory binary information received from an input device is stored in memory and information transferred to an output device is taken from memory memory unit is collection of cells capable of storing large quantity of binary information there are two types of memories that are used in digital systems random access memory ram and read only memory rom ram stores new information for later use the process of storing new information into memory is referred to as memory write operation the process of transferring the stored information out of memory is referred to as memory read operation ram can perform both write and read operations rom can perform only the read operation this means that suitable binary information is already stored inside memory and can be retrieved or read at any time however that information cannot be altered by writing rom is programmable logic device pld the binary information that is stored within such device is specified in some fashion and then embedded within the hardware in process is referred to as programming the device the word programming here refers to hardware procedure which specifies the bits that are inserted into the hardware configuration of the device rom is one example of pld other such units are the programmable logic array pla programmable array logic pal and the field programmable gate array fpga pld is an integrated circuit with internal logic gates connected through electronic conventional symbol array logic symbol figure conventional and array logic diagrams for or gate paths that behave similarly to fuses in the original state of the device all the fuses are intact programming the device involves blowing those fuses along the paths that must be removed in order to obtain the particular configuration of the desired logic function in this chapter we introduce the configuration of plds and indicate procedures for their use in the design of digital systems we also present cmos fpgas which are configured by downloading stream of bits into the device to configure transmission gates to establish the internal connectivity required by specified logic function combinational or sequential typical pld may have hundreds to millions of gates interconnected through hundreds to thousands of internal paths in order to show the internal logic diagram of such device in concise form it is necessary to employ special gate symbology applicable to array logic figure shows the conventional and array logic symbols for multiple input or gate instead of having multiple input lines into the gate we draw single line entering the gate the input lines are drawn perpendicular to this single line and are connected to the gate through internal fuses in similar fashion we can draw the array logic for an and gate this type of graphical representation for the inputs of gates will be used throughout the chapter in array logic diagrams random access memory memory unit is collection of storage cells together with associated circuits needed to transfer information into and out of device the architecture of memory is such that information can be selectively retrieved from any of its internal locations the time it takes to transfer information to or from any desired random location is always the samehence the name random access memory abbreviated ram in contrast the time required to retrieve information that is stored on magnetic tape depends on the location of the data memory unit stores binary information in groups of bits called words word in memory is an entity of bits that move in and out of storage as unit memory word is group of and and may represent number an instruction one or more alphanumeric characters or any other binary coded information group of bits is called byte most computer memories use words that are multiples of bits in length thus bit word contains two bytes and bit word is made up of four bytes the capacity of memory unit is usually stated as the total number of bytes that the unit can store section random access memory address lines data input lines read write memory unit words figure block diagram of memory unit bit per word data output lines communication between memory and its environment is achieved through data input and output lines address selection lines and control lines that specify the direction of transfer block diagram of memory unit is shown in fig the data input lines provide the information to be stored in memory and the data output lines supply the information coming out of memory the address lines specify the particular word chosen among the many available the two control inputs specify the direction of transfer desired the write input causes binary data to be transferred into the memory and the read input causes binary data to be transferred out of memory the memory unit is specified by the number of words it contains and the number of bits in each word the address lines select one particular word each word in memory is assigned an identification number called an address starting from up to where is the number of address lines the selection of specific word inside memory is done by applying the bit address to the address lines an internal decoder accepts this address and opens the paths needed to select the word specified memories vary greatly in size and may range from words requiring an address of bits to words requiring address bits it is customary to refer to the number of words or bytes in memory with one of the letters kilo mega and giga is equal to is equal to and is equal to thus and consider for example memory unit with capacity of words of bits each since and bits constitute two bytes we can say that the memory can accommodate bytes figure shows possible contents of the first three and the last three words of this memory each word contains bits that can be divided into two bytes the words are recognized by their decimal address from to the equivalent binary address consists of bits the first address is specified with ten the last address is specified with ten because in binary is equal to word in memory is selected by its binary address when word is read or written the memory operates on all bits as single unit the memory of fig has bits in the address and bits in each word as another example memory will have bits in the address since and each word will consist of bits the number of address bits needed in chapter memory and programmable logic memory address binary decimal memory content figure contents of memory memory is dependent on the total number of words that can be stored in the memory and is independent of the number of bits in each word the number of bits in the address is determined from the relationship where is the total number of words and is the number of address bits needed to satisfy the relationship write and read operations the two operations that ram can perform are the write and read operations as alluded to earlier the write signal specifies transfer in operation and the read signal specifies transfer out operation on accepting one of these control signals the internal circuits inside the memory provide the desired operation the steps that must be taken for the purpose of transferring new word to be stored into memory are as follows apply the binary address of the desired word to the address lines apply the data bits that must be stored in memory to the data input lines activate the write input the memory unit will then take the bits from the input data lines and store them in the word specified by the address lines the steps that must be taken for the purpose of transferring stored word out of memory are as follows apply the binary address of the desired word to the address lines activate the read input section random access memory table control inputs to memory chip memory enable read write memory operation none write to selected word read from selected word the memory unit will then take the bits from the word that has been selected by the address and apply them to the output data lines the contents of the selected word do not change after the read operation e the word operation is nondestructive commercial memory components available in integrated circuit chips sometimes provide the two control inputs for reading and writing in somewhat different configuration instead of having separate read and write inputs to control the two operations most integrated circuits provide two other control inputs one input selects the unit and the other determines the operation the memory operations that result from these control inputs are specified in table the memory enable sometimes called the chip select is used to enable the particular memory chip in multichip implementation of large memory when the memory enable is inactive the memory chip is not selected and no operation is performed when the memory enable input is active the read write input determines the operation to be performed memory description in hdl memory is modeled in the verilog hardware description language hdl by an array of registers it is declared with reg keyword using two dimensional array the first number in the array specifies the number of bits in word the word length and the second gives the number of words in memory memory depth for example memory of words with bits per word is declared as memword this statement describes two dimensional array of registers each containing bits the second array range in the declaration of memword specifies the total number of words in memory and is equivalent to the address of the memory for example refers to the bit memory word at address the operation of memory unit is illustrated in hdl example the memory has words of four bits each there are two control inputs enable and readwrite the datain and dataout lines have four bits each the input address must have six bits since the memory is declared as two dimensional array of registers with mem used as an identifier that can be referenced with an index to access any of the words memory operation requires that the enable input be active the readwrite input determines the type of operation if readwrite is the memory performs read operation symbolized by the statement dataout mem address execution of this statement causes transfer of four bits from the selected memory word specified by address onto the dataout lines if readwrite is the memory performs write operation symbolized by the statement mem address datain execution of this statement causes transfer from the four bit datain lines into the memory word selected by address when enable is equal to the memory is disabled and the outputs are assumed to be in high impedance state indicated by the symbol thus the memory has three state outputs hdl example read and write operations of memory memory size is words of four bits each module memory enable readwrite address datain dataout input enable readwrite input datain input address output dataout reg dataout reg mem memory always enable or readwrite if enable if readwrite dataout mem address read else mem address datain write else dataout high impedance state endmodule timing waveforms the operation of the memory unit is controlled by an external device such as central processing unit cpu the cpu is usually synchronized by its own clock the memory however does not employ an internal clock instead its read and write operations are specified by control inputs the access time of memory is the time required to select word and read it the cycle time of memory is the time required to complete write operation the cpu must provide the memory control signals in such way as to synchronize its internal clocked operations with the read and write operations of memory this means that the access time and cycle time of the memory must be within time equal to fixed number of cpu clock cycles suppose as an example that cpu operates with clock frequency of mhz giving period of ns for one clock cycle suppose also that the cpu communicates with memory whose access time and cycle time do not exceed ns this means that the section random access memory clock nsec memory address address valid memory initiate writing latched enable data valid read write cycle write data input nsec clock address valid memory address memory initiate read enable read write data data valid output read cycle figure memory cycle timing waveforms write cycle terminates the storage of the selected word within ns interval and that the read cycle provides the output data of the selected word within ns or less the two numbers are not always the same since the period of the cpu cycle is ns it will be necessary to devote at least two and half and possibly three clock cycles for each memory request the memory timing shown in fig is for cpu with mhz clock and memory with ns maximum cycle time the write cycle in part shows three ns cycles t and for write operation the cpu must provide the address and input data to the memory this is done at the beginning of the two lines that cross each other in the address and data waveforms designate possible change in value of the multiple lines the memory enable and the read write signals must be activated after the signals in the address lines are stable in order to avoid destroying data in other memory words the memory enable signal switches to the high level and the read write signal switches to the low level to indicate write operation the two control signals must stay active for at least ns the address and data signals must remain stable for short time after the control signals are deactivated at the completion of the third clock cycle the memory write operation is completed and the cpu can access the memory again with the next cycle the read cycle shown in fig has an address for the memory provided by the cpu the memory enable and read write signals must be in their high level for read operation the memory places the data of the word selected by the address into the output data lines within ns interval or less from the time that the memory enable is activated the cpu can transfer the data into one of its internal registers during the negative transition of the next cycle is available for another memory request types of memories the mode of access of memory system is determined by the type of components used in random access memory the word locations may be thought of as being separated in space each word occupying one particular location in sequential access memory the information stored in some medium is not immediately accessible but is available only at certain intervals of time magnetic disk or tape unit is of this type each memory location passes the read and write heads in turn but information is read out only when the requested word has been reached in random access memory the access time is always the same regardless of the particular location of the word in sequential access memory the time it takes to access word depends on the position of the word with respect to the position of the read head therefore the access time is variable integrated circuit ram units are available in two operating modes static and dynamic static ram sram consists essentially of internal latches that store the binary information the stored information remains valid as long as power is applied to the unit dynamic ram dram stores the binary information in the form of electric charges on capacitors provided inside the chip by mos transistors the stored charge on the capacitors tends to discharge with time and the capacitors must be periodically recharged by refreshing the dynamic memory refreshing is done by cycling through the words every few milliseconds to restore the decaying charge dram offers reduced power consumption and larger storage capacity in single memory chip sram is easier to use and has shorter read and write cycles memory units that lose stored information when power is turned off are said to be volatile cmos integrated circuit rams both static and dynamic are of this category since the binary cells need external power to maintain the stored information in contrast nonvolatile memory such as magnetic disk retains its stored information after the removal section memory decoding of power this type of memory is able to retain information because the data stored on magnetic components are represented by the direction of magnetization which is retained after power is turned off rom is another nonvolatile memory nonvolatile memory enables digital computers to store programs that will be needed again after the computer is turned on programs and data that cannot be altered are stored in rom while other large programs are maintained on magnetic disks the latter programs are transferred into the computer ram as needed before the power is turned off the binary information from the computer ram is transferred to the disk so that the information will be retained memory decoding in addition to requiring storage components in memory unit there is need for decoding circuits to select the memory word specified by the input address in this section we present the internal construction of ram and demonstrate the operation of the decoder to be able to include the entire memory in one diagram the memory unit presented here has small capacity of bits arranged in four words of bits each an example of two dimensional coincident decoding arrangement is presented to show more efficient decoding scheme that is used in large memories we then give an example of address multiplexing commonly used in dram integrated circuits internal construction the internal construction of ram of words and bits per word consists of binary storage cells and associated decoding circuits for selecting individual words the binary storage cell is the basic building block of memory unit the equivalent logic of binary cell that stores one bit of information is shown in fig the storage part of the cell is modeled by an sr latch with associated gates to form d latch actually the select select input output input bc output read write read write block diagram logic diagram figure memory cell cell is an electronic circuit with four to six transistors nevertheless it is possible and convenient to model it in terms of logic symbols binary storage cell must be very small in order to be able to pack as many cells as possible in the small area available in the integrated circuit chip the binary cell stores one bit in its internal latch the select input enables the cell for reading or writing and the read write input determines the operation of the cell when it is selected in the read write input provides the read operation by forming path from the latch to the output terminal in the read write input provides the write operation by forming path from the input terminal to the latch the logical construction of small ram is shown in fig this ram consists of four words of four bits each and has total of binary cells the small blocks labeled bc represent the binary cell with its three inputs and one output as specified in fig memory with four words needs two address lines the two address inputs go through decoder to select one of the four words the decoder is enabled with input data word bc bc bc bc address word inputs bc bc bc bc decoder word bc bc bc bc memory en enable word bc bc bc bc read write output data figure diagram of ram section memory decoding the memory enable input when the memory enable is all outputs of the decoder are and none of the memory words are selected with the memory select at one of the four words is selected dictated by the value in the two address lines once word has been selected the read write input determines the operation during the read operation the four bits of the selected word go through or gates to the output terminals note that the or gates are drawn according to the array logic established in fig during the write operation the data available in the input lines are transferred into the four binary cells of the selected word the binary cells that are not selected are disabled and their previous binary values remain unchanged when the memory select input that goes into the decoder is equal to none of the words are selected and the contents of all cells remain unchanged regardless of the value of the read write input commercial rams may have capacity of thousands of words and each word may range from to bits the logical construction of large capacity memory would be direct extension of the configuration shown here memory with words of bits per word requires address lines that go into k decoder each one of the decoder outputs selects one word of bits for reading or writing coincident decoding decoder with inputs and outputs requires and gates with inputs per gate the total number of gates and the number of inputs per gate can be reduced by employing two decoders in two dimensional selection scheme the basic idea in two dimensional decoding is to arrange the memory cells in an array that is close as possible to square in this configuration two input decoders are used instead of one input decoder one decoder performs the row selection and the other the column selection in two dimensional matrix configuration the two dimensional selection pattern is demonstrated in fig for word memory instead of using single decoder we use two decoders with the single decoder we would need and gates with inputs in each in the two decoder case we need and gates with inputs in each the five most significant bits of the address go to input and the five least significant bits go to input each word within the memory array is selected by the coincidence of one line and one line thus each word in memory is selected by the coincidence between of rows and of columns for total of words note that each intersection represents word that may have any number of bits as an example consider the word whose address is the bit binary equivalent of is this makes binary and binary the bit word that is selected lies in the decoder output number and the decoder output number all the bits of the word are selected for reading or writing address multiplexing the sram memory cell modeled in fig typically contains six transistors in order to build memories with higher density it is necessary to reduce the number of transistors in cell the dram cell contains single mos transistor and capacitor the charge stored decoder binary address decoder y figure two dimensional decoding structure for word memory on the capacitor discharges with time and the memory cells must be periodically recharged by refreshing the memory because of their simple cell structure drams typically have four times the density of srams this allows four times as much memory capacity to be placed on given size of chip the cost per bit of dram storage is three to four times less than that of sram storage further cost savings is realized because of the lower power requirement of dram cells these advantages make dram the preferred technology for large memories in personal digital computers dram chips are available in capacities from to bits most drams have bit word size so several chips have to be combined to produce larger word size because of their large capacity the address decoding of drams is arranged in two dimensional array and larger memories often have multiple arrays to reduce the number of pins in the ic package designers utilize address multiplexing whereby one set of address input pins accommodates the address components in two dimensional array the address is applied in two parts at different times with the row address first and the column address second since the same set of pins is used for both parts of the address the size of the package is decreased significantly we will use word memory to illustrate the address multiplexing idea diagram of the decoding configuration is shown in fig the memory consists of section memory decoding cas column register decoder ras read write address row decoder memory register cell array data data in out figure address multiplexing for dram two dimensional array of cells arranged into rows by columns for total of words there is single data input line single data output line and read write control as well as an eight bit address input and two address strobes the latter included for enabling the row and column address into their respective registers the row address strobe ras enables the eight bit row register and the column address strobe cas enables the eight bit column register the bar on top of the name of the strobe symbol indicates that the registers are enabled on the zero level of the signal the bit address is applied to the dram in two steps using ras and cas initially both strobes are in the state the bit row address is applied to the address inputs and ras is changed to this loads the row address into the row address register ras also enables the row decoder so that it can decode the row address and select one row of the array after time equivalent to the settling time of the row selection ras goes back to the level the bit column address is then applied to the address inputs and cas is driven to the state this transfers the column address into the column register and enables the column decoder now the two parts of the address are in their respective registers the decoders have decoded them to select the one cell corresponding to the row and column address and read or write operation can be performed on that cell cas must go back to the level before initiating another memory operation error detection and correction the dynamic physical interaction of the electrical signals affecting the data path of memory unit may cause occasional errors in storing and retrieving the binary information the reliability of memory unit may be improved by employing error detecting and error correcting codes the most common error detection scheme is the parity bit see section parity bit is generated and stored along with the data word in memory the parity of the word is checked after reading it from memory the data word is accepted if the parity of the bits read out is correct if the parity checked results in an inversion an error is detected but it cannot be corrected an error correcting code generates multiple parity check bits that are stored with the data word in memory each check bit is parity over group of bits in the data word when the word is read back from memory the associated parity bits are also read from memory and compared with new set of check bits generated from the data that have been read if the check bits are correct no error has occurred if the check bits do not match the stored parity they generate unique pattern called syndrome that can be used to identify the bit that is in error single error occurs when bit changes in value from to or from to during the write or read operation if the specific bit in error is identified then the error can be corrected by complementing the erroneous bit hamming code one of the most common error correcting codes used in rams was devised by hamming in the hamming code parity bits are added to an bit data word forming new word of bits the bit positions are numbered in sequence from to those positions numbered as power of are reserved for the parity bits the remaining bits are the data bits the code can be used with words of any length before giving the general characteristics of the code we will illustrate its operation with data word of eight bits consider for example the bit data word we include parity bits with the bit word and arrange the bits as follows bit position section error detection and correction the parity bits and are in positions and respectively the bits of the data word are in the remaining positions each parity bit is calculated as follows xor of bits xor of bits xor of bits xor of bits remember that the exclusive or operation performs the odd function it is equal to for an odd number of in the variables and to for an even number of thus each parity bit is set so that the total number of in the checked positions including the parity bit is always even the bit data word is stored in memory together with the parity bits as bit composite word substituting the bits in their proper positions we obtain the bit composite word stored in memory bit position when the bits are read from memory they are checked again for errors the parity is checked over the same combination of bits including the parity bit the check bits are evaluated as follows xor of bits xor of bits xor of bits xor of bits check bit designates even parity over the checked bits and designates odd parity since the bits were stored with even parity the result indicates that no error has occurred however if then the bit binary number formed by the check bits gives the position of the erroneous bit for example consider the following three cases bit position no error error in bit error in bit in the first case there is no error in the bit word in the second case there is an error in bit position number because it changed from to the third case shows an error in bit position with change from to evaluating the xor of the corresponding bits we determine the check bits to be as follows for no error with error in bit with error in bit thus for no error we have with an error in bit we obtain and with an error in bit we get when the binary number is not equal to it gives the position of the bit in error the error can be corrected by complementing the corresponding bit note that an error can occur in the data word or in one of the parity bits the hamming code can be used for data words of any length in general the hamming code consists of check bits and data bits for total of bits the syndrome value consists of bits and has range of values between and one of these values usually zero is used to indicate that no error was detected leaving values to indicate which of the bits was in error each of these values can be used to uniquely describe bit in error therefore the range of must be equal to or greater than giving the relationship solving for in terms of we obtain n this relationship gives formula for establishing the number of data bits that can be used in conjunction with check bits for example when the number of data bits that can be used is for we have giving the data word may be less than bits but must have at least bits otherwise only check bits will be needed this justifies the use of check bits for the data bits in the previous example ranges of for various values of are listed in table the grouping of bits for parity generation and checking can be determined from list of the binary numbers from through the least significant bit is in the binary numbers and so on the second significant bit is in the binary numbers table range of data bits range of data bits for check bits number of check bits section read only memory and so on comparing these numbers with the bit positions used in generating and checking parity bits in the hamming code we note the relationship between the bit groupings in the code and the position of the bits in the binary count sequence note that each group of bits starts with number that is power of etc these numbers are also the position numbers for the parity bits single error correction double error detection the hamming code can detect and correct only single error by adding another parity bit to the coded word the hamming code can be used to correct single error and detect double errors if we include this additional parity bit then the previous bit coded word becomes where is evaluated from the exclusive or of the other bits this produces the bit word even parity when the bit word is read from memory the check bits are evaluated as is the parity over the entire bits if the parity is correct even parity but if then the parity over the bits is incorrect odd parity the following four cases can arise if and no error occurred if and single error occurred that can be corrected if and double error occurred that is detected but that cannot be corrected if and an error occurred in the bit this scheme may detect more than two errors but is not guaranteed to detect all such errors integrated circuits use modified hamming code to generate and check parity bits for single error correction and double error detection the modified hamming code uses more efficient parity configuration that balances the number of bits used to calculate the xor operation typical integrated circuit that uses an bit data word and bit check word is ic type other integrated circuits are available for data words of and bits these circuits can be used in conjunction with memory unit to correct single error or detect double errors during write and read operations read only memory read only memory rom is essentially memory device in which permanent binary information is stored the binary information must be specified by the designer and is then embedded in the unit to form the required interconnection pattern once the pattern is established it stays within the unit even when power is turned off and on again block diagram of rom consisting of inputs and outputs is shown in fig the inputs provide the address for memory and the outputs give the data bits of the stored word that is selected by the address the number of words in rom is determined from the fact that address input lines are needed to specify words note that rom does not have data inputs because it does not have write operation integrated inputs address n outputs data rom figure rom block diagram circuit rom chips have one or more enable inputs and sometimes come with three state outputs to facilitate the construction of large arrays of rom consider for example rom the unit consists of words of bits each there are five input lines that form the binary numbers from through for the address figure shows the internal logic construction of this rom the five inputs are decoded into distinct outputs by means of decoder each output of the decoder represents memory address the outputs of the decoder are connected to each of the eight or gates the diagram shows the array logic convention used in complex circuits see fig each or gate must be considered as having inputs each output of the decoder is connected to one of the inputs of each or gate since each or gate has input connections and there are or gates the rom contains internal connections in general rom will have an internal decoder and or gates each or gate has inputs which are connected to each of the outputs of the decoder decoder figure internal logic of rom section read only memory the intersections in fig are programmable programmable connection between two lines is logically equivalent to switch that can be altered to be either closed meaning that the two lines are connected or open meaning that the two lines are disconnected the programmable intersection between two lines is sometimes called crosspoint various physical devices are used to implement crosspoint switches one of the simplest technologies employs fuse that normally connects the two points but is opened or blown by the application of high voltage pulse into the fuse the internal binary storage of rom is specified by truth table that shows the word content in each address for example the content of rom may be specified with truth table similar to the one shown in table the truth table shows the five inputs under which are listed all addresses each address stores word of bits which is listed in the outputs columns the table shows only the first four and the last four words in the rom the complete table must include the list of all words the hardware procedure that programs the rom blows fuse links in accordance with given truth table for example programming the rom according to the truth table given by table results in the configuration shown in fig every listed in the truth table specifies the absence of connection and every listed specifies path that is obtained by connection for example the table specifies the eight bit word for permanent storage at address the four in the word are programmed by blowing the fuse links between output of the decoder and the inputs of the or gates associated with outputs and the four in the word are marked with to denote temporary connection in place of dot used for permanent connection in logic diagrams when the input of the rom is all the outputs of the decoder are except for output which is at logic the signal equivalent to logic at decoder output propagates through the connections to the or gate outputs of and the other four outputs remain at the result is that the stored word is applied to the eight data outputs table rom truth table partial inputs outputs i i f decoder figure programming the rom according to table combinational circuit implementation in section it was shown that decoder generates the minterms of the input variables by inserting or gates to sum the minterms of boolean functions we were able to generate any desired combinational circuit the rom is essentially device that includes both the decoder and the or gates within single device to form minterm generator by choosing connections for those minterms which are included in the function the rom outputs can be programmed to represent the boolean functions of the output variables in combinational circuit the internal operation of rom can be interpreted in two ways the first interpretation is that of memory unit that contains fixed pattern of stored words the second interpretation is that of unit which implements combinational circuit from this point of view each output terminal is considered separately as the output of boolean function expressed as sum of minterms for example the rom of fig may be considered to be combinational circuit with eight outputs each function of the five input variables output can be expressed in sum of minterms as the three dots represent minterms through which are not specified in the figure connection marked with in the figure produces minterm for the sum all other crosspoints are not connected and are not included in the sum in practice when combinational circuit is designed by means of rom it is not necessary to design the logic or to show the internal gate connections inside the unit all that the designer has to do is specify the particular rom by its ic number and provide the applicable truth table the truth table gives all the information for programming the rom no internal logic diagram is needed to accompany the truth table section read only memory example design combinational circuit using rom the circuit accepts three bit number and outputs binary number equal to the square of the input number the first step is to derive the truth table of the combinational circuit in most cases this is all that is needed in other cases we can use partial truth table for the rom by utilizing certain properties in the output variables table is the truth table for the combinational circuit three inputs and six outputs are needed to accommodate all possible binary numbers we note that output is always equal to input so there is no need to generate with rom since it is equal to an input variable moreover output is always so this output is known constant we actually need to generate only four outputs with the rom the other two are readily obtained the minimum size of rom needed must have three inputs and four outputs three inputs specify eight words so the rom must be of size the rom implementation is shown in fig the three inputs specify eight words of four bits each the truth table in fig specifies the information needed for programming the rom the block diagram of fig shows the required connections of the combinational circuit table truth table for circuit of example inputs outputs decimal rom rom truth table block diagram figure rom implementation of example types of roms the required paths in rom may be programmed in four different ways the first is called mask programming and is done by the semiconductor company during the last fabrication process of the unit the procedure for fabricating rom requires that the customer fill out the truth table he or she wishes the rom to satisfy the truth table may be submitted in special form provided by the manufacturer or in specified format on computer output medium the manufacturer makes the corresponding mask for the paths to produce the and according to the customers truth table this procedure is costly because the vendor charges the customer special fee for custom masking the particular rom for this reason mask programming is economical only if large quantity of the same rom configuration is to be ordered for small quantities it is more economical to use second type of rom called programmable read only memory or prom when ordered prom units contain all the fuses intact giving all in the bits of the stored words the fuses in the prom are blown by the application of high voltage pulse to the device through special pin blown fuse defines binary state and an intact fuse gives binary state this procedure allows the user to program the prom in the laboratory to achieve the desired relationship between input addresses and stored words special instruments called prom programmers are available commercially to facilitate the procedure in any case all procedures for programming roms are hardware procedures even though the word programming is used the hardware procedure for programming roms or proms is irreversible and once programmed the fixed pattern is permanent and cannot be altered once bit pattern has been established the unit must be discarded if the bit pattern is to be changed third type of rom is the erasable prom or eprom which can be restructured to the initial state even though it has been programmed previously when the eprom is placed under special ultraviolet light for given length of time the shortwave radiation discharges the internal floating gates that serve as the programmed connections after erasure the eprom returns to its initial state and can be reprogrammed to new set of values the fourth type of rom is the electrically erasable prom eeprom or this device is like the eprom except that the previously programmed connections can be erased with an electrical signal instead of ultraviolet light the advantage is that the device can be erased without removing it from its socket flash memory devices are similar to eeproms but have additional built in circuitry to selectively program and erase the device in circuit without the need for special programmer they have widespread application in modern technology in cell phones digital cameras set top boxes digital tv telecommunications nonvolatile data storage and microcontrollers their low consumption of power makes them an attractive storage medium for laptop and notebook computers flash memories incorporate additional circuitry too allowing simultaneous erasing of blocks of memory for example of size to bytes like eeproms flash memories are subject to fatigue typically having about block erase cycles section programmable logic array inputs fixed programmable outputs and array or array decoder programmable read only memory prom inputs programmable fixed outputs and array or array programmable array logic pal inputs programmable programmable outputs and array or array programmable logic array pla figure basic configuration of three plds combinational plds the prom is combinational programmable logic device pld an integrated circuit with programmable gates divided into an and array and an or array to provide an andcor sum of product implementation there are three major types of combinational plds differing in the placement of the programmable connections in the andc or array figure shows the configuration of the three plds the prom has fixed and array constructed as decoder and programmable or array the programmable or gates implement the boolean functions in sum of minterms form the pal has programmable and array and fixed or array the and gates are programmed to provide the product terms for the boolean functions which are logically summed in each or gate the most flexible pld is the pla in which both the and and or arrays can be programmed the product terms in the and array may be shared by any or gate to provide the required sum of products implementation the names pal and pla emerged from different vendors during the development of plds the implementation of combinational circuits with prom was demonstrated in this section the design of combinational circuits with pla and pal is presented in the next two sections programmable logic array the pla is similar in concept to the prom except that the pla does not provide full decoding of the variables and does not generate all the minterms the decoder is replaced by an array of and gates that can be programmed to generate any product term of the input variables the product terms are then connected to or gates to provide the sum of products for the required boolean functions the internal logic of pla with three inputs and two outputs is shown in fig such circuit is too small to be useful commercially but is presented here to demonstrate the typical logic configuration of pla the diagram uses the array logic graphic symbols for complex circuits each input goes through buffercinverter combination shown in the diagram with composite graphic symbol that has both the true and complement outputs each input and its complement are connected to the inputs of each and gate as indicated by the intersections between the vertical and horizontal lines the outputs of the and gates are connected to the inputs of each or gate the output of the or gate goes to an xor gate where the other input can be programmed to receive signal equal to either logic or logic the output is inverted when the xor input is connected to since the output does not change when the xor input is connected to since the particular boolean functions implemented in the pla of fig are ab ac abc ac bc b ab ac bc abc c b a figure pla with three inputs four product terms and two outputs section programmable logic array the product terms generated in each and gate are listed along the output of the gate in the diagram the product term is determined from the inputs whose crosspoints are connected and marked with the output of an or gate gives the logical sum of the selected product terms the output may be complemented or left in its true form depending on the logic being realized the fuse map of pla can be specified in tabular form for example the programming table that specifies the pla of fig is listed in table pla programming table consists of three sections the first section lists the product terms numerically the second section specifies the required paths between inputs and and gates the third section specifies the paths between the and and or gates for each output variable we may have t for true or for complement for programming the xor gate the product terms listed on the left are not part of the table they are included for reference only for each product term the inputs are marked with or dash if variable in the product term appears in the form in which it is true the corresponding input variable is marked with if it appears complemented the corresponding input variable is marked with if the variable is absent from the product term it is marked with dash the paths between the inputs and the and gates are specified under the column head inputs in the programming table in the input column specifies connection from the input variable to the and gate in the input column specifies connection from the complement of the variable to the input of the and gate dash specifies blown fuse in both the input variable and its complement it is assumed that an open terminal in the input of an and gate behaves like the paths between the and and or gates are specified under the column head outputs the output variables are marked with for those product terms which are included in the function each product term that has in the output column requires path from the output of the and gate to the input of the or gate those marked with dash specify blown fuse it is assumed that an open terminal in the input of an or gate behaves like finally t true output dictates that the other input of the corresponding xor gate be connected to and c complement specifies connection to table pla programming table product term inputs outputs ab bc ac bc abc note see text for meanings of dashes the size of pla is specified by the number of inputs the number of product terms and the number of outputs typical integrated circuit pla may have inputs product terms and eight outputs for inputs product terms and outputs the internal logic of the pla consists of buffercinverter gates and gates or gates and xor gates there are connections between the inputs and the and array connections between the and and or arrays and connections associated with the xor gates in designing digital system with pla there is no need to show the internal connections of the unit as was done in fig all that is needed is pla programming table from which the pla can be programmed to supply the required logic as with rom the pla may be mask programmable or field programmable with mask programming the customer submits pla program table to the manufacturer this table is used by the vendor to produce custom made pla that has the required internal logic specified by the customer second type of pla that is available is the field programmable logic array or fpla which can be programmed by the user by means of commercial hardware programmer unit in implementing combinational circuit with pla careful investigation must be undertaken in order to reduce the number of distinct product terms since pla has finite number of and gates this can be done by simplifying each boolean function to minimum number of terms the number of literals in term is not important since all the input variables are available anyway both the true value and the complement of each function should be simplified to see which one can be expressed with fewer product terms and which one provides product terms that are common to other functions example implement the following two boolean functions with pla b the two functions are simplified in the maps of fig both the true value and the complement of the functions are simplified into sum of products form the combination that gives the minimum number of product terms is ab ac bc and ab ac abc this combination gives four distinct product terms ab ac bc and abc the pla programming table for the combination is shown in the figure note that output is the true output even though c is marked over it in the table this is because is generated with an andcor circuit and is available at the output of the or gate the xor gate complements the function to produce the true output section programmable array logic pla programming table bc bc a outputs product inputs term b ab ac bc abc c figure solution to example the combinational circuit used in example is too simple for implementing with pla it was presented merely for purposes of illustration typical pla has large number of inputs and product terms the simplification of boolean functions with so many variables should be carried out by means of computer assisted simplification procedures the computer aided design cad program simplifies each function and its complement to minimum number of terms the program then selects minimum number of product terms that cover all functions in the form in which they are true or in their complemented form the pla programming table is then generated and the required fuse map obtained the fuse map is applied to an fpla programmer that goes through the hardware procedure of blowing the internal fuses in the integrated circuit programmable array logic the pal is programmable logic device with fixed or array and programmable and array because only the and gates are programmable the pal is easier to program than but is not as flexible as the pla figure shows the logic configuration of typical pal with four inputs and four outputs each input has buffercinverter gate and each output is generated by fixed or gate there are four sections in the unit each composed of an andcor array that is three wide the term used to indicate that there are three programmable and gates in each section and one fixed or gate each and gate has programmable input connections shown in the diagram by vertical lines intersecting each horizontal line the horizontal line symbolizes the multiple input configuration of the and gate one of the outputs is connected to buffercinverter gate and then fed back into two inputs of the and gates commercial pal devices contain more gates than the one shown in fig typical pal integrated circuit may have eight inputs eight outputs and eight sections each consisting of an eight wide andcor array the output terminals are sometimes driven by three state buffers or inverters in designing with pal the boolean functions must be simplified to fit into each section unlike the situation with pla product term cannot be shared among two or more or gates therefore each function can be simplified by itself without regard product and gates inputs term figure pal with four inputs four outputs and three wide andcor structure section programmable array logic to common product terms the number of product terms in each section is fixed and if the number of terms in the function is too large it may be necessary to use two sections to implement one boolean function as an example of using pal in the design of combinational circuit consider the following boolean functions given in sum of minterms form a x y z simplifying the four functions to minimum number of terms results in the following boolean functions abc abcd bcd ab cd bd abc abcd acd abcd acd abcd note that the function for has four product terms the logical sum of two of these terms is equal to by using it is possible to reduce the number of terms for from four to three the pal programming table is similar to the one used for the pla except that only the inputs of the and gates need to be programmed table lists the pal table pal programming table and inputs product term ab cdw outputs abc abcd bcd ab cd bd acd abcd product and gates inputs term a b c d w x all fuses intact always z fuse intact fuse blown d a b c d w figure fuse map for pal as specified in table section sequential programmable devices programming table for the four boolean functions the table is divided into four sections with three product terms in each to conform with the pal of fig the first two sections need only two product terms to implement the boolean function the last section for output needs four product terms using the output from we can reduce the function to three terms the fuse map for the pal as specified in the programming table is shown in fig for each or in the table we mark the corresponding intersection in the diagram with the symbol for an intact fuse for each dash we mark the diagram with blown fuses in both the true and complement inputs if the and gate is not used we leave all its input fuses intact since the corresponding input receives both the true value and the complement of each input variable we have aa and the output of the and gate is always as with all plds the design with pals is facilitated by using cad techniques the blowing of internal fuses is hardware procedure done with the help of special electronic instruments sequential programmable devices digital systems are designed with flip flops and gates since the combinational pld consists of only gates it is necessary to include external flip flops when they are used in the design sequential programmable devices include both gates and flip flops in this way the device can be programmed to perform variety of sequential circuit functions there are several types of sequential programmable devices available commercially and each device has vendor specific variants within each type the internal logic of these devices is too complex to be shown here therefore we will describe three major types without going into their detailed construction sequential or simple programmable logic device spld complex programmable logic device cpld field programmable gate array fpga the sequential pld is sometimes referred to as simple pld to differentiate it from the complex pld the spld includes flip flops in addition to the andcor array within the integrated circuit chip the result is sequential circuit as shown in fig pal or pla is modified by including number of flip flops connected to form register the circuit outputs can be taken from the or gates or from the outputs of the inputs andcor array outputs pal or pla flip flops figure sequential programmable logic device flip flops additional programmable connections are available to include the flip flop outputs in the product terms formed with the and array the flip flops may be of the or the jk type the first programmable device developed to support sequential circuit implementation is the field programmable logic sequencer fpls typical fpls is organized around pla with several outputs driving flip flops the flip flops are flexible in that they can be programmed to operate as either the jk or the type the fpls did not succeed commercially because it has too many programmable connections the configuration mostly used in an spld is the combinational pal together with flip flops pal that includes flip flops is referred to as registered pal to signify that the device contains flip flops in addition to the andcor array each section of an spld is called macrocell which is circuit that contains sum of products combinational logic function and an optional flip flop we will assume an andcor sum of products function but in practice it can be any one of the two level implementations presented in section figure shows the logic of basic macrocell the andcor array is the same as in the combinational pal shown in fig the output is driven by an edge triggered flip flop connected to common clock input and changes state on clock edge the output of the flip flop is connected to three state buffer or inverter controlled by an output enable signal marked in the diagram as oe the output of the flip flop is fed back into one of the inputs of the programmable and gates to provide the present state condition for the sequential circuit typical spld has from to macrocells within clk oe clk figure basic macrocell logic section sequential programmable devices one ic package all the flip flops are connected to the common clk input and all three state buffers are controlled by the oe input in addition to programming the and array macrocell may have other programming features typical programming options include the ability to either use or bypass the flip flop the selection of clock edge polarity the selection of preset and clear for the register and the selection of the true value or complement of an output an xor gate is used to program true complement condition multiplexers select between two or four distinct paths by programming the selection inputs the design of digital system using plds often requires the connection of several devices to produce the complete specification for this type of application it is more economical to use complex programmable logic device cpld which is collection of individual plds on single integrated circuit programmable interconnection structure allows the plds to be connected to each other in the same way that can be done with individual plds figure shows the general configuration of cpld the device consists of multiple plds interconnected through programmable switch matrix the inputcoutput o blocks provide the connections to the ic pins each o pin is driven by three state buffer and can be programmed to act as input or output the switch matrix receives inputs from the o block and directs them to the individual macrocells similarly selected outputs from macrocells are sent to the outputs as needed each pld typically contains from to macrocells usually fully connected if macrocell has unused product terms they can be used by other nearby macrocells in some cases the macrocell flip flop is programmed to act as d jk or flip flop different manufacturers have taken different approaches to the general architecture of cplds areas in which they differ include the individual plds sometimes called pld pld pld pld pld o programmable switch matrix o block block pld pld pld figure general cpld configuration function blocks the type of macrocells the o blocks and the programmable interconnection structure the best way to investigate vendor specific device is to look at the manufacturers literature the basic component used in vlsi design is the gate array which consists of pattern of gates fabricated in an area of silicon that is repeated thousands of times until the entire chip is covered with gates arrays of one thousand to several hundred thousand gates are fabricated within single ic chip depending on the technology used the design with gate arrays requires that the customer provide the manufacturer the desired interconnection pattern the first few levels of the fabrication process are common and independent of the final logic function additional fabrication steps are required to interconnect the gates according to the specifications given by the designer field programmable gate array fpga is vlsi circuit that can be programmed at the users location typical fpga consists of an array of millions of logic blocks surrounded by programmable input and output blocks and connected together via programmable interconnections there is wide variety of internal configurations within this group of devices the performance of each type of device depends on the circuit contained in its logic blocks and the efficiency of its programmed interconnections typical fpga logic block consists of lookup tables multiplexers gates and flip flops lookup table is truth table stored in an sram and provides the combinational circuit functions for the logic block these functions are realized from the lookup table in the same way that combinational circuit functions are implemented with rom as described in section for example sram can store the truth table of combinational circuit that has four inputs and two outputs the combinational logic section along with number of programmable multiplexers is used to configure the input equations for the flip flop and the output of the logic block the advantage of using ram instead of rom to store the truth table is that the table can be programmed by writing into memory the disadvantage is that the memory is volatile and presents the need for the lookup tables content to be reloaded in the event that power is disrupted the program can be downloaded either from host computer or from an onboard prom the program remains in sram until the fpga is reprogrammed or the power is turned off the device must be reprogrammed every time power is turned on the ability to reprogram the fpga can serve variety of applications by using different logic implementations in the program the design with pld cpld or fpga requires extensive computer aided design cad tools to facilitate the synthesis procedure among the tools that are available are schematic entry packages and hardware description languages hdls such as abel vhdl and verilog synthesis tools are available that allocate configure and connect logic blocks to match high level design description written in hdl as an example of cmos fpga technology we will discuss the xilinx see www altera com for an alternative cmos fpga architecture section sequential programmable devices xilinx fpgas xilinx launched the worlds first commercial fpga in with the vintage device the and families soon followed setting the stage for todays spartan and virtex device families each evolution of devices brought improvements in density performance power consumption voltage levels pin counts and functionality for example the spartan family of devices initially offered maximum of system gates but todays spartan offers logic cells plus block ram basic xilinx architecture the basic architecture of spartan and earlier device families consists of an array of configurable logic blocks clbs variety of local and global routing resources and

multiplexers registers and paths for control signals as shown in fig of the function generators and of the lookup table can generate any arbitrary function of four inputs and the third can generate any boolean function of three inputs the function block can get its inputs from the and lookup tables or from external inputs the three function generators can be programmed to generate three different functions of three independent sets of variables two with four inputs and one with three inputsone function must be registered within the clb an arbitrary function of five variables an arbitrary function of four variables together with some functions of six variables and some functions of nine variables each clb has two storage devices that can be configured as edge triggered flip flops with common clock or in the they can be configured as flip flops or as transparent latches with common clock programmed for either edge and separately invertible and an enable the storage elements can get their inputs from the function generators or from the din input the other element can get an external input from the input the function generators can also drive two outputs and directly and independently of the outputs of the storage elements all of these outputs can be connected to the interconnect network the storage elements are driven by global set reset during power up the global set reset is programmed to match the programming of the local r control for given storage element distributed ram the three function generators within clb can be used as either dual port ram or single port ram the devices do not have block ram but group of their clbs can form an array of memory spartan devices have block ram in addition to distributed ram interconnect resources grid of switch matrices overlays the architecture of clbs to provide general purpose interconnect for branching and routing throughout the device the interconnect has three types of general purpose interconnects single length lines double length lines and long lines grid of horizontal and vertical single length lines connects an array of switch boxes that provide reduced number of connections between signal paths within each box not full crossbar switch each clb has pair of three state buffers that can drive signals onto the nearest horizontal lines above or below the clb direct dedicated interconnect lines provide routing between adjacent vertical and horizontal clbs in the same column or row these are relatively high speed local connections through metal but are not as fast as hardwired metal connection because of the delay incurred by routing the signal paths through the transmission gates that configure the path direct interconnect lines do not use the switch matrices thus eliminating the delay incurred on paths going through see xilinx documentation for the pin out conventions to establish local interconnects between clbs din ec din r control logic function d sd

clbs before entering switch matrix skipping every other clb these lines provide more efficient implementation of intermediate length connections by eliminating switch matrix from the path thereby reducing the delay of the path long lines span the entire array vertically and horizontally they drive low skew high fan out control signals long vertical lines have programmable splitter that segments the lines and allows two independent routing channels spanning one half of the array but located in the same column the routing resources are exploited automatically by the routing software there are eight low skew global buffers for clock distribution the signals that drive long lines are buffered long lines can be driven by adjacent clbs or iobs and may connect to three state buffers that are available to clbs long lines provide three state buses within the architecture and implement wired and logic each horizontal long line is driven by three state buffer and can be programmed to connect to pull up resistor which pulls the line to logical if no driver is asserted on the line the programmable interconnect resources of the device connect clbs and iobs either directly or through switch boxes these resources consist of grid of two layers of metal segments and programmable interconnect points pips within switch boxes pip is cmos transmission gate whose state on or off is determined by the content of static ram cell in the programmable memory as shown in fig the connection is established when the transmission gate is on e when is applied at the gate of the channel transistor and is applied at the gate of the channel transistor thus the device can be reprogrammed simply by changing the contents of the controlling memory cell the architecture of pip based interconnection in switch box is shown in fig which shows possible signal paths through pip the configuration of cmos transmission gates determines the connection between horizontal line and the opposite horizontal line and between the vertical lines at the connection each switch matrix pip requires six pass transistors to establish full connectivity section sequential programmable devices

programmable iob it can be used as an input an output or bidirectional port an iob that is configured as an input can have direct latched or registered input in an output configuration the iob has direct or registered output the output buffer of an iob has skew and slew control the registers available to the input and output path of an iob are driven by separate invertible clocks there is global set reset internal delay elements compensate for the delay induced when clock signal passes through global buffer before reaching an iob this strategy eliminates the hold condition on the data at an external pin the three state output of an iob puts the output buffer in high impedance state the output and the enable for the output can be inverted the slew rate of the output buffer can be controlled to minimize transients on the power bus when noncritical signals are switched the iob pin can be programmed for pull up or pull down to prevent needless power consumption and noise the devices have embedded logic to support the ieee jtag boundary scan standard there is an on chip test access port tap controller and the o cells can be configured as shift register under testing the device can be checked to verify that all the pins on pc board are connected and operate properly by creating serial chain of all of the o pins of the chips on the board master three state control

earlier devices consists of an array of clb tiles mingled within an array of switch matrices surrounded by perimeter of iobs these devices support only distributed memory whose use reduces the number

not support low voltage differential signaling lvds or low voltage positive emitter coupled logic lvpecl o standards section sequential programmable devices application large on chip memory can improve system performance by eliminating or reducing the need to access off chip storage reliable clock distribution is the key to the synchronous operation of high speed digital circuits if the clock signal arrives at different times at different parts of circuit the device may fail to operate correctly clock skew reduces the available time budget of circuit by lengthening the setup time at registers it can also shorten the effective hold time margin of flip flop in shift register and cause the register to shift incorrectly at high clock frequencies shorter clock periods the effect of skew is more significant because it represents larger fraction of the clock cycle time buffered clock trees are commonly used to minimize clock skew in fpgas xilinx provides all digital dlls for clock synchronization or management in high speed circuits dlls eliminate the clock distribution delay and provide frequency multipliers frequency dividers and clock mirrors spartan ii devices are suitable

programmable logic data book ram rom design at the register transfer level introduction the behavior of many digital systems depends on the history of their inputs and the conditions that determine their future actions depend on the results of previous actions such systems are said to have memory digital system is sequential logic system constructed with flip flops and gates sequential circuits can be specified by means of state tables as shown in chapter to specify large digital system with state table is very difficult because the number of states would be enormous to overcome this difficulty digital systems are designed via modular approach the system is partitioned into subsystems each of which performs some function the modules are constructed from such digital devices as registers decoders multiplexers arithmetic elements and control logic the various modules are interconnected with datapaths and control signals to form digital system in this chapter we will introduce design methodology for describing and designing large complex digital systems register transfer level notation the modules of digital system are best defined by set of registers and the operations that are performed on the binary information stored in them examples of register operations are shift count clear and load registers are assumed to be the basic components of the digital system the information flow and processing performed on the data stored in the registers are referred to as register transfer operations well see subsequently how hardware description language hdl includes operators that correspond to the register transfer operations of digital system digital system is represented at the register transfer level rtl when it is specified by the following three components the set of registers in the system the operations that are performed on the data stored in the registers the control that supervises the sequence of operations in the system register is connected group of flip flops that stores binary information and has the capability of performing one or more elementary operations register can load new information or shift the information to the right or the left counter is register that increments number by fixed value g flip flop is one bit register that can be set cleared or complemented in fact the flip flops and associated gates of any sequential circuit can be called registers by this definition the operations executed on the information stored in registers are elementary operations that are performed in parallel on the bits of data word during one clock cycle the data produced by the operation may replace the binary information that was in the register before the operation executed alternatively the result may be transferred to another register e an operation on register may leave its contents unchanged the digital circuits introduced in chapter are registers that implement elementary operations counter with parallel load is able to perform the increment by one and load operations bidirectional shift register is able to perform the shift right and shift left operations by shifting its contents by one or more bits in specified direction the operations in digital system are controlled by signals that sequence the operations in prescribed manner certain conditions that depend on results of previous operations may determine the sequence of future operations the outputs of the control logic of digital system are binary variables that initiate the various operations in the systems registers information transfer from one register to another is designated in symbolic form by means of replacement operator the statement denotes transfer of the contents of register into register is replacement of the contents of register by the contents of register for example an eight bit register holding the value could have its contents replaced by holding the value by definition the contents of the source register do not change after the transfer they are merely copied to the arrow symbolizes the transfer and its direction it points from the register whose contents are being transferred and towards the register that will receive the contents control signal would determine when the operation actually executes the controller in digital system is finite state machine see chapter whose outputs are the control signals governing the register operations in synchronous machines the operations are synchronized by the system clock for example register might be synchronized to have its contents replaced at the positive edge of the clock statement that specifies register transfer operation implies that datapath e set of circuit connections is available from the outputs of the source register to the section register transfer level notation inputs of the destination register and that the destination register has parallel load capability data can be transferred serially between registers too by repeatedly shifting their contents along single wire one bit at time normally we want register transfer operation to occur not with every clock cycle but only under predetermined condition conditional statement governing register transfer operation is symbolized with an ifcthen statement such as if then where is control signal generated in the control section note that the clock is not included as variable in the register transfer statements it is assumed that all transfers occur at clock edge transition e transition from to or from to although control condition such as may become true before the clock transition the actual transfer does not occur until the clock transition does the transfers are initiated and synchronized by the action of the clock signal but the actual transition of the outputs in physical system does not result in instantaneous transitions at the outputs of the registers propagation delays depend on the physical characteristics of the transistors implementing the flip flops of the register and the wires connecting devices there is always delay however small between cause and its effect in physical system comma may be used to separate two or more operations that are executed at the same time concurrently consider the statement if then d this statement specifies an operation that exchanges the contents of two registers moreover the operation in both registers is triggered by the same clock edge provided that this simultaneous concurrent operation is possible with registers that have edge triggered flip flops controlled by common clock synchronizing signal other examples of register transfers are as follows add contents of to gets increment by count upwards shr shift right clear to in hardware addition is done with binary parallel adder incrementing is done with counter and the shift operation is implemented with shift register the type of operations most often encountered in digital systems can be classified into four categories transfer operations which transfer e copy data from one register to another arithmetic operations which perform arithmetic g multiplication on data in registers logic operations which perform bit manipulation g logical or of nonnumeric data in registers shift operations which shift data between registers the transfer operation does not change the information content of the data being moved from the source register to the destination register unless the source and destination are the same the other three operations change the information content during the transfer the register transfer notation and the symbols used to represent the various register transfer operations are not standardized in this text we employ two types of notation the notation introduced in this section will be used informally to specify and explain digital systems at the register transfer level the next section introduces the rtl symbols used in the verilog hdl which is standardized register transfer level in hdl digital systems can be described at the register transfer level by means of hdl in the verilog hdl descriptions of rtl operations use combination of behavioral and dataflow constructs and are employed to specify the register operations and the combinational logic functions implemented by hardware register transfers are specified by means of procedural assignment statements within an edge sensitive cyclic behavior combinational circuit functions are specified at the rtl level by means of continuous assignment statements or by procedural assignment statements within level sensitive cyclic behavior the symbol used to designate register transfer is either an equals sign or an arrow the symbol used to specify combinational circuit function is an equals sign synchronization with the clock is represented by associating with an always statement an event control expression in which sensitivity to the clock event is qualified by posedge or negedge the always keyword indicates that the associated block of statements will be executed repeatedly for the life of the simulation the operator and the event control expression preceding the block of statements synchronize the execution of the statements to the clock event the following examples show the various ways to specify register transfer operation in verilog assign continuous assignment for addition operation always level sensitive cyclic behavior combinational logic for addition operation edge sensitive cyclic behavior always negedge clock blocking procedural assignment for addition begin register transfer operation ra ra rb rd ra edge sensitive cyclic behavior end nonblocking procedural assignment for addition always negedge clock register transfer operation begin ra ra rb rd ra end continuous assignments g assign are used to represent and specify combinational logic circuits in simulation continuous assignment statement executes when the expression on the right hand side changes the effect of execution is immediate section register transfer level in hdl the variable on the left hand side is updated similarly level sensitive cyclic behavior g always executes during simulation when change is detected by its event control expression sensitivity list the effect of assignments made by the operator is immediate the continuous assignment statement assign describes binary adder with inputs and and output the target operand in continuous assignment statement in this case cannot be register data type but must be type of net for example wire the procedural assignment made in the level sensitive cyclic behavior in the second example shows an alternative way of specifying combinational circuit for addition within the cyclic behavior the mechanism of the sensitivity list ensures that the output will be updated whenever or or both change there are two kinds of procedural assignments blocking and nonblocking the two are distinguished by their symbols and by their operation blocking assignments use the equals symbol as the assignment operator and nonblocking assignments use the left arrow as the operator blocking assignment statements are executed sequentially in the order that they are listed in sequential block when they execute they have an immediate effect on the contents of memory before the next statement can be executed nonblocking assignments are made concurrently this feature is implemented by evaluating the expression on the right hand side of each statement in the list of statements before making the assignment to their left hand sides consequently there is no interaction between the result of any assignment and the evaluation of an expression affecting another assignment also the statements associated with an edge sensitive cyclic behavior do not execute until the indicated edge condition occurs consider in the example given above in the list of blocking procedural assignment the first statement transfers the sum ra rb to ra and the second statement transfers the new value of ra into rd the value in ra after the clock event is the sum of the values in ra and rb immediately before the clock event at the completion of the operation both ra and rd have the same value in the nonblocking procedural assignment above the two assignments are performed concurrently so that rd receives the original value of ra the activity in both examples is launched by the clock undergoing falling edge transition the registers in system are clocked simultaneously concurrently the input of each flip flop determines the value that will be assigned to its output independently of the input to any other flip flop to ensure synchronous operations in rtl design and to ensure match between an hdl model and the circuit synthesized from the model it is necessary that nonblocking procedural assignments be used for all variables that are assigned value within an edge sensitive cyclic behavior always clocked the nonblocking assignment that appears in an edge sensitive cyclic behavior models the behavior of the hardware of synchronous sequential circuit accurately in general the blocking assignment operator is used in procedural assignment statement only when it is necessary to specify sequential ordering of multiple assignment statements hdl operators the verilog hdl operators and their symbols used in rtl design are listed in table the arithmetic logic and shift operators describe register transfer operations the table verilog hdl operators operator type symbol operation performed addition arithmetic subtraction multiplication division modulus exponentiation negation complement and or exclusive or xor negation and or bitwise or reduction logical right shift logical left shift arithmetic right shift arithmetic left shift concatenation greater than less than equality logical inequality case equality case inequality greater than or equal less than or equal shift relational logical and relational operators specify control conditions and have boolean expressions as their arguments the operands of the arithmetic operators are numbers the and operators form the sum difference product and quotient respectively of pair of operands the exponentiation operator was added to the language in and forms double precision floating point value from base and exponent having real integer section register transfer level in hdl or signed value negative numbers are represented in complement form the modulus operator produces the remainder from the division of two numbers for example evaluates to there are two types of binary operators for binary words bitwise and reduction the bitwise operators perform bit by bit operation on two vector operands to form vector result they take each bit in one operand and perform the operation with the corresponding bit in the other operand negation is unary operator it complements the bits of single vector operand to form vector result the reduction operators are also unary acting on single operand and producing scalar one bit result they operate pairwise on the bits of word from right to left and yield one bit result for example the reduction nor results in with operand and in with operand the result of applying the nor operation on the first two bits is used with the third bit and so forth negation is not used as reduction operatorits operation on vector produces vector truth tables for the bitwise operators acting on pair of scalar operands are the same as those listed in table in section for the corresponding verilog primitive g the and primitive and the bitwise operator have the same truth table the output of an and gate with two scalar inputs is the same as the result produced by operating on the two bits with the operator the logical and relational operators are used to form boolean expressions and can take variables or expressions as operands note variable is also an expression used basically for determining true or false conditions the logical and relational operators evaluate to if the condition expressed is true and to if the condition is false if the condition is ambiguous they evaluate to an operand that is variable evaluates to if the value of the variable is equal to zero and to if the value is not equal to zero for example if and then the expression has the boolean value the number in question is not equal to and the expression has the boolean value results of other operations with these values are as follows logical and bitwise and logical or bitwise or logical negation bitwise negation logical negation bitwise negation is greater than identity equality the relational operators and test for bitwise equality identity and inequality in verilogs four valued logic system for example if and the test would evaluate to true but the test would evaluate to verilog has logical and arithmetic shift operators the logical shift operators shift vector operand to the right or the left by specified number of bits the vacated bit positions are filled with zeros for example if then the statement shifts to the right one position the value of that results from the logical right shift operation is in contrast the arithmetic right shift operator fills the vacated cell the most significant bit msb with its original contents when the word is shifted to the right the arithmetic left shift operator fills the vacated cell with when the word is shifted to the left the arithmetic right shift operator is used when the sign extension of number is important if then the statement produces the result if it produces the result there is no distinction between the logical left shift and the arithmetic left shift operators the concatenation operator provides mechanism for appending multiple operands it can be used to specify shift including the bits transferred into the vacant positions this aspect of its operation was shown in hdl example for the shift register expressions are evaluated from left to right and their operators associate from left to right with the exception of the conditional operator according to the precedence shown in table for example in the expression c the value of is added to and then is subtracted from the result in the expression c the value of is divided by and then the result is added to because the division operator has higher precedence than the addition operator use parentheses to establish precedence for example the expression is not the same as the expression c loop statements verilog hdl has four types of loops that execute procedural statements repeatedly repeat forever while and for all looping statements must appear inside an initial or always block the repeat loop executes the associated statements specified number of times the following is an example that was used previously initial begin clock repeat clock clock end this code toggles the clock times and produces eight clock cycles with cycle time of time units section register transfer level in hdl table highest precedence verilog operator precedence lowest precedence unary binary binary binary binary conditional operator the forever loop causes unconditional repetitive execution of procedural statement or block of procedural statements for example the following loop produces continuous clock having cycle time of time units initial begin clock forever clock clock end the while loop executes statement or block of statements repeatedly while an expression is true if the expression is false to begin with the statement is never executed the following example illustrates the use of the while loop integer count initial begin count while count count count end the value of count is incremented from to each increment is delayed by five time units and the loop exits at the count of in dealing with looping statements it is sometimes convenient to use the integer data type to index the loop integers are declared with the keyword integer as in the previous example although it is possible to use reg variable to index loop sometimes it is more convenient to declare an integer variable rather than reg for counting purposes variables declared as data type reg are stored as unsigned numbers those declared as data type integer are store as signed numbers in complement format the default width of an integer is minimum of bits the for loop is compact way to express the operations implied by list of statements whose variables are indexed the for loop contains three parts separated by two semicolons an initial condition an expression to check for the terminating condition an assignment to change the control variable the following is an example of for loop for begin procedural statements go here end the for loop statement repeats the execution of the procedural statements eight times the control variable is the initial condition is and the loop is repeated as long as is less than after each execution of the loop statement the value of is incremented by description of two to four line decoder using for loop is shown in hdl example since output is evaluated in procedural statement it must be declared as type reg the control variable for the loop is the integer when the loop is expanded unrolled we get the following four conditions in and are in binary and the index for is in decimal if in then else if in then else if in then else if in then else hdl example decoder description of decoder using for loop statement module decoder in input in two binary inputs output four binary outputs reg integer control index variable for loop section register transfer level in hdl always in for if in k else k endmodule logic synthesis logic synthesis is the automatic process by which computer based program e synthesis tool transforms an hdl model of logic circuit into an optimized netlist of gates that perform the operations specified by the source code there are various target technologies that implement the synthesized design in hardware the effective use of an hdl description requires that designers adopt vendor specific style suitable for the particular synthesis tools the type of ics that implement the design may be an application specific integrated circuit asic programmable logic device pld or field programmable gate array fpga logic synthesis is widely used in industry to design and implement large circuits efficiently correctly and rapidly logic synthesis tools interpret the source code of the hdl and translate it into an optimized gate structure accomplishing correctly all of the work that would be done by manual methods using karnaugh maps designs written in verilog or comparable language for the purpose of logic synthesis tend to be at the register transfer level this is because the hdl constructs used in an rtl description can be converted into gate level description in straightforward manner the following examples discuss how logic synthesizer can interpret an hdl construct and convert it into gate structure the continuous assignment assign statement is used to describe combinational circuits in an hdl it represents boolean equation for logic circuit continuous assignment with boolean expression for the right hand side of the assignment statement is synthesized into the corresponding gate circuit implementing the expression an expression with an addition operator is interpreted as binary adder using full adder circuits an expression with subtraction operator is converted into gate level subtractor consisting of full adders and exclusive or gates fig statement with conditional operator such as assign translates into two to one line multiplexer with control input and data inputs and statement with multiple conditional operators specifies larger multiplexer cyclic behavior always may imply combinational or sequential circuit depending on whether the event control expression is level sensitive or edge sensitive synthesis tool will interpret as combinational logic level sensitive cyclic behavior whose event control expression is sensitive to every variable that is referenced within the behavior g by the variables appearing in the right hand side of an assignment statement the event control expression in description of combinational logic may not be sensitive to an edge of any signal for example always or or alternative if else translates into two to one line multiplexer as an alternative the case statement may be used to imply large multiplexers the casex statement treats the logic values and as dont cares when they appear in either the case expression or case item an edge sensitive cyclic behavior g always posedge clock specifies synchronous clocked sequential circuit the implementation of the corresponding circuit consists of flip flops and the gates that implement the synchronous register transfer operations specified by the statements associated with the event control expression examples of such circuits are registers and counters sequential circuit description with case statement translates into control circuit with flip flops and gates that form the inputs to the flip flops thus each statement in an rtl description is interpreted by the synthesizer and assigned to corresponding gate and flip flop circuit for synthesizable sequential circuits the event control expression must be sensitive to the positive or the negative edge of the clock synchronizing signal but not to both simplified flowchart of the process used by industry to design digital systems is shown in fig the rtl description of the hdl design is simulated and checked for proper operation its operational features must match those given in the specification for the behavior of the circuit the test bench provides the stimulus signals to the simulator if the result of the simulation is not satisfactory the hdl description is corrected and checked again after the simulation run shows valid design the rtl description is ready to be compiled by the logic synthesizer all errors syntax and functional in the description must be eliminated before synthesis the synthesis tool generates netlist equivalent to gate level description of the design as it is represented by the model if the model fails to express the functionality of the specification the circuit will fail to do so also the gate level circuit is simulated with the same set of stimuli used to check the rtl design if any corrections are needed the process is repeated until satisfactory simulation is achieved the results of the two simulations are compared to see if they match if they do not the designer must change the rtl description to correct any errors in the design then the description is compiled again by the logic synthesizer to generate new gate level description once the designer is satisfied with the results of all simulation tests the design of the circuit is ready for physical implementation in technology in practice additional testing will be performed to verify that the timing specifications of the circuit can be met in the chosen hardware technology that issue is not within the scope of this text logic synthesis provides several advantages to the designer it takes less time to write an hdl description and synthesize gate level realization than it does to develop the circuit by manual entry from schematic diagrams the ease of changing the description facilitates exploration of design alternatives it is faster easier less expensive and less risky to check the validity of the design by simulation than it is to produce hardware section algorithmic state machines asms develop specification develop edit hdl description simulate verify hdl description no test bench correct synthesize yes develop compare netlist manually simulation yes synthesis no gate level tools results model simulate netlist model create production yes match no masks for ics figure simplified flowchart for hdl based modeling verification and synthesis prototype for evaluation schematic and the database for fabricating the integrated circuit can be generated automatically by synthesis tools the hdl model can be compiled by different tools into different technologies g asic cells or fpgas providing multiple returns on the investment to create the model algorithmic state machines asms the binary information stored in digital system can be classified as either data or control information data are discrete elements of information binary words that are manipulated by performing arithmetic logic shift and other similar data processing operations these operations are implemented with digital hardware components such as adders decoders multiplexers counters and shift registers control information provides command signals that coordinate and execute the various operations in the data section of the machine in order to accomplish the desired data processing tasks the design of the logic of digital system can be divided into two distinct efforts one part is concerned with designing the digital circuits that perform the data processing operations the other part is concerned with designing the control circuits that determine the sequence in which the various manipulations of data are performed the relationship between the control logic and the data processing operations in digital system is shown in fig the data processing path commonly referred to as the datapath unit manipulates data in registers according to the systems requirements the control unit issues sequence of commands to the datapath unit note that an internal feedback path from the datapath unit to the control unit provides status conditions that the control unit uses together with the external primary inputs to determine the sequence of control signals outputs of the control unit that direct the operation of the datapath unit well see later that understanding how to model this feedback relationship with an hdl is very important the control logic that generates the signals for sequencing the operations in the datapath unit is finite state machine fsm e synchronous sequential circuit the control commands for the system are produced by the fsm as functions of the primary inputs the status signals and the state of the machine in given state the outputs of the controller are the inputs to the datapath unit and determine the operations that it will execute depending on status conditions and other external inputs the fsm goes to its next state to initiate other operations the digital circuits that act as the control logic provide time sequence of signals for initiating the operations in the datapath and also determine the next state of the control subsystem itself input data input control unit control datapath signals fsm signals unit external status signals output data figure control and datapath interaction section algorithmic state machines asms the control sequence and datapath tasks of digital system are specified by means of hardware algorithm an algorithm consists of finite number of procedural steps that specify how to obtain solution to problem hardware algorithm is procedure for solving the problem with given piece of equipment the most challenging and creative part of digital design is the formulation of hardware algorithms for achieving required objectives the goal is to implement the algorithms in silicon as an integrated circuit flowchart is convenient way to specify the sequence of procedural steps and decision paths for an algorithm flowchart for hardware algorithm translates the verbal instructions to an information diagram that enumerates the sequence of operations together with the conditions necessary for their execution an algorithmic state machine asm chart is flowchart that has been developed to specifically define algorithms for execution on digital hardware state machine is another term for sequential circuit which is the basic structure of digital system asm chart an asm chart resembles conventional flowchart but is interpreted somewhat differently conventional flowchart describes the procedural steps and decision paths of an algorithm in sequential manner without taking into consideration their time relationship the asm chart describes the sequence of events e the ordering of events in time as well as the timing relationship between the states of sequential controller and the events that occur while going from one state to the next e the events that are synchronous with changes in the state the chart is adapted to specify accurately the control sequence and datapath operations in digital system taking into consideration the constraints of digital hardware an asm chart is composed of three basic elements the state box the decision box and the conditional box the boxes themselves are connected by directed edges indicating the sequential precedence and evolution of the states as the machine operates there are various ways to attach information to an asm chart in one state in the control sequence is indicated by state box as shown in fig the shape of the state box is rectangle within which are written register operations or the names of output signals that the control generates while being in the indicated state the state is given symbolic name which is placed within the upper left corner of the box the binary code assigned to the state is placed at the upper right corner the state symbol and code can be placed binary code state name pause moore type output signals register operations start op figure asm chart state box in other places as well figure gives an example of state box the state has the symbolic name pause and the binary code assigned to it is inside the box is written the register operation d which indicates that register is to be cleared to name start op inside the box indicates for example moore type output signal that is asserted while the machine is in state pause and that launches certain operation in the datapath unit the style of state box shown in fig is sometimes used in asm charts but it can lead to confusion about when the register operation d is to execute although the operation is written inside the state box it actually occurs when the machine makes transition from pause to its next state in fact writing the register operation within the state box is way albeit possibly confusing to indicate that the controller must assert signal that will cause the register operation to occur when the machine changes state later well introduce chart and notation that are more suited to digital design and that will eliminate any ambiguity about the register operations controlled by state machine the decision box of an asm chart describes the effect of an input e primary or external input or status or internal signal on the control subsystem the box is diamond shaped and has two or more exit paths as shown in fig the input condition to be tested is written inside the box one or the other exit path is taken depending on the evaluation of the condition in the binary case one path is taken if the condition is true and another when the condition is false when an input condition is assigned binary value the two paths are indicated by and respectively the state and decision boxes of an asm chart are similar to those used in conventional flowcharts the third element the conditional box is unique to the asm chart the shape of the conditional box is shown in fig its rounded corners differentiate it from the state box the input path to the conditional box must come from one of the exit paths of decision box the outputs listed inside the conditional box are generated as mealy type signals during given state the register operations listed in the conditional box are associated with transition from the state figure shows an example with conditional box the control generates the output signal start while in state and checks the status of input flag if flag then is cleared to otherwise remains unchanged in either case the next state is register operation is condition exit path exit path exit path figure asm chart decision box section algorithmic state machines asms binary code reset reset state name moore type output signals unconditional register operations start start flag flag condition flush conditional mealy outputs and register g load g operations figure asm chart conditional box and examples associated with we again note that this style of chart can be source of confusion because the state machine does not execute the indicated register operation d when it is in or the operation d gwhen it is in the notation actually indicates that when the controller is in it must assert mealy type signal that will cause the register operation d to execute in the datapath subject to the condition that flag likewise in state the controller must generate moore type output signal that causes the register operation d to execute in the datapath unit the operations in the datapath unit are synchronized to the clock edge that causes the state to move from to and from to respectively thus the control signal generated in given state affects the operation of register in the datapath when the next clock transition occurs the result of the operation is apparent in the next state the asm chart in fig mixes descriptions of the datapath and the controller an asm chart for only the controller is shown in fig in which the register operations are omitted in their place are the control signals that must be generated by the control unit to launch the operations of the datapath unit this chart is useful for describing the controller but it does not contain adequate information about the datapath well address this issue later if the path came from state box the asserted signals would be moore type signals dependent on only the state and should be listed within the box asm block an asm block is structure consisting of one state box and all the decision and conditional boxes connected to its exit path an asm block has one entrance and any number of exit paths represented by the structure of the decision boxes an asm chart consists of one or more interconnected blocks an example of an asm block is given in fig associated with state are two decision boxes and one conditional box the diagram distinguishes the block with dashed lines around the entire structure but this is not usually done since the asm chart uniquely defines each block from its structure state box without any decision or conditional boxes constitutes simple block each block in the asm chart describes the state of the system during one clock pulse interval e the interval between two successive active edges of the clock the operations within the state and conditional boxes in fig are initiated by common clock pulse when the state of the controller transitions from to its next state the same clock pulse transfers the system controller to one of the next states or as dictated by the binary values of and the asm chart for the controller alone is shown in fig the moore type signal incr is asserted unconditionally while the machine is in the mealy type signal clear is generated conditionally when the state is and is asserted in general the moore type outputs of the controller are generated unconditionally and are indicated within state box the mealy type outputs are generated conditionally and are indicated in the conditional boxes connected to the edges that leave decision box the asm chart is similar to state transition diagram each state block is equivalent to state in sequential circuit the decision box is equivalent to the binary information reset reset a incr e clear f figure asm blocks section algorithmic state machines asms ef ef figure state diagram equivalent to the asm chart of fig written along the directed lines that connect two states in state diagram as consequence it is sometimes convenient to convert the chart into state diagram and then use sequential circuit procedures to design the control logic as an illustration the asm chart of fig is drawn as state diagram outputs are omitted in fig the states are symbolized by circles with their binary values written inside the directed lines indicate the conditions that determine the next state the unconditional and conditional operations that must be performed in the datapath unit are not indicated in the state diagram simplifications binary decision box of an asm chart can be simplified by labeling only the edge corresponding to the asserted decision variable and leaving the other edge without label further simplification is to omit the edges corresponding to the state transitions that occur when reset condition is asserted output signals that are not asserted are not shown on the chart the presence of the name of an output signal indicates that it is asserted timing considerations the timing for all registers and flip flops in digital system is controlled by master clock generator the clock pulses are applied not only to the registers of the datapath but also to all the flip flops in the state machine implementing the control unit inputs are also synchronized to the clock because they are normally generated as outputs of another circuit that uses the same clock signals if the input signal changes at an arbitrary time independently of the clock we call it an asynchronous input asynchronous inputs may cause variety of problems to simplify the design we will assume that all inputs are synchronized with the clock and change state in response to an edge transition the major difference between conventional flowchart and an asm chart is in interpreting the time relationship among the various operations for example if fig were conventional flowchart then the operations listed would be considered to follow one after another in sequence first register is incremented and only then is evaluated if then register is cleared and control goes to state otherwise if the next step is to evaluate and go to state or in contrast an asm chart considers the entire block as one unit all the register operations that are specified within clock positive edge of clock present state next state or or figure transition between states the block must occur in synchronism at the edge transition of the same clock pulse while the system changes from to the next state this sequence of events is presented pictorially in fig in this illustration we assume positive edge triggering of all flip flops an asserted asynchronous reset signal reset transfers the control circuit into state while in state the control circuits check inputs and and generate appropriate signals accordingly if reset is not asserted the following operations occur simultaneously at the next positive edge of the clock register is incremented if register is cleared control transfers to the next state as specified in fig note that the two operations in the datapath and the change of state in the control logic occur at the same time note also that the asm chart in fig indicates the register operations that must occur in the datapath unit but does not indicate the control signal that is to be formed by the control unit conversely the chart in fig indicates the control signals but not the datapath operations we will now present an asmd chart to provide the clarity and complete information needed by logic designers asmd chart algorithmic state machine and datapath asmd charts were developed to clarify the information displayed by asm charts and to provide an effective tool for designing control unit for given datapath unit an asmd chart differs from an asm chart in three important ways an asmd chart does not list register operations within state box the edges of an asmd chart are annotated with register operations that are concurrent with the state transition indicated by the edge and an asmd chart includes conditional boxes identifying the signals which control the register operations that annotate the edges of the chart thus an asmd chart associates register operations with state transitions rather than with states it also associates register operations with the signals that cause them consequently an asmd chart represents partition of complex digital machine into its datapath and control units and clearly indicates the relationship between them there is no room for confusion about the timing of register operations or about the signals that launch them designers form an asmd chart in three step process that creates an annotated and completely specified asm chart for the controller of datapath unit section design example asmd chart the steps to form an asmd chart are form an asm chart showing only the states of the controller and the input that cause state transitions convert the asm chart into an asmd chart by annotating the edges of the asm chart to indicate the concurrent register operations of the datapath unit e register operations that are concurrent with state transition and modify the asmd chart to identify the control signals that are generated by the controller and that cause the indicated operations in the datapath unit the asmd chart produced by this process clearly and completely specifies the finite state machine of the controller identifies the registers operations of the datapath unit identifies signals reporting the status of the datapath to the controller and links register operations to the signals that control them one important use of state machine is to control register operations on datapath in sequential machine that has been partitioned into controller and datapath an asmd chart links the asm chart of the controller to the datapath it controls in manner that serves as universal model representing all synchronous digital hardware design asmd charts help clarify the design of sequential machine by separating the design of its datapath from the design of the controller while maintaining clear relationship between the two units register operations that occur concurrently with state transitions are annotated on path of the chart rather than in state boxes or in conditional boxes on the path because these registers are not part of the controller the outputs generated by the controller are the signals that control the registers of the datapath and cause the register operations annotated on the asmd chart design example asmd chart we will now present simple example demonstrating the use of the asmd chart and the register transfer representation we start from the initial specifications of system and proceed with the development of an appropriate asmd chart from which the digital hardware is then designed the datapath unit is to consist of two jk flip flops and and one four bit binary counter individual flip flops in are denoted by and with holding the most significant bit of the count signal start initiates the systems operation by clearing the counter and flip flop at each subsequent clock pulse the counter is incremented by until the operations stop counter bits and determine the sequence of operations if is cleared to and the count continues if is set to then if the count continues but if is set to on the next clock pulse and the system stops counting in general the inputs to the control unit are external primary inputs and status signals that originate in the datapath unit then if start the system remains in the initial state but if start the operation cycle repeats block diagram of the systems architecture is shown in fig with the registers of the datapath unit the external primary input signals the status signals fed back from the datapath unit to the control unit and the control signals generated by the control unit and input to the datapath unit note that the names of the control signals clearly indicate the operations that they cause to be executed in the datapath unit for example clr f clears registers and the name of the signal reset alternatively reset bar indicates that the reset action is active low the internal details of each unit are not shown asmd chart an asmd chart for the system is shown in fig for asynchronous reset action and in fig for synchronous reset action the chart shows the state transitions of the controller and the datapath operations associated with those transitions the chart is not in its final form for it does not identify the control signals generated by the controller the nonblocking verilog operator is shown instead of the arrow for register transfer operations because we will ultimately use the asmd chart to write verilog description of the system when the reset action is synchronous the transition to the reset state is synchronous with the clock this transition is shown for idle in the diagram but all other synchronous reset paths are omitted for clarity the system remains in the reset state idle until start is asserted when that happens e start the state moves to at the next clock edge depending on the values of and decoded in priority order the state returns to or goes to from it moves unconditionally to idle where it awaits another assertion of start the edges of the chart represent the state transitions that occur at the active e synchronizing edge of the clock g the rising edge and are annotated with the register operations that are to occur in the datapath with start asserted in idle the state will transition to and the registers and will be cleared note that on the one hand if register operation is annotated on the edge leaving state box the operation occurs unconditionally and will be controlled by moore type signal for example register is incremented at every clock edge that occurs while the machine is in the state on the other hand the register operation setting register annotates the edge leaving the decision box for the signal controlling the operation will be mealy type signal asserted when the system is in state and has the value likewise the control signal clearing and is asserted conditionally the system is in state idle and start is asserted in addition to showing that the counter is incremented in state the annotated paths show that other operations occur conditionally with the same clock edge either is cleared and control stays in state or is set and control stays in state or is set and control goes to state section design example asmd chart status signals start controller datapath reset clr e clock set f set clr f incr note denotes reset denotes denotes nonblocking assignment reset denotes active low reset condition idle reset s idle reset a start s idle clr f start clr f start incr e a a a e set e f f set figure block diagram for design example asmd chart for controller state transitions asynchronous reset asmd chart for controller state transitions synchronous reset asmd chart for completely specified controller asynchronous reset when control is in state moore type control signal must be asserted to set flip flop to and the state returns to idle at the next active edge of the clock the third and final step in creating the asmd chart is to insert conditional boxes for the signals generated by the controller or to insert moore type signals in the state boxes as shown in fig the signal clr f is generated conditionally in state idle incr is generated unconditionally in clr and set are generated conditionally in and set is generated unconditionally in the asm chart has three states and three blocks the block associated with idle consists of the state box one decision box and one conditional box the block associated with consists of only the state box in addition to clock and reset the control logic has one external input start and two status inputs and in this example we have shown how verbal text description specification of design is translated into an asmd chart that completely describes the controller for the datapath indicating the control signals and their associated register operations this design example does not necessarily have practical application and in general depending on the interpretation the asmd chart produced by the three step design process for the controller may be simplified and formulated differently however once the asmd chart is established the procedure for designing the circuit is straightforward in practice designers use the asmd chart to write verilog models of the controller and the datapath and then synthesize circuit directly from the verilog description we will first design the system manually and then write the hdl description keeping synthesis as an optional step for those who have access to synthesis tools timing sequence every block in an asmd chart specifies the signals which control the operations that are to be initiated by one common clock pulse the control signals specified within the state and conditional boxes in the block are formed while the controller is in the indicated state and the annotated operations occur in the datapath unit when the state makes transition along an edge that exits the state the change from one state to the next is performed in the control logic in order to appreciate the timing relationship involved we will list the step by step sequence of operations after each clock edge beginning with an assertion of the signal start until the system returns to the reset initial state idle table shows the binary values of the counter and the two flip flops after every clock pulse the table also shows separately the status of and as well as the present state of the controller we start with state right after the input signal start has caused the counter and flip flop to be cleared we will assume that the machine had been running before it entered idle instead of entering it from reset condition therefore the value of is assumed to be because is set to when the machine enters before moving to idle as shown at the bottom of the table and because does not change during the transition from idle to the system stays in state during the next clock pulses each pulse increments the counter and either clears or sets note the relationship between the time at which becomes and the time at section design example asmd chart table sequence of operations for design example counter flip flops f conditions state idle which is set to the next clock pulse increments the counter to but that same clock edge sees the value of as so remains cleared the next pulse changes the counter from to and because is equal to before the clock pulse arrives is set to similarly is cleared to not when the count goes from to but when it goes from to which is when is in the present value of the counter when the count reaches both and are equal to the next clock edge increments by sets to and transfers control to state control stays in for only one clock period the clock edge associated with the path leaving sets flip flop to and transfers control to state idle the system stays in the initial state idle as long as start is equal to from an observation of table it may seem that the operations performed on are delayed by one clock pulse this is the difference between an asmd chart and conventional flowchart if fig were conventional flowchart we would assume that is first incremented and the incremented value would have been used to check the status of the operations that are performed in the digital hardware as specified by block in the asmd chart occur during the same clock cycle and not in sequence of operations following each other in time as is the usual interpretation in conventional flowchart thus the value of to be considered in the decision box is taken from the value of the counter in the present state and before it is incremented this is because the decision box for belongs with the same block as state the digital circuits in the control unit generate the signals for all the operations specified in the present block prior to the arrival of the next clock pulse the next clock edge executes all the operations in the registers and flip flops including the flip flops in the controller that determine the next state using the present values of the output signals of the controller thus the signals that control the operations in the datapath unit are formed in the controller in the clock cycle control state preceding the clock edge at which the operations execute controller and datapath hardware design the asmd chart provides all the information needed to design the digital systemthe datapath and the controller the actual boundary between the hardware of the controller and that of the datapath can be arbitrary but we advocate first that the datapath unit contain only the hardware associated with its operations and the logic required perhaps to form status signals used by the controller and second that the control unit contain all of the logic required to generate the signals that control the operations of the datapath unit the requirements for the design of the datapath are indicated by the control signals inside the state and conditional boxes of the asmd chart and are specified by the annotations of the edges indicating datapath operations the control logic is determined from the decision boxes and the required state transitions the hardware configuration of the datapath and controller is shown in fig note that the input signals of the control unit are the external primary inputs start reset and clock and the status signals from the datapath and the status signals provide information about the present condition of the datapath this information together with the primary inputs and information about the present state of the machine is used to form the output of the controller and the value of the next state the outputs of the controller are inputs to the datapath and determine which operations will be executed when the clock undergoes transition note also that the state of the control unit is not an output of the control unit the control subsystem is shown in fig with only its inputs and outputs with names matching those of the asmd chart the detailed design of the controller is considered subsequently the datapath unit consists of four bit binary counter and two jk flip flops the counter is similar to the one shown in fig except that additional internal gates are required for the synchronous clear operation the counter is incremented with every clock pulse when the controller state is it is cleared only when control is at state idle and start is equal to the logic for the signal clr f will be included in the controller and requires an and gate to guarantee that both conditions are present similarly we can anticipate that the controller will use and gates to form signals set and clr depending on whether the controller is in state and whether is asserted set controls flip flop and is asserted unconditionally during state note that all flip flops and registers including the flip flops in the control unit use common clock section design example asmd chart design example controller set start start reset clr clock set clr f incr clock reset datapath jq c counter with jq synchronous clear k figure datapath and controller for design example register transfer representation digital system is represented at the register transfer level by specifying the registers in the system the operations performed and the control sequence the register operations and control information can be specified with an asmd chart it is convenient to separate the control logic from the register operations of the datapath the asmd chart provides this separation and clear sequence of steps to design controller for datapath the control information and register transfer operations can also be represented separately as shown in fig the state diagram specifies the control sequence and the register operations are represented by the register transfer notation introduced in start idle start idle clr f f incr a if then set if then clr s idle set figure register transfer level description of design example section the state transition and the signal controlling the register operation are shown with the operation this representation is an alternative to the representation of the system described in the asmd chart of fig only the asmd chart is really needed but the state diagram for the controller is an alternative representation that is useful in manual design the information for the state diagram is taken directly from the asmd chart the state names are specified in each state box the conditions that cause change of state are specified inside the diamond shaped decision boxes of the asmd chart and are used to annotate the state diagram the directed lines between states and the condition associated with each follow the same path as in the asmd chart the register transfer operations for each of the three states are listed following the name of the state they are taken from the state boxes or the annotated edges of the asmd chart state table the state diagram can be converted into state table from which the sequential circuit of the controller can be designed first we must assign binary values to each state in the asmd chart for flip flops in the control sequential circuit the asmd chart can accommodate up to states chart with or states requires sequential circuit with two flip flops with to states there is need for three flip flops each combination of flip flop values represents binary number for one of the states state table for controller is list of present states and inputs and their corresponding next states and outputs in most cases there are many dont care input conditions section design example asmd chart table state table for the controller of fig present inputs next outputs state state present state set clr symbol start set clr f incr s idle x idle x x x x that must be included so it is advisable to arrange the state table to take those conditions into consideration we assign the following binary values to the three states idle and binary state is not used and will be treated as dont care condition the state table corresponding to the state diagram is shown in table two flip flops are needed and they are labeled and there are three inputs and five outputs the inputs are taken from the conditions in the decision boxes the outputs depend on the inputs and the present state of the control note that there is row in the table for each possible transition between states initial state goes to state or stays in depending on the value of input start the other two inputs are marked with dont care xs as they do not determine the next state in this case while the system is in binary state with start the control unit provides an output labeled clr f to initiate the required register operations the transition from binary state depends on inputs and the system goes to binary state only if otherwise it remains in binary state finally binary state goes to independently of the input variables control logic the procedure for designing sequential circuit starting from state table was presented in chapter if this procedure is applied to table we need to use five variable maps to simplify the input equations this is because there are five variables listed under the present state and input columns of the table instead of using maps to simplify the input equations we can obtain them directly from the state table by inspection to design the sequential circuit of the controller with flip flops it is necessary to go over the next state columns in the state table and derive all the conditions that must set each flip flop to from table we note that the next state column of has single in the fifth row the input of flip flop must be equal to during present state when both inputs and are equal to this condition is expressed with the flip flop input equation similarly the next state column of has four and the condition for setting this flip flop is start idle to derive the five output functions we can exploit the fact that binary state is not used which simplifies the equation for clr f and enables us to obtain the following simplified set of output equations set clr set clr f start idle incr the logic diagram showing the internal detail of the controller of fig is drawn in fig note that although we derived the output equations from table they can also be obtained directly by inspection of fig this simple example illustrates the start clr f incr c set set clr d clock reset figure logic diagram of the control unit for fig section hdl description of design example manual design of controller for datapath using an asmd chart as starting point the fact that synthesis tools automatically execute these steps should be appreciated hdl description of design example in previous chapters we gave examples of hdl descriptions of combinational circuits sequential circuits and various standard components such as multiplexers counters and registers we are now in position to incorporate these components into the description of specific design as mentioned previously design can be described either at the structural or behavioral level behavioral descriptions may be classified as being either at the register transfer level or at an abstract algorithmic level consequently we now consider three levels of design structural description rtl description and algorithmic based behavioral description the structural description is the lowest and most detailed level the digital system is specified in terms of the physical components and their interconnection the various components may include gates flip flops and standard circuits such as multiplexers and counters the design is hierarchically decomposed into functional units and each unit is described by an hdl module top level module combines the entire system by instantiating all the lower level modules this style of description requires that the designer have sufficient experience not only to understand the functionality of the system but also to implement it by selecting and connecting other functional elements the rtl description specifies the digital system in terms of the registers the operations performed and the control that sequences the operations this type of description simplifies the design process because it consists of procedural statements that determine the relationship between the various operations of the design without reference to any specific structure the rtl description implies certain hardware configuration among the registers allowing the designer to create design that can be synthesized automatically rather than manually into standard digital components the algorithmic based behavioral description is the most abstract level describing the function of the design in procedural algorithmic form similar to programming language it does not provide any detail on how the design is to be implemented with hardware the algorithmic based behavioral description is most appropriate for simulating complex systems in order to verify design ideas and explore trade offs descriptions at this level are accessible to nontechnical users who understand programming languages some algorithms however might not be synthesizable we will now illustrate the rtl and structural descriptions by using the design example of the previous section the design example will serve as model of coding style for future examples and will exploit alternative syntax options supported by revisions to the verilog language an algorithmic based description is illustrated in section rtl description the block diagram in fig describes the design example an hdl description of the design example can be written as single rtl description in verilog module or as top level module having instantiations of separate modules for the controller and the datapath the former option simply ignores the boundaries between the functional units the modules in the latter option establish the boundaries shown in fig and fig we advocate the second option because in general it distinguishes more clearly between the controller and the datapath this choice also allows one to easily substitute alternative controllers for given datapath g replace an rtl model by structural model the rtl description of the design example is shown in hdl example the description follows the asmd chart of fig which contains complete description of the controller the datapath and the interface between them e the outputs of the controller and the status signals likewise our description has three modules design example rtl controller rtl and datapath rtl the descriptions of the controller and the datapath units are taken directly from fig design example rtl declares the input and output ports of the module and instantiates controller rtl and datapath rtl at this stage of the description it is important to remember to declare as vector failure to do so will produce port mismatch errors when the descriptions are compiled together note that the status signals and but not and are passed to the controller the primary external inputs to the controller are start clock to synchronize the system and reset the active low input signal reset is needed to initialize the state of the controller to idle without that signal the controller could not be placed in known initial state the controller is described by three cyclic always behaviors an edge sensitive behavior updates the state at the positive edge of the clock depending on whether reset condition is asserted two level sensitive behaviors describe the combinational logic for the next state and the outputs of the controller as specified by the asmd chart notice that the description includes default assignments to all of the outputs g set this approach allows the code of the case logic to be simplified by expressing only explicit assertions of the variables e values are assigned by exception the approach also ensures that every path through the assignment logic assigns value to every variable thus synthesis tool will interpret the logic to be combinational failure to assign value to every variable on every path of logic implies the need for transparent latch memory to implement the logic synthesis tools will provide the latch wasting silicon area the three states of the controller are given symbolic names and are encoded into binary values only three of the possible two bit patterns are used so the case statement for the next state logic includes default assignment to handle the possibility that one of the three assigned codes is not detected the alternative is to allow the hardware to make an arbitrary assignment to the next state next state also the first statement of the next state logic assigns next state idle to guarantee that the next state is assigned in every thread of the logic this is precaution against accidentally forgetting to make an assignment to the next state in every thread of the logic with the result that the description implies the need for memory which synthesis tool will implement with transparent latch the description of datapath rtl is written by testing for an assertion of each control signal from controller rtl the register transfer operations are displayed in section hdl description of design example the asmd chart fig note that nonblocking assignments are used with symbol for the register transfer operations this ensures that the register operations and state transitions are concurrent feature that is especially crucial during control state in this state is incremented by and the value of is checked to determine the operation to execute at register at the next clock to accomplish valid synchronous design it is necessary to ensure that is checked before is incremented if blocking assignments were used one would have to place the two statements that check first and the statement that increments last however by using nonblocking assignments we accomplish the required synchronization without being concerned about the order in which the statements are listed the counter in datapath rtl is cleared synchronously because clr f is synchronized to the clock the cyclic behaviors of the controller and the datapath interact in chain reaction at the active edge of the clock the state and datapath registers are updated change in the state primary input or status input causes the level sensitive behaviors of the controller to update the value of the next state and the outputs the updated values are used at the next active edge of the clock to determine the state transition and the updates of the datapath note that the manual method of design developed block diagram fig showing the interface between the datapath and the controller an asmd chart for the system fig the logic equations for the inputs to the flip flops of the controller and circuit that implements the controller fig in contrast an rtl model describes the state transitions of the controller and the operations of the datapath as step toward automatically synthesizing the circuit that implements them the descriptions of the datapath and controller are derived directly from the asmd chart in both cases hdl example rtl description of design example see fig module design example rtl start clock reset specify ports of the top level module of the design see block diagram fig output output

section table shows the values of and while register is incremented it is instructive to devise test that checks the circuit to verify the validity of the hdl description the test bench in hdl example provides such module the procedure for writing test benches is explained in section the test module generates signals for start clock and reset and checks the results obtained from registers and initially the reset signal is set to to initialize the controller and start and clock are set to at time the reset signal is de asserted by setting it to the start input is asserted by setting it to and the clock is then repeated for cycles the monitor statement displays the values of and every ns the output of the simulation is listed in the example under the simulation log initially at time the values of the registers are unknown so they are marked with the symbol the first positive clock transition at time clears and but does not affect so is unknown at this time the rest of the table is identical to table note that since start is still equal to at time the last entry in the table shows that and are cleared to and does not change and remains at this occurs during the second transition

values are shown in hexadecimal format the results are annotated to call attention to the relationship between control signal and the operation that it causes to execute for example the controller asserts set for one clock cycle before the clock edge at which is set to likewise set asserts during the clock cycle before the edge at which is set to also clr f is formed in the cycle before and are cleared more thorough verification of design example rtl would confirm that the machine recovers from reset on the fly e reset that is asserted randomly after the machine is operating note that the signals in the output of the simulation have been listed in groups showing clock and reset start and the status inputs the state the control signals and the datapath registers it is strongly recommended that the state always be displayed because this information is essential for verifying that the machine is operating correctly and for debugging its description when it is not for the chosen binary state code idle and structural description the rtl description of design consists of procedural statements that determine the functional behavior of the digital circuit this type of description can be compiled by section hdl description of design example name clock reset start clr f set clr set incr e figure simulation results for design example rtl hdl synthesis tools from which it is possible to obtain the equivalent gate level circuit of the design it is also possible to describe the design by its structure rather than its function structural description of design consists of instantiations of components that define the circuit elements and their interconnections in this regard structural description is equivalent to schematic diagram or block diagram of the circuit contemporary design practice relies heavily on rtl descriptions but we will present structural description here to contrast the two approaches for convenience the circuit is again decomposed into two parts the controller and the datapath the block diagram of fig shows the high level partition between these units and fig provides additional underlying structural details of the controller the structure of the datapath is evident in fig and consists of the flip flops and the four bit counter with synchronous clear the top level of the verilog description replaces design example rtl controller rtl and datapath rtl by design example str controller str and datapath str respectively the descriptions of controller str and datapath str will be structural hdl example presents the structural description of the design example it consists of nested hierarchy of modules and gates describing the top level module design example str the modules describing the controller and the datapath the modules describing the flip flops and counters and gates implementing the logic of the controller for simplicity the counter and flip flops are described by rtl models the top level module see fig encapsulates the entire design by instantiating the controller and the datapath modules declaring the primary external input signals declaring the output signals declaring the control signals generated by the controller and connected to the datapath unit and declaring the status signals generated by the datapath unit and connected to the controller the port list is identical to the list used in the rtl description the outputs are declared as wire type here because they serve merely to connect the outputs of the datapath module to the outputs of the top level module with their logic value being determined within the datapath module the control module describes the circuit of fig outputs of the two flip flops and are declared as wire data type and cannot be declared as reg data type because they are outputs of an instantiated flip flop and are undeclared identifiers e implicit wires the name of variable is local to the module or procedural block in which it is declared nets may not be declared within procedural block g begin end the rule to remember is that variable must be declared register type g reg if and only if its value is assigned by procedural statement e blocking or nonblocking assignment statement within procedural block in cyclic or single pass behavior or in the output of sequential udp the instantiated gates specify the combinational part of the circuit there are two flip flop input equations and three output equations the outputs of the flip flops and and the input equations and replace output and input in the instantiated flip flops the flip flop is then described in the next module the structure of the datapath unit has direct inputs to the jk flip flops note the correspondence between the modules of the hdl description and the

tested with the test bench that verified the rtl description to produce the results shown in fig only change necessary is the replacement of the instantiation of the example from design example rtl by design example str the simulation results for design example str matched those for design example rtl however comparison of the two descriptions indicates that the rtl style is easier section sequential binary multiplier to write and will lead to results faster if synthesis tools are available to automatically synthesize the registers the combinational logic and their interconnections sequential binary multiplier this section introduces second design example it presents hardware algorithm for binary multiplication proposes the register configuration for its implementation and then shows how to use an asmd chart to design its datapath and its controller the system we will examine multiplies two unsigned binary numbers the hardware developed in section to execute multiplication resulted in combinational circuit multiplier with many adders and and gates and requires large area of silicon as an integrated circuit in contrast in this section more efficient hardware algorithm results in sequential multiplier that uses only one adder and shift register the savings in hardware and silicon area come about from trade off in the space hardware ctime domain parallel adder uses more hardware but forms its result in one cycle of the clock sequential adder uses less hardware but takes multiple clock cycles to form its result the multiplication of two binary numbers is done with paper and pencil by successive e sequential additions and shifting the process is best illustrated with numerical example let us multiply the two binary numbers and multiplican multiplier product the process consists of successively adding and shifting copies of the multiplicand successive bits of the multiplier are examined least significant bit first if the multiplier bit is the multiplicand is copied down otherwise are copied down the numbers copied in successive lines are shifted one position to the left from the previous number finally the numbers are added and their sum forms the product the product obtained from the multiplication of two binary numbers of bits each can have up to bits it is apparent that the operations of addition and shifting are executed by the algorithm when the multiplication process is implemented with digital hardware it is convenient to change the process slightly first we note that in the context of synthesizing sequential machine the add and shift algorithm for binary multiplication can be executed in single clock cycle or over multiple clock cycles choice to form the product in the time span of single clock cycle will synthesize the circuit of parallel multiplier like the one discussed in section on the other hand an rtl model of the algorithm adds shifted copies of the multiplicand to an accumulated partial product the values of the multiplier multiplicand and partial product are stored in registers and the operations of shifting and adding their contents are executed under the control of state machine among the many possibilities for distributing the effort of multiplication over multiple clock cycles we will consider that in which only one partial product is formed and accumulated in single cycle of the clock one alternative would be to use additional hardware to form and accumulate two partial products in clock cycle but this would require more logic gates and either faster circuits or slower clock instead of providing digital circuits to store and add simultaneously as many binary numbers as there are in the multiplier it is less expensive to provide only the hardware needed to sum two binary numbers and accumulate the partial products in register second instead of shifting the multiplicand to the left the partial product being formed is shifted to the right this leaves the partial product and the multiplicand in the required relative positions third when the corresponding bit of the multiplier is there is no need to add all to the partial product since doing so will not alter its resulting value register configuration block diagram for the sequential binary multiplier is shown in fig and the register configuration of the datapath is shown in fig the multiplicand is stored in register the multiplier is stored in register and the partial product is formed in register and stored in and parallel adder adds the contents of register to register the flip flop stores the carry after the addition the counter is initially set to hold binary number equal to the number of bits in the multiplier this counter is decremented after the formation of each partial product when the content of the counter reaches zero the product is formed in the double register and and the process stops the control logic stays in an initial state until start becomes the system then performs the multiplication the sum of and forms the most significant bits of the partial product which is transferred to the output carry from the addition whether or is transferred to both the partial product in and the multiplier in are shifted to the right the least significant bit of is shifted into the most significant position of the carry from is shifted into the most significant position of and is shifted into after the shift right operation one bit of the partial product is transferred into while the multiplier bits in are shifted one position to the right in this manner the least significant bit of register designated by holds the bit of the multiplier that must be inspected next the control logic determines whether to add or not on the basis of this input bit the control logic also receives signal zero from circuit that checks counter for zero and zero are status inputs for the control unit the input signal start is an external control input the outputs of the control logic launch the required operations in the registers of the datapath unit section sequential binary multiplier ready multiplicand multiplier load regs datapath shift regs add regs decr b start controller c reset clock product zero register multiplicand register counter register sum register multiplier figure block diagram and datapath of binary multiplier the interface between the controller and the datapath consists of the status signals and the output signals of the controller the control signals govern the synchronous register operations of the datapath signal load regs loads the internal registers of the datapath shift regs causes the shift register to shift add regs forms the sum of the multiplicand and register and decr decrements the counter the controller also forms output ready to signal to the host environment that the machine is ready to multiply the contents of the register holding the product vary during execution so it is useful to have signal indicating that its contents are valid note again that the state of the control is not an interface signal between the control unit and the datapath only the signals needed to control the datapath are included in the interface putting the state in the interface would require decoder in the datapath and would require wider and more active bus than the control signals alone not good asmd chart the asmd chart for the binary multiplier is shown in fig the intermediate form in fig annotates the asm chart of the controller with the register operations and the completed chart in fig identifies the moore and mealy outputs of the controller initially the multiplicand is in and the multiplier in as long as the circuit is in the initial state and start no action occurs and the system remains in state idle with ready asserted the multiplication process is launched when start then control goes to state add register and carry flip flop are cleared to registers reset reset s idle ready s idle multiplicand start

one bit figure asmd chart for binary multiplier section sequential binary multiplier and are loaded with the multiplicand and the multiplier respectively and the sequence counter is set to binary number equal to the number of bits in the multiplier in state add the multiplier bit in is checked and if it is equal to the multiplicand in is added to the partial product in the carry from the addition is transferred to the partial product in and is left unchanged if the counter is decremented by regardless of the value of so decr is formed in state add as moore output of the controller in both cases the next state is shift registers and are combined into one composite register caq denoted by the concatenation and its contents are shifted once to the right to obtain new partial product this shift operation is symbolized in the flowchart with the verilog logical right shift operator it is equivalent to the following statement in register transfer notation shift right caq d in terms of individual register symbols the shift operation can be described by the following register operations d shr c d shr both registers and are shifted right the leftmost bit of designated by receives the carry from the leftmost bit of receives the bit from the rightmost position of in and is reset to in essence this is long shift of the composite register caq with inserted into the serial input which is at the value in counter is checked after the formation of each partial product if the contents of are different from zero status bit zero is set equal to and the process is repeated to form new partial product the process stops when the counter reaches and the controllers status input zero is equal to note that the partial product formed in is shifted into one bit at time and eventually replaces the multiplier the final product is available in and with holding the most significant bits and the least significant bits of the product the previous numerical example is repeated in table to clarify the multiplication process the procedure follows the steps outlined in the asmd chart the data shown in the table can be compared with simulation results the type of registers needed for the data processor subsystem can be derived from the register operations listed in the asmd chart register is shift register with parallel load to accept the sum from the adder and must have synchronous clear capability to reset the register to register is shift register the counter is binary down counter with facility to parallel load binary constant the flip flop must be designed to accept the input carry and have synchronous clear registers and need parallel load capability in order to receive the multiplicand and multiplier prior to the start of the multiplication process table multiplier numerical example for binary multiplier a p multiplicand multiplier in add first partial product shift right caq add second partial product shift right caq shift right caq shift right caq add fifth partial product shift right caq final product in aq control logic the design of digital system can be divided into two parts the design of the register transfers in the datapath unit and the design of the control logic of the control unit the control logic is finite state machine its mealy and moore type outputs control the operations of the datapath the inputs to the control unit are the primary external inputs and the internal status signals fed back from the datapath to the controller the design of the system can be synthesized from an rtl description derived from the asmd chart alternatively manual design must derive the logic governing the inputs to the flip flops holding the state of the controller the information needed to form the state diagram of the controller is already contained in the asmd chart since the rectangular blocks that designate state boxes are the states of the sequential circuit the diamond shaped blocks that designate decision boxes determine the logical conditions for the next state transition in the state diagram and assertions of the conditional outputs as an example the control state diagram for the binary multiplier developed in the previous section is shown in fig information for the diagram is taken directly from the asmd chart of fig the three states idle through shift are taken from the rectangular state boxes the inputs start and zero are taken from the diamond shaped decision boxes the register transfer operations for each of the three states are listed in fig and are taken from the corresponding state and conditional boxes in the asmd chart establishing the state transitions is the initial focus so the outputs of the controller are not shown section control logic zero start idle start add shift zero state transition register operations from to initial state idle c dp width idle add s add shift if then a cout shift shift right caq figure control specifications for binary multiplier we must execute two steps when implementing the control logic establish the required sequence of states and provide signals to control the register operations the sequence of states is specified in the asmd chart or the state diagram the signals for controlling the operations in the registers are specified in the register transfer statements annotated on the asmd chart or listed in tabular format for the multiplier these signals are load regs for parallel loading the registers in the datapath unit decr for decrementing the counter add regs for adding the multiplicand and the partial product and shift regs for shifting register caq the block diagram of the control unit is shown in fig the inputs to the controller are start and zero and the outputs are ready load regs decr add regs and shift regs as specified in the asmd chart we note that affects only the output of the controller not its state transitions the machine transitions from add to shift unconditionally an important step in the design is the assignment of coded binary values to the states the simplest assignment is the sequence of binary numbers as shown in table another assignment is the gray code according to which only one bit changes when going from one number to the next state assignment often used in control design is the one hot assignment this assignment uses as many bits and flip flops as there are states in the circuit at any given time only one bit is equal to the one that is hot table state assignment for control state binary gray code one hot idle add shift while all others are kept at all cold this type of assignment uses flip flop for each state indeed one hot encoding uses more flip flops than other types of coding but it usually leads to simpler decoding logic for the next state and the output of the machine because the decoding logic does not become more complex as states are added to the machine the speed at which the machine can operate is not limited by the time required to decode the state since the controller is sequential circuit it can be designed manually by the sequential logic procedure outlined in chapter however in most cases this method is difficult to carry out manually because of the large number of states and inputs that typical control circuit may have as consequence it is necessary to use specialized methods for control logic design that may be considered as variations of the classical sequential logic method we will now present two such design procedures one uses sequence register and decoder and the other uses one flip flop per state the method will be presented for small circuit but it applies to larger circuits as well of course the need for these methods is eliminated if one has software that automatically synthesizes the circuit from an hdl description sequence register and decoder the sequence register and decoder manual method as the name implies uses register for the control states and decoder to provide an output corresponding to each of the states the decoder is not needed if one hot code is used register with flip flops can have up to states and an to line decoder has up to outputs an bit sequence register is essentially circuit with flip flops together with the associated gates that effect their state transitions the asmd chart and the state diagram for the controller of the binary multiplier have three states and two inputs there is no need to consider to implement the design with sequence register and decoder we need two flip flops for the register and two to four line decoder the outputs of the decoder will form the moore type outputs of the controller directly the mealy type outputs will be formed from the moore outputs and the inputs the state table for the finite state machine of the controller is shown in table it is derived directly from the asmd chart of fig or the state diagram of fig we designate the two flip flops as and and assign the binary states and to idle add and shift respectively note that the input columns have dont care entries whenever the input variable is not used to determine the next table inputs section control logic state table for control circuit next present state state present state ready load regs symbol start zero decr add regs shift regs idle x idle add x add shift x shift x x x state the outputs of the control circuit are designated by the names given in the asmd chart the particular moore type output variable that is equal to at any given time is determined from the equivalent binary value of the present state those output variables are shaded in table thus when the present state is output ready must be equal to while the other outputs remain at since the moore type outputs are function of only the present state they can be generated with decoder circuit having the two inputs and and using three of the decoder outputs through as shown in fig which does not include the wiring for the state feedback the state machine of the controller can be designed from the state table by means of the classical procedure presented in chapter this example has small number of states and inputs so we could use maps to simplify the boolean functions in most control logic applications the number of states and inputs is much larger in general the application of the classical method requires an excessive amount of work to obtain the simplified input equations for the flip flops and is prone to error the design can be simplified if we take into consideration the fact that the decoder outputs are available for use in the design instead of using flip flop outputs as the present state conditions we use the outputs of the decoder to indicate the present state condition of the sequential circuit moreover instead of using maps to simplify the flip flop equations we can obtain them directly by inspection of the state table for example from the next state conditions in the state table we find that the next state of is equal to when the present state is add and is equal to when the present state is idle or shift these conditions can be specified by the equation where is the input of flip flop similarly the input of is start zero start next state ready logic idle load regs zero add regs decr decoder shift regs add shift clock reset next state logic start idle ready load regs zero add regs add decr decoder shift regs shift c clock reset figure logic diagram of control for binary multiplier using sequence register and decoder section control logic when deriving input equations by inspection from the state table we cannot be sure that the boolean functions have been simplified in the best possible way synthesis tools take care of this detail automatically in general it is advisable to analyze the circuit to ensure that the equations derived do indeed produce the required state transitions the logic diagram of the control circuit is drawn in fig it consists of register with two flip flops and and decoder the outputs of the decoder are used to generate the inputs to the next state logic as well as the control outputs the outputs of the controller should be connected to the datapath to activate the required register operations one hot design one flip flop per state another method of control logic design is the one hot assignment which results in sequential circuit with one flip flop per state only one of the flip flops contains at any time all others are reset to the single propagates from one flip flop to another under the control of decision logic in such configuration each flip flop represents state that is present only when the control bit is transferred to it this method uses the maximum number of flip flops for the sequential circuit for example sequential circuit with states requires minimum of four flip flops by contrast with the method of one flip flop per state the circuit requires flip flops one for each state at first glance it may seem that this method would increase system cost since more flip flops are used but the method offers some advantages that may not be apparent one advantage is the simplicity with which the logic can be designed by inspection of the asmd chart or the state diagram no state or excitation tables are needed if type flip flops are employed the one hot method offers savings in design effort an increase in operational simplicity and possible decrease in the total number of gates since decoder is not needed the design procedure for one hot state assignment will be demonstrated by obtaining the control circuit specified by the state diagram of fig since there are three states in the state diagram we choose three flip flops and label their outputs and corresponding to idle add and shift respectively the input equations for setting each flip flop to are determined from the present state and the input conditions along the corresponding directed lines going into the state for example the input to flip flop is set to if the machine is in state and start is not asserted or if the machine is in state and zero is asserted these conditions are specified by the input equation start zero in fact the condition for setting flip flop to is obtained directly from the state diagram from the condition specified in the directed lines going into the corresponding flip flop state anded with the previous flip flop state if there is more than one directed line going into state all conditions must be ored using this procedure for the other three flip flops we obtain the remaining input equations start zero start set ready idle load regs zero add regs decr d add rst shift regs shift clock reset rst figure logic diagram for one hot state controller the logic diagram of the one hot controller with one flip flop per state is shown in fig the circuit consists of three flip flops labeled through together with the associated gates specified by the input equations initially flip flop must be set to and all other flip flops must be reset to so that the flip flop representing the initial state is enabled this can be done by using an asynchronous preset on flip flop and an asynchronous clear for the other flip flops once started the controller with one flip flop per state will propagate from one state to the other in the proper manner only one flip flop will be set to with each clock edge all others are reset to because their inputs are equal to hdl description of binary multiplier second example of an hdl description of an rtl design is given in hdl example the binary multiplier designed in section for simplicity the entire description is flattened and encapsulated in one module comments will identify the controller and the datapath the first part of the description declares all of the inputs and outputs as specified section hdl description of binary multiplier in the block diagram of fig machine will be parameterized for five bit datapath to enable comparison between its simulation data and the result of the multiplication with the numerical example listed in table same model can be used for datapath having different size merely by changing the value of the parameters the second part of the description declares all registers in the controller and the datapath as well as the one hot encoding of the states the third part specifies implicit combinational logic continuous assignment statements for the concatenated register caq the zero status signal and the ready output signal the continuous assignments for zero and ready are accomplished by assigning boolean expression to their wire declarations the next section describes the control unit using single edge sensitive cyclic behavior to describe the state transitions and level sensitive cyclic behavior to describe the combinational logic for the next state and the outputs again note that default assignments are made to next state load regs decr add regs and shift regs the subsequent logic of the case statement assigns their value by exception the state transitions and the output logic are written directly from the asmd chart of fig the datapath unit describes the register operations within separate edge sensitive cyclic for clarity separate cyclic behaviors are used we do not mix the description of the datapath with the description of the controller each control input is decoded and is used to specify the associated operations the addition and subtraction operations will be implemented in hardware by combinational logic signal load regs causes the counter and the other registers to be loaded with their initial values etc because the controller and datapath have been partitioned into separate units the control signals completely specify the behavior of the datapath explicit information about the state of the controller is not needed and is not made available to the datapath unit the next state logic of the controller includes default case item to direct synthesis tool to map any of the unused codes to idle the default case item and the default assignments preceding the case statement ensure that the machine will recover if it somehow enters an unused state they also prevent unintentional synthesis of latches remember synthesis tool will synthesize latches when what was intended to be combinational logic in fact fails to completely specify the inputcoutput

in the block diagram of fig it is naive to conclude that an hdl description of system is correct on the basis of the output it generates under the application of few input signals more strategic approach to testing and verification exploits the partition of the design into its datapath and control unit this partition supports separate verification of the controller and the datapath separate test bench can be developed to verify that the datapath executes each operation and generates status signals correctly after the datapath unit is verified the next step is to verify that each control signal is formed correctly by the control unit separate test bench can verify that the control unit exhibits the complete functionality specified by the asmd chart e that it makes the correct state transitions and asserts its outputs in response to the external inputs and the status signals verified control unit and verified datapath unit together do not guarantee that the system will operate correctly the final step in the design process is to integrate the verified models within parent module and verify the functionality of the overall machine the interface between the controller and the datapath must be examined in order to verify that the ports are connected correctly for example mismatch in the listed order of signals may not be detected by the compiler after the datapath unit and the control unit have been verified third test bench should verify the specified functionality of the complete system in practice this requires writing comprehensive test plan identifying that functionality for example the test plan would identify the need to verify that the sequential multiplier asserts the signal ready in state idle the exercise to write test plan is not academic the quality and scope of the test plan determine the worth of the verification effort the test plan guides the development of the test bench and increases the likelihood that the final design will match its specification testing and verifying an hdl model usually requires access to more information than the inputs and outputs of the machine knowledge of the state of the control unit the control signals the status signals and the internal registers of the datapath might all be necessary for debugging fortunately verilog provides mechanism to hierarchically de reference identifiers so that any variable at any level of the design hierarchy can be visible to the test bench procedural statements can display the information required to support efforts to debug the machine simulators use this mechanism to display waveforms of any variable in the design hierarchy to use the mechanism we reference the variable by its hierarchical path name for example the register within the datapath unit is not an output port of the multiplier but it can be referenced as the hierarchical path name consists of the sequence of module identifiers or block names separated by periods and specifying the location of the variable in the design hierarchy we also note that simulators commonly have graphical user interface that displays all levels of the hierarchy of design the first test bench in hdl example uses the system task strobe to display the result of the computations this task is similar to the display and monitor tasks explained in section the strobe system task provides synchronization mechanism to ensure that data are displayed only after all assignments in given time step are executed this is very useful in synchronous sequential circuits where the time step begins at clock edge and multiple assignments may occur at the same time step of simulation when the system is synchronized to the positive edge of the clock using strobe after the always posedge clock statement ensures that the display shows values of the signal after the clock pulse the test bench module sequential binary multiplier in hdl example instantiates the module sequential binary multiplier of hdl example both modules must be included as source files when simulating the multiplier with verilog hdl simulator the result of this simulation displays simulation log with numbers identical to the ones in table the code includes second test bench to exhaustively multiply five bit values of the multiplicand and the multiplier waveforms for sample of simulation results are shown in fig the numerical values of multiplicand multiplier and product are displayed in decimal and hexadecimal formats insight can be gained by studying the displayed waveforms of the control state the control signals the

behavioral description of parallel multiplier structural modeling implicitly specifies the functionality of digital machine by prescribing an interconnection of gate level hardware units in this form of modeling synthesis tool performs boolean optimization and translates the hdl description of circuit into netlist of gates in particular technology g cmos hardware design at this level often requires cleverness and accrued experience it is the most tedious and detailed form of modeling in contrast behavioral rtl modeling specifies functionality abstractly in terms of hdl operators the rtl model does not specify gate level implementation of the registers or the logic to control the operations that manipulate their contentsthose tasks are accomplished by synthesis tool rtl modeling implicitly schedules operations by explicitly assigning them to clock cycles the most abstract form of behavioral modeling describes only an algorithm without any reference to physical implementation set of resources or schedule for their use thus algorithmic modeling allows designer to explore trade offs in the space hardware and time domains trading processing speed for hardware complexity hdl example presents an rtl model and an algorithmic model of binary multiplier both use level sensitive cyclic behavior the rtl model expresses the functionality of multiplier in single statement synthesis tool will associate with the multiplication operator gate level circuit equivalent to that shown in section in simulation when either the multiplier or the multiplicand changes the product will be updated the time required to form the product will depend on the propagation delays of the gates available in the library of standard cells used by the synthesis tool the second model is an algorithmic description of the multiplier synthesis tool will unroll the loop of the algorithm and infer the need for gate level circuit equivalent to that shown in section be aware that synthesis tool may not be able to synthesize given algorithmic description even though the associated hdl model will simulate and produce correct results one difficulty is that the sequence of operations implied by an algorithm might not be physically realizable in single clock cycle it then becomes necessary to distribute the operations over multiple clock cycles tool for synthesizing rtl logic will not be able to automatically accomplish the required distribution of effort but tool that hdl example behavioral rtl description of parallel multiplier module mult product multiplicand multiplier

multiplication if only single adder is to be shared by all of the operations that form partial sum the activity must be distributed over multiple clock cycles and in the correct sequence ultimately leading to the sequential binary multiplier for which we have explicitly designed the controller for its datapath behavioral synthesis tools require different and more sophisticated style of modeling and are not within the scope of this text design with multiplexers the register and decoder scheme for the design of controller has three parts the flip flops that hold the binary state value the decoder that generates the control outputs and the gates that determine the next state and output signals in section it was shown that combinational circuit can be implemented with multiplexers instead of individual gates replacing the gates with multiplexers results in regular pattern of three levels of components the first level consists of multiplexers that determine the next state of the register the second level contains register that holds the present binary state the third level has decoder that asserts unique output line for each control state these three components are predefined standard cells in many integrated circuits consider for example the asm chart of fig consisting of four states and four control inputs we are interested in only the control signals governing the state sequence these signals are independent of the register operations of the datapath so the edges of the graph are not annotated with datapath register operations and the graph does not identify the output signals of the controller the binary assignment for each state is indicated at the upper right corner of the state boxes the decision boxes specify the state transitions as function of the four control inputs and the three level control implementation shown in fig consists of two multiplexers and register with two flip flops and decoder with four and corresponding to and respectively the outputs of the state register flip flops are applied to the decoder inputs and also to the select inputs of the multiplexers in this way the present state of the register is used to select one of the inputs from each multiplexer the outputs of the multiplexers are then applied to the inputs of and the purpose of each multiplexer is to produce an input to its corresponding flip flop equal to the binary value of that bit of the next state vector the inputs of the multiplexers x y z figure example of asm chart with four control inputs are determined from the decision boxes and state transitions given in the asm chart for example state stays at or goes to depending on the value of input since the next state of is in either case we place signal equivalent to logic in input the next state of is if and if since the next state of is equal to we apply control input to input this means that when the select inputs of the multiplexers are equal to present state the outputs of the multiplexers provide the binary value that is transferred to the register at the next clock pulse section design with multiplexers c y mux select decoder w x z clk figure control implementation with multiplexers to facilitate the evaluation of the multiplexer inputs we prepare table showing the input conditions for each possible state transition in the asm chart table gives this information for the asm chart of fig there are two transitions from present state or and three from present state or the sets of transitions are separated by horizontal lines across the table the input conditions listed in the table are obtained from the decision boxes in the asm chart for example from fig we note that present state will go to next state if or to next state if in the table we mark these input conditions as and respectively the two columns under multiplexer inputs in the table specify the input values that must be applied to and the multiplexer input for each present state is determined from the input conditions when the next state of the flip flop is equal to thus after present state the next state of is always equal to and the next state of is equal to the complement of therefore the input of is made equal to and that of to xwhen the present state of the register is as another example after present state the next state of must be equal to if the input conditions are yz or yz when these two boolean terms are ored together and then simplified we obtain the single binary variable as indicated in the table the next state of is equal to if the input conditions are yz if the next state of remains at after given present state we place in the multiplexer input as shown in present state for table multiplexer input conditions present next input inputs state state condition x w x y yz yz yz yz yz yz yz yz yz yz if the next state of is always we place in the multiplexer input as shown in present state for the other entries for and are derived in similar manner the multiplexer inputs from the table are then used in the control implementation of fig note that if the next state of flip flop is function of two or more control variables the multiplexer may require one or more gates in its input otherwise the multiplexer input is equal to the control variable the complement of the control variable or design example count the number of ones in register we will demonstrate the multiplexer implementation of the logic for control unit by means of design examplea system that is to count the number of in word of data the example will also demonstrate the formulation of the asmd chart and the implementation of the datapath subsystem from among various alternatives we will consider ones counter consisting of two registers and and flip flop more efficient implementation is considered in the problems at the end of the chapter the system counts the number of in the number loaded into register and sets register to that number for example if the binary number loaded into is the circuit counts the five in and sets register to the binary count this is done by shifting each bit from register one at time into flip flop the value in is checked by the control and each time it is equal to register is incremented by the block diagram of the datapath and controller are shown in fig the datapath contains registers and as well as logic to shift the leftmost bit of into the unit also contains logic nor gate to detect whether is but that status data signals zero datapath load regs shift left start controller shift left ready reset clock count reset reset s idle data idle data ready all ready all start start load regs zero zero shift left figure block diagram and asmd chart for count of ones circuit detail is omitted in the figure the external input signal start launches the operation of the machine ready indicates the status of the machine to the external environment the controller has status input signals and zero from the datapath these signals indicate the contents of register holding the msb of the data word and the condition that the data word is respectively is the output of the flip flop zero is the output of circuit that checks the contents of register for all the circuit produces an output zero when is equal to e when is empty of preliminary asmd chart showing the state sequence and the register operations is illustrated in fig and the complete asmd chart in fig asserting start with the controller in idle transfers the state to concurrently loads register with the binary data word and fills the cells of with note that incrementing number with all in counter register produces number with all thus the first transition from to will clear subsequent transitions will have holding count of the bits of data that have been processed the content of as indicated by zero will also be examined in if is empty zero and the state returns to idle where it asserts ready in state is asserted to cause the datapath unit to increment at each clock pulse if is not empty of then zero indicating that there are some stored in the register the number in is shifted and its leftmost bit is transferred into this is done as many times as necessary until is transferred into for every detected in register is incremented and register is checked again for more the major loop is repeated until all the in are counted note that the state box of has no register operations but the block associated with it contains the decision box for note also that the serial input to shift register must be equal to because we dont want to shift external into the register in fig is shift register register is counter with parallel load the multiplexer input conditions for the control are determined from table the input conditions are obtained from the asmd chart for each

the transition from present state depends on start the transition from present state depends on zero and the transition from present state on present state goes to next state unconditionally the values under and in the table are determined from the boolean input conditions for the next state of and respectively the control implementation of the design example is shown in fig this is three level implementation with the multiplexers in the first level the inputs to the multiplexers are obtained from table the verilog description in hdl example instantiates structural models of the controller and the datapath the listing of code includes the lower level modules implementing their structures note that the datapath unit does not have reset signal to clear the registers but the models for the flip flop shift register and counter have an active low reset this illustrates the use of verilog data type to hardwire those ports to logic value in their instantiation within datapath str note also that the test bench uses hierarchical de referencing to access the state of the controller to make the debug and verification tasks easier without having to alter the module ports to provide access to the internal signals another detail to observe is that the serial input to the shift register is hardwired to the lower level models are described behaviorally for simplicity hdl

results in fig have been added for clarification in fig reset is toggled low at to drive the controller into idle but with start not yet having an assigned value the default is consequently the controller enters an unknown state the shaded waveform at the next clock and its outputs are when reset is asserted low again at the state enters idle then with start at the first clock after reset is

addressed in the problems at the end of the chapter race free design software race conditions once circuit has been synthesized either manually or with tools it is necessary to verify that the simulation results produced by the hdl behavioral model match those of the netlist of the gates standard cells of the physical circuit it is important to resolve any section race free design software race conditions is empty of machine returns to computations are idle done name clock reset start zero ff aa ready load regs shift left holds number of figure continued mismatch because the behavioral model was presumed to be correct there are various potential sources of mismatch between the results of simulation but we will consider one that typically happens in hdl based design methodology three realities contribute to the potential problem physical feedback path exists between datapath unit and control unit whose inputs include status signals fed back from the datapath unit blocked procedural assignments execute immediately and behavioral models simulate with propagation delays effectively creating immediate changes in the outputs of combinational logic when its inputs change e changes in the inputs and the outputs are scheduled in the same time step of the simulation and the order in which simulator executes multiple blocked assignments to the same variable at given time step of the simulation is indeterminate e unpredictable now consider sequential machine with an hdl model in which all assignments are made with the blocked assignment operator at clock pulse the register operations in the datapath the state transitions in the controller the updates of the next state and output logic of the controller and the updates to the status signals in the datapath are all scheduled to occur at the same time step of the simulation which executes first suppose that when clock pulse occurs the state of the controller changes before the register operations execute the change in the state could change the outputs of the control unit the new values of the outputs would be used by the datapath when it finally executes its assignments at that same clock pulse the result might not be the same as it would have been if the datapath had executed its assignments before the control unit updated its state and outputs conversely suppose that when the clock pulse occurs the datapath unit executes its operations and updates its status signals first the updated status signals could cause change in the value of the next state of the controller which would be used to update the state the result could differ from that which would result if the state had been updated before the edge sensitive operations in the datapath executed in either case the timing of register transfer operations and state transitions in the different representations of the system might not match failing to detect mismatch can have disastrous consequences for the user of the design finding the source of the mismatch can be very time consuming and costly it is better to avoid the mismatch by following strict discipline in your design fortunately there is solution to this dilemma designer can eliminate the software race conditions just described by observing the rule of modeling combinational logic with blocked assignments and modeling state transitions and edge sensitive register operations with nonblocking assignments software race cannot happen if nonblocking operators are used as shown in all of the examples in this text because the sampling mechanism of the nonblocking operator breaks the feedback path between state transition or edge sensitive datapath operation and the combinational logic that forms the next state or inputs to the registers in the datapath unit the mechanism does this because simulators evaluate the expressions on the right hand side of their nonblocking assignment statements before any blocked assignments are made thus the nonblocking assignments cannot be affected by the results of the blocked assignments this matches the hardware reality always use the blocking operator to model combinational logic and use the nonblocking operator to model edge sensitive register operations and state transitions it also might appear that the physical structure of datapath and the controller together create physical e hardware race condition because the status signals are fed back to the controller and the outputs of the controller are fed forward to the datapath however timing analysis can verify that change in the output of the controller will not propagate through the datapath logic and then through the input logic of the controller in time to have an effect on the output of the controller until the next clock pulse the state cannot update until the next edge of the clock even though the status signals update the value of the next state the flip flop cuts the feedback path section latch free design why waste silicon between clock cycles in practice timing analysis verifies that the circuit will operate at the specified clock frequency or it identifies signal paths whose propagation delays are problematic remember the design must implement the correct logic and operate at the speed prescribed by the clock latch free design why waste silicon continuous assignments model combinational logic implicitly feedback free continuous assignment will synthesize to combinational logic and the inputcoutput relationship of the logic is automatically sensitive to all of the inputs of the circuit in simulation the simulator monitors the right hand sides of all continuous assignments detects change in any of the referenced variables and updates the left hand side of an affected assignment statement unlike continuous assignment cyclic behavior is not necessarily completely sensitive to all of the variables that are referenced by its assignment statements if level sensitive cyclic behavior is used to describe combinational logic it is essential that the sensitivity list include every variable that is referenced on the right hand side of an assignment statement in the behavior if the list is incomplete the logic described by the behavior will be synthesized with latches at the outputs of the logic this implementation wastes silicon area and may have mismatch between the simulation of the behavioral model and the synthesized circuit these difficulties can be avoided by ensuring that the sensitivity list is complete but in large circuits it is easy to fail to include every referenced variable in the sensitivity list of level sensitive cyclic behavior consequently verilog included new operator to reduce the risk of accidentally synthesizing latches in verilog the tokens and can be combined as or and are used without sensitivity list to indicate that execution of the associated statement is sensitive to every variable that is referenced on the right hand side of an assignment statement in the logic in effect the operator indicates that the logic is to be interpreted hdl example the following level sensitive cyclic behavior will synthesize two channel multiplexer module output reg input input sel always sel endmodule the cyclic behavior has an implicit sensitivity list consisting of and sel and synthesized as level sensitive combinational logic the logic has an implicit sensitivity list composed of all of the variables that are referenced by the procedural assignments using the operator will prevent accidental synthesis of latches other language features the examples in this text have used only those features of the verilog hdl that are appropriate for an introductory course in logic design verilog contains features that are very useful to designers but which are not considered here among them are multidimensional arrays variable part selects array bit and part selects signed reg net and port declarations and local parameters these enhancements are treated in more advanced texts using verilog and verilog problems answers to problems marked with appear at the end of the book explain in words and write hdl statements for the operations specified by the following register transfer notation r if then else if then a logic circuit with active low synchronous reset has two control inputs and if is and is register is

modify the block diagram of the sequential multiplier given in fig and the asmd chart in fig to describe system that multiplies bit words but with bit bytewide external datapaths the machine is to

multiplier bytes least significant byte first and store the data in datapath registers got data is to be asserted for one cycle of the clock when the transfer is complete when run is asserted the product is to be formed sequentially done product is to be asserted for one clock cycle when the multiplication is complete when signal send data is asserted each byte of the product is to be placed on an bit output bus for one clock cycle in sequence beginning with the least significant byte the machine is to return to the initial state after the product has been transmitted consider safeguards such as not attempting to send or receive data while the product is being formed consider also other features that might eliminate needless multiplication by for example do not continue to multiply if

clock rate to datapath with lower clock rate converting data from parallel format to serial format in the process in the datapath shown entire words of data can be transferred into the pipeline at twice the rate at which the contents of the pipeline must be dumped into holding register or consumed by some processor the contents of the holding register can be shifted out serially to accomplish an overall parallel to serial conversion of the data stream the asmd chart indicates that the machine has synchronous reset to idle where it waits until rst is de asserted and en is asserted note that synchronous transitions which would occur from the other states to idle under the action of rst are not shown with en asserted the machine transitions from idle to accompanied by concurrent register

mounted on breadboards that are easily assembled in the laboratory the experiments are ordered according to the material presented in the book the last section consists of number of supplements with suggestions for using the verilog hdl to simulate and verify the functionality of the digital circuits presented in the experiments if an fpga prototyping board is available the experiments can be implemented in an fpga as an alternative to standard ics logic breadboard suitable for performing the experiments must have the following equipment light emitting diode led indicator lamps toggle switches to provide logic and logic signals pulsers with push buttons and debounce circuits to generate single pulses clock pulse generator with at least two frequencies low frequency of about pulse

wire strippers for cutting the wires digital logic trainers that include the required equipment are available from several manufacturers digital logic trainer contains led lamps toggle switches pulsers section introduction to experiments variable clock power supply and ic socket strips some experiments may require additional switches lamps or ic socket strips extended breadboards with more solderless sockets and plug in switches and lamps may be needed additional equipment required is dual trace oscilloscope for experiments and logic probe to be used for debugging and number of ics the ics required for the experiments are of the ttl or cmos series the integrated circuits to be used in the experiments can be classified as small scale integration ssi or medium scale integration msi circuits ssi circuits contain individual gates or flip flops and msi circuits perform specific digital functions the eight ssi gate ics needed for the experimentstwo input nand nor and or and xor gates inverters and three input and four input nand gatesare shown in fig the pin assignments for the gates are indicated in the diagram the pins are numbered from to pin number is marked vcc and pin

the two input nand gates are found inside the ic whose number is detailed descriptions of the msi circuits can be found in data books published by the manufacturers the best way to acquire experience with commercial msi circuit is to study its description in data book that provides complete information on the internal external and electrical characteristics of integrated circuits various semiconductor companies publish data books for the series the msi circuits that are needed for the experiments are introduced and explained when they are used for the first time the operation of the circuit is explained by referring to similar circuits in previous chapters the information given in this chapter about the msi circuits should be sufficient for performing the experiments adequately nevertheless reference to data book will always be preferable as it gives more detailed description of the circuits we will now demonstrate the method of presentation of msi circuits adopted here to illustrate we introduce the ripple counter ic type this ic is used in experiment and in subsequent experiments to generate sequence of binary numbers for verifying the operation of combinational circuits the information about the ic that is found in data book is shown in figs and part shows diagram of the internal logic circuit and its connection to external pins all inputs and outputs are given symbolic letters and assigned to pin numbers part shows the physical layout of the ic together with its pin assignment to signal names some of the pins are not used by the circuit and are marked as nc no connection the ic is inserted into socket and wires are connected to the various pins through the socket terminals when drawing schematic diagrams in this chapter we will show the ic in block diagram form as in fig the ic number here is written inside the block all input terminals are placed on the left of the block and all output terminals on the right the letter symbols of the signals such as and qa are written inside the block and the corresponding pin numbers such as and are written along the external lines vcc and gnd are the power terminals connected to pins and the size of the

clr internal circuit diagram schematic diagram figure ic type ripple counter and output terminals inputs or outputs may sometimes be placed on the top or the bottom of the block for convenience the operation of the circuit is similar to the ripple counter shown in fig with an asynchronous clear to each flip flop when input or or both are equal to logic ground all asynchronous clears are equal to and are disabled to clear all four flip flops to the output of the nand gate must be equal to this is accomplished by having both inputs and at logic about note that the and inputs show no connections it is characteristic of ttl circuits that an input terminal with no external connections has the effect of producing signal equivalent to logic note also that output qa is not connected to input internally the ic can operate as three bit counter using input and flip flops qb qc and qd it can operate as four bit counter using input if output qa is connected to input therefore to operate the circuit as four bit counter it is necessary to have an external connection between pin and pin the reset inputs and at pins and respectively must be grounded pins and must be connected to v power supply the input pulses must be applied to input at pin and the four flip flop outputs of the counter are taken from qa qb qc and qd at pins and respectively with qa being the least significant bit

hardware experiments requiring the use of digital integrated circuits section outlines hdl simulation experiments requiring verilog hdl compiler and simulator experiment binary and decimal numbers this experiment demonstrates the count sequence of binary numbers and the binary coded decimal bcd representation it serves as an introduction to the breadboard used in the laboratory and acquaints the student with the cathode ray oscilloscope reference material from the text that may be useful to know while performing the experiment can be found in section on binary numbers and section on bcd numbers binary count ic type consists of four flip flops as shown in fig they can be connected to count in binary or in bcd connect the ic to operate as four bit binary counter by wiring the external terminals as shown in fig is done by connecting wire from pin output qa to pin input input at pin is connected to pulser that provides single pulses the two reset inputs and are connected to ground the four outputs go to four indicator lamps with the low order bit of the counter from qa connected to the rightmost indicator lamp do not forget to supply and ground to the ic all connections should be made with the power supply in the off position turn the power on and observe the four indicator lamps the four bit number in the output is incremented by for every pulse generated in the push button pulser the count goes to binary and then back to disconnect the input of the counter at pin from the pulser and connect it to clock generator that produces train of pulses at low frequency of about pulse per second this will provide an automatic binary count note that the binary counter will be used in subsequent experiments to provide the input binary signals for testing combinational circuits push button pulser or vcc qa clock qb gnd qc qd indicator lamps figure binary counter oscilloscope display increase the frequency of the clock to khz or higher and connect its output to an oscilloscope observe the clock output on the oscilloscope and sketch its waveform using dual trace oscilloscope connect the output of qa to one channel and the output of the clock to the second channel note that the output of qa is complemented every time the clock pulse goes through negative transition from to note also that the clock frequency at the output of the first flip flop is one half that of the input clock frequency each flip flop in turn divides its incoming frequency by the four bit counter divides the incoming frequency by at output qd obtain timing diagram showing the relationship of the clock to the four outputs of the counter make sure that you include at least clock cycles the way to proceed with dual trace oscilloscope is as follows first observe the clock pulses and qa and record their timing waveforms then repeat by observing and recording the waveforms of qa together with qb followed by the waveforms of qb with qc and then qc with qd your final result should be diagram showing the relationship of the clock to the four outputs in one composite diagram having at least clock cycles bcd count the bcd representation uses the binary numbers from

four cells immediately clear to with the result that the output goes to the pulse after the count of changes the output to producing bcd count connect the ic to operate as bcd counter connect the input to pulser and the four outputs to indicator lamps verify that the count goes from to disconnect the input from the pulser and connect it to clock generator observe the clock waveform and the four outputs on the oscilloscope obtain an accurate timing diagram showing the relationship between the clock and the four outputs make sure to include at least clock cycles in the oscilloscope display and in the composite timing diagram output pattern when the count pulses into the bcd counter are continuous the counter keeps repeating the sequence from to and back to this means that each bit in the four outputs produces fixed pattern of and that is repeated every pulses these patterns can be predicted from list of the binary numbers from to the list will show that output qa being the least significant bit produces pattern of alternate and output qd being the most significant bit produces pattern of eight followed by two obtain the pattern for the other two outputs and then check all four patterns on the oscilloscope this is done with dual trace oscilloscope by displaying the clock pulses in one channel and one of the output waveforms in the other channel the pattern of and for the corresponding output is obtained by observing the output levels at the vertical positions where the pulses change from to other counts ic type can be connected to count from to variety of final counts this is done by connecting one or two outputs to the reset inputs and if is connected to qa instead of to qb in fig the resulting count will be from to which is less than qd and qa utilizing your knowledge of how and affect the final count connect the ic to count from to the following final counts connect each circuit and verify its count sequence by applying pulses from the pulser and observing the output count in the indicator lamps if the initial count starts with value greater than the final count keep applying input pulses until the output clears to experiment

verilog description to produce bit stream that can be downloaded to configure the internal resources g clbs of xilinx fpga and connectivity of the fpga three details require attention the pins of the prototyping board are connected to the pins of the fpga and the hardware implementation of the synthesized circuit requires that its input and output signals be associated with the pins of the prototyping board this association is made using the synthesis tool provided by the vendor of the fpga such tools are available free fpga prototyping boards have clock generator but it will be necessary in some cases to implement clock divider in verilog to obtain an internal clock whose frequency is suitable for the experiment and inputs to an fpga based circuit can be made using switches

standard graphic symbols rectangular shape symbols digital components such as gates decoders multiplexers and registers are available commercially in integrated circuits and are classified as ssi or msi circuits standard graphic symbols have been developed for these and other components so that the user can recognize each function from the unique graphic symbol assigned to it this standard known as ansi ieee std has been approved by industry government and professional organizations and is consistent with international standards the standard uses rectangular shape outline to represent each particular logic function within the outline there is general qualifying symbol denoting the logical operation performed by the unit for example the general qualifying symbol for multiplexer is mux the size of the outline is arbitrary and can be either square or rectangular shape with an arbitrary lengthcwidth ratio input lines are placed on the left and output lines are placed on the right if the direction of signal flow is reversed it must be indicated by arrows the rectangular shape graphic symbols for ssi gates are shown in fig the qualifying symbol for the and gate is the ampersand the or gate has the qualifying symbol that designates greater than or equal to indicating that at least one input must be active for the output to be active the symbol for the buffer gate is showing that only one input is present the exclusive or symbol designates the fact that only one input must be active for the output to be active the inclusion of the logic negation small circle in the output converts the gates to their complement values although the rectangular shape symbols for the gates are recommended the standard also recognizes the distinctive shape symbols for the gates shown in fig an example of an msi standard graphic symbol is the four bit parallel adder shown in fig the qualifying symbol for an adder is the greek letter the preferred section rectangular shape symbols and or buffer xor nand nor inverter xnor figure rectangular shape graphic symbols for gates q ci ci co co figure standard graphic symbol for four bit parallel adder ic type letters for the arithmetic operands are and the bit grouping symbols in the two types of inputs and the sum output are the decimal equivalents of the weights of the bits to the power of thus the input labeled corresponds to the value of the input carry is designated by ci and the output carry by co when the digital component represented by the outline is also commercial integrated circuit it is customary to write the ic pin number along each input and output thus ic type is four bit adder with look ahead carry it is enclosed in package with pins the pin numbers for the nine inputs and five outputs are shown in fig the other two pins are for the power supply before introducing the graphic symbols of other components it is necessary to review some terminology as mentioned in section positive logic system defines the more positive of two signal levels designated by as logic and the more negative signal level designated by as logic negative logic assumes the opposite assignment third alternative is to employ mixed logic convention where the signals are considered entirely in terms of their and values at any point in the circuit the user is allowed to define the logic polarity by assigning logic to either the or signal the mixed logic notation uses small right angle triangle graphic symbol to designate negative logic polarity at any input or output terminal see fig integrated circuit manufacturers specify the operation of integrated circuits in terms of and signals when an input or output is considered in terms of positive logic it is defined as active high when it is considered in terms of negative logic it is defined as active low active low inputs or outputs are recognized by the presence of the small triangle polarity indicator symbol when positive logic is used exclusively throughout the entire system the small triangle polarity symbol is equivalent to the small circle that designates negation in this book we have assumed positive logic throughout and employed the small circle when drawing logic diagrams when an input or output line does not include the small circle we define it to be active if it is logic an input or output that includes the small circle symbol is considered active if it is in the logic state however we will use the small triangle polarity symbol to indicate active low assignment in all drawings that represent standard diagrams this will conform with integrated circuit data books where the polarity symbol is usually employed note that the bottom four gates in fig could have been drawn with small triangle in the output lines instead of small circle another example of graphic symbol for an msi circuit is shown in fig this is to line decoder representing one half of ic type inputs are on the left and outputs on the right the identifying symbol y indicates that the circuit converts from code to code data inputs and are assigned binary weights and equivalent to and respectively the outputs are assigned numbers from to corresponding to outputs through respectively the decoder has one active low input and one active high input these two inputs go through an internal and y b en figure standard graphic symbol for to line decoder one half of ic type section qualifying symbols gate to enable the decoder the output of the and gate is labeled en enable and is activated when is at low level state and at high level state qualifying symbols the ieee standard graphic symbols for logic functions provide list of qualifying symbols to be used in conjunction with the outline qualifying symbol is added to the basic outline to designate the overall logic characteristics of the element or the physical characteristics of an input or output table lists some of the general qualifying symbols specified in the standard general qualifying symbol defines the basic function performed by the device represented in the diagram it is placed near the top center position of the rectangular shape outline the general qualifying symbols for the gates decoder and adder were shown in previous diagrams the other symbols are self explanatory and will be used later in diagrams representing the corresponding digital elements some of the qualifying symbols associated with inputs and outputs are shown in fig symbols associated with inputs are placed on the left side of the column labeled symbol symbols associated with outputs are placed on the right side of the column the active low input or output symbol is the polarity indicator as mentioned table general qualifying symbols symbol description and gate or function or gate or function

negation input or output dynamic indicator input three state output open collector output output with special amplification en enable input data input to storage element or flip flop inputs shift right shift left countup countdown ct contents of register equals binary figure qualifying symbols associated with inputs and outputs section dependency notation previously it is equivalent to the logic negation when positive logic is assumed the dynamic input is associated with the clock input in flip flop circuits it indicates that the input is active on transition from low to high level signal the three state output has third high impedance state which has no logic significance when the circuit is enabled the output is in the normal or logic state but when the circuit is disabled the three state output is in high impedance state this state is equivalent to an open circuit the open collector output has one state that exhibits high impedance condition an externally connected resistor is sometimes required in order to produce the proper logic level the diamond shape symbol may have bar on top for high type or on the bottom for low type the high or low type specifies the logic level when the output is not in the high impedance state for example ttl type integrated circuits have special outputs called open collector outputs these outputs are recognized by diamond shape symbol with bar under it this indicates that the output can be either in high impedance state or in low level state when used as part of distribution function two or more open collector nand gates when connected to common resistor perform positive logic and function or negative logic or function the output with special amplification is used in gates that provide special driving capabilities such gates are employed in components such as clock drivers or bus oriented transmitters the en symbol designates an enable input it has the effect of enabling all outputs when it is active when the input marked with en is inactive all outputs are disabled the symbols for flip flop inputs have the usual meaning the input is also associated with other storage elements such as memory input the symbols for shift right and shift left are arrows pointing to the right or the left respectively the symbols for count up and count down counters are the plus and minus symbols respectively an output designated by ct will be active when the contents of the register reach the binary count of when nonstandard information is shown inside the outline it is enclosed in square brackets like this dependency notation the most important aspect of the standard logic symbols is the dependency notation dependency notation is used to provide the means of denoting the relationship between different inputs or outputs without actually showing all the elements and interconnections between them we will first demonstrate the dependency notation with an example of the and dependency and then define all the other symbols associated with this notation the and dependency is represented with the letter followed by number any input or output in diagram that is labeled with the number associated with is considered to be anded with it for example if one input in the diagram has the label and another input is labeled with the number then the two inputs labeled and are considered to be anded together internally an example of and dependency is shown in fig in we have portion of graphic symbol with two and dependency labels and there are two inputs labeled with the number and one input labeled with the number the equivalent y a b c block with and equivalent interpretation figure example of and dependency interpretation is shown in part of the figure input associated with is considered to be anded with inputs and which are labeled with similarly input is anded with input to conform with the dependency between and the standard defines other dependencies each dependency is denoted by letter symbol except en the letter appears at the input or output and is followed by number each input or output affected by that dependency is labeled with that same number the dependencies and their corresponding letter designation are as follows denotes an and gate relationship denotes an or relationship denotes negate exclusive or relationship en specifies an enable action identifies control dependency specifies setting action specifies resetting action identifies mode dependency identifies an address dependency section symbols for combinational elements indicates an internal interconnection indicates controlled transmission the and dependencies are used to denote the boolean relationships of or and exclusive or similar to the that denotes the boolean and the en dependency is similar to the qualifying symbol en except that number follows it for example en only the outputs marked with that number are disabled when the input associated with en is active the control dependency is used to identify clock input in sequential element and to indicate which input is controlled by it the set and reset dependencies are used to specify internal logic states of an sr flip flop the and dependencies are explained in section in conjunction with the flip flop circuit the mode dependency is used to identify inputs that select the mode of operation of the unit the mode dependency is presented in section in conjunction with registers and counters the address dependency is used to identify the address input of memory it is introduced in section in conjunction with the memory unit the dependency is used to indicate interconnections inside the unit it signifies the existence of internal logic connections between inputs outputs internal inputs and internal outputs in any combination the dependency is used to indicate the controlled transmission path in cmos transmission gate symbols for combinational elements the examples in this section and the rest of this chapter illustrate the use of the standard in representing various digital components with graphic symbols the examples demonstrate actual commercial integrated circuits with the pin numbers included in the inputs and outputs most of the ics presented in this chapter are included with the suggested experiments outlined in chapter the graphic symbols for the adder and decoder were shown in section ic type can be connected as decoder as shown in fig the truth table of this decoder is shown in fig there are two and two inputs in the ic each pair must be connected together as shown in the diagram the enable input is active when in the low level state the outputs are all active low the inputs are assigned binary weights and equivalent to and respectively the outputs are assigned numbers from to the sum of the weights of the inputs determines the output that is active thus if the two input lines with weights and are activated the total weight is and output is activated of course the en input must be activated for any output to be active the decoder is special case of more general component referred to as coder coder is device that receives an input binary code on number of inputs and produces different binary code on number of outputs instead of using the qualifying symbol y the coder can be specified by the code name for example the to line decoder of fig can be symbolized with the name bin oct since the circuit converts bit binary number into octal values through y b g en figure ic type connected as decoder before showing the graphic symbol for the multiplexer it is necessary to show variation of the and dependency the and dependency is sometimes represented by shorthand notation like this symbol stands for eight and dependency symbols from to as follows at any given time only one out of the eight and gates can be active the active and gate is determined from the inputs associated with the symbol these inputs are marked with weights equal to the powers of for the eight and gates just listed the weights are and corresponding to the numbers and respectively the and gate that is active at any given time is determined from the sum of the weights of the active inputs thus if inputs and are active then the and gate that is active has the number this makes active and the other seven and gates inactive the standard graphic symbol for multiplexer is shown in fig the qualifying symbol mux identifies the device as multiplexer the symbols inside the block are part of the standard notation but the symbols marked outside are user defined symbols the function table of the ic can be found in fig the and dependency is marked with and is associated with the inputs enclosed in brackets these inputs have weights of and they are actually what we have called the selection inputs the eight data inputs are marked with numbers from to the net weight of the active inputs associated with the symbol specifies the number in the data input that is active for example if selection inputs cba then inputs and associated with are active this gives numerical value for the and dependency of which makes active since is anded with data input number it makes this input active thus the output will be equal to data input provided that the enable input is active section symbols for flip flops strobe en mux select en b mux y ic type mux ic type quadruple mux figure graphic symbols for multiplexers figure represents the quadruple multiplexer ic type whose function table is listed in fig the enable and selection inputs are common to all four multiplexers this is indicated in the standard notation by the indented box at the top of the diagram which represents common control block the inputs to common control block control all lower sections of the diagram the common enable input en is active when in the low level state the and dependency determines which input is active in each multiplexer section when the inputs marked with are active when the inputs marked with are active the active inputs are applied to the corresponding outputs if en is active note that the input symbols and are marked in the upper section only instead of repeating them in each section symbols for flip flops the standard graphic symbols for different types of flip flops are shown in fig flip flop is represented by rectangular shaped block with inputs on the left and outputs on the right one output designates the normal state of the flip flop and the latch positive edge triggered flip flop negative edge triggered positive edge triggered jk flip flop jk flip flop master slave flip flop master slave jk flip flop figure standard graphic symbols for flip flops other output with small circle negation symbol or polarity indicator designates the complement output the graphic symbols distinguish between three types of flip flops the latch whose internal construction is shown in fig the mastercslave flip flop shown in fig and the edge triggered flip flop introduced in fig the graphic symbol for the latch or flip flop has inputs and indicated inside the block the graphic symbol for the jk flip flop has inputs and inside the notation and are examples of control dependency the input in controls input in d flip flop and inputs and in jk flip flop the latch has no other symbols besides the and inputs the edge triggered flip flop has an arrowhead shaped symbol in front of the control dependency to designate dynamic input the dynamic indicator symbol denotes that the flip flop responds to the positive edge transition of the input clock pulses small circle outside the block along the dynamic indicator designates negative edge transition for triggering the flip flop the mastercslave is considered to be pulse triggered flip flop and is section symbols for registers s r one half jk flip flop one half flip flop figure ic flip flops with direct set and reset indicated as such with an upside down symbol in front of the outputs this is to show that the output signal changes on the falling edge of the pulse note that the masterc slave flip flop is drawn without the dynamic indicator flip flops available in integrated circuit packages provide special inputs for setting and resetting the flip flop asynchronously these inputs are usually called direct set and direct reset they affect the output on the negative level of the signal without the need of clock the graphic symbol of mastercslave jk flip flop with direct set and reset is shown in fig the notations and represent control dependency showing that the clock input at controls inputs and and have no in front of the letters and therefore they are not controlled by the clock at the and inputs have small circle along the input lines to indicate that they are active when in the logic level the function table for the flip flop is shown in fig the graphic symbol for positive edge triggered flip flop with direct set and reset is shown in fig the positive edge transition of the clock at input controls input the and inputs are independent of the clock this is ic type whose function table is listed in fig symbols for registers the standard graphic symbol for register is equivalent to the symbol used for group of flip flops with common clock input fig shows the standard graphic symbol of ic type consisting of four flip flops with common clock and clear inputs the clock input and the clear input appear in the common control block the inputs to the common control block are connected to each of the elements in the lower sections of the diagram the notation is the control dependency that controls all the inputs thus each flip flop is triggered by the common clock input the dynamic input symbol associated with indicates that the flip flops are triggered on the positive edge of the input clock the common input resets all flip flops when its input is at low level state the symbol is placed only once in the upper section instead of clear clock q figure graphic symbol for ic type quad flip flop repeating it in each section the complement outputs of the flip flops in this diagram are marked with the polarity symbol rather than the negation symbol the standard graphic symbol for shift register with parallel load is shown in fig this is ic type whose function table can be found in fig the qualifying symbol for shift register is srg followed by number that designates the number of stages thus denotes four bit shift register the common control block has two mode dependencies and for the shift and load operations respectively note that the ic has single input labeled sh ld shift load which is split into two lines to show the two modes is active when the sh ld input is high and is active when the sh ld input is low is recognized as active low from the polarity indicator along its input line note the convention in this symbology we must recognize that single input actually exists in pin but it is split into two parts in order to assign to it the two modes and the control dependency is for the clock input the dynamic symbol along the input indicates that the flip flops trigger on the positive edge of the clock the symbol following indicates that the register shifts to the right or in the downward direction when mode is active the four sections below the common control block represent the four flip flops flip flop qa has three inputs two are associated with the serial shift operation and one section symbols for registers clear sh ld shift load clock qa qb qc qd qd figure graphic symbol for shift register with parallel load ic type with the parallel load operation the serial input label indicates that the input of flip flop qa is active when shift is active and goes through positive clock transition the other serial input with label has polarity symbol in its input line corresponding to the complement of input in jk flip flop the third input of qa and the inputs of the other flip flops are for the parallel input data each input is denoted by the label the is for load and is for the clock if the input in pin number is in the low level is active and positive transition of the clock at causes parallel transfer from the four inputs through into the four flip flops qa through qd note that the parallel input is labeled only in the first and second sections it is assumed to be in the other two sections below figure shows the graphic symbol for the bidirectional shift register with parallel load ic type the function table for this ic is listed in fig the common control block shows an input for resetting all flip flops to asynchronously the mode select has two inputs and the mode dependency may take binary values from to this is indicated by the symbol which stands for and is similar to the notation for the dependency in multiplexers the symbol associated with the clock is d is the control dependency for the clock the symbol indicates that the register shifts right down in this case when the mode is the symbol clear m clock serial input qa c qb serial input qc qd figure graphic symbol for bidirectional shift register with parallel load ic type indicates that the register shifts left up in this case when the mode is the right and left directions are obtained when the page is turned degrees counterclockwise the sections below the common control block represent the four flip flops the first flip flop has serial input for shift right denoted by mode clock input the last flip flop has serial input for shift left denoted by mode clock input all four flip flops have parallel input denoted by the label mode clock input thus is for parallel load the remaining mode has no effect on the outputs because it is not included in the input labels symbols for counters the standard graphic symbol of binary ripple counter is shown in fig the qualifying symbol for ripple counter is rctr the designation stands for the divide by circuit that is obtained from the single flip flop qa the designation is for the divide by counter obtained from the other three flip flops the diagram represents ic type whose internal circuit diagram is shown in fig the common control block has an internal and gate with inputs and when both of these inputs are equal to the content of the counter goes to zero this is indicated by section symbols for counters rctr ct qa qb ct qc qd figure graphic symbol for ripple counter ic type the symbol ct since the count input does not go to the clock inputs of all flip flops it has no label and instead the symbol is used to indicate count up operation the dynamic symbol next to the together with the polarity symbol along the input line signify that the count is affected with negative edge transition of the input signal the bit grouping from to in the output represents values for the weights to the power of thus represents the value of and represents the value the standard graphic symbol for the four bit counter with parallel load ic type is shown in fig the qualifying symbol for synchronous counter is ctr followed by the symbol divide by which gives the cycle length of the counter there is single load input at pin that is split into the two modes and is active when the load input at pin is low and is active when the load input at pin is high is recognized as active low from the polarity indicator along its input line the count enable inputs use the dependencies is associated with the input and with the input of the count enable the label associated with the clock is this means that the circuit counts up the symbol when and are active load ent and enp and the clock in goes through positive transition this condition is specified in the function table of the listed in fig the parallel inputs have the label meaning that the inputs are active when is active load and the clock goes through positive transition the output carry is designated by the label this is interpreted to mean that the output carry is active equal to if is active ent and the content ct of the counter is binary note that the outputs ctr clear ct load output carry ent enp clock qa c qb qc qd figure graphic symbol for bit binary counter with parallel load ic type have an inverted symbol indicating that all the flip flops are of the mastercslave type the polarity symbol in the input designates an inverted pulse for the input clock this means that the master is triggered on the negative transition of the clock pulse and the slave changes state on the positive transition thus the output changes on the positive transition of the clock pulse it should be noted that ic type low power schottky version has positive edge triggered flip flops symbol for ram the standard graphic symbol for the random access memory ram is shown in fig the numbers that follow the qualifying symbol ram designate the number of words and the number of bits per word the common control block is shown with four address lines and two control inputs each bit of the word is shown in separate section with an input and output data line the address dependency is used to identify the address inputs of the memory data inputs and outputs affected by the address are labeled with the letter the bit grouping from through provides the binary address that ranges from through the inverted triangle signifies three state outputs the polarity symbol specifies the inversion of the outputs the operation of the memory is specified by means of the dependency notation the ram graphic symbol uses four dependencies address and en enable and control input is to be considered anded with and because has after the letter and the other two have in their label the en dependency is used problems ram cs we read write figure graphic symbol for ram ic type to identify an enable input that controls the data outputs the dependency controls the inputs as indicated by the label thus for write operation we have the and dependency cs the and dependency we and the dependency which specifies

easily into the crystalline structure of the silicon dopants are differentiated on the basis of whether they have either three valence electrons or five valence electrons silicon crystalline structure is such that each silicon atom shares its four valence electrons with its four nearest neighbors thereby completing its valence structure the atoms of dopant with five valence electrons referred to as n type dopant fit in the physical structure of the crystal but their fifth electrons are held only loosely by their parent atoms in the bonded structure consequently an applied electric field can cause such electrons to flow as current on the other hand dopant atom with only three valence electrons p type dopant has vacant valence site under the influence of an applied electric field an electron from neighboring silicon atom in the bonded structure can jump from its host and fill vacant dopant site leaving behind vacancy at its host this migration visualized as leapfrogging of electrons from hole to hole establishes current current is due to the movement of electrons which are negative charge carriers current is measured however in the opposite direction of flow by conventionsince the days of benjamin franklin think of current as being the motion of an equivalent positive charge moving in the opposite direction of an electron whose charge is negative holes move in the direction of current although the underlying physical movement of electrons is in the opposite direction thermal agitation causes both types of charge carriers to be present in semiconductor if the majority carrier is hole the device is said to be p type device if the majority carrier is an electron the device is said to be an type device bipolar transistors rely on both types of carriers metal oxide silicon semiconductors rely on majority carrier either an electron or hole but not both the type and relative amount of dopant determine the type of semiconductor material appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits gate gate drain source drain source p n type substrate type substrate channel channel figure basic structure of mos transistor the basic structure of metal oxide semiconductor mos transistor is shown in fig the channel mos transistor consists of lightly doped substrate of type silicon material two regions are heavily doped with type impurities by diffusion process to form the source and drain the source terminal supplies charge carriers to an external circuit the drain terminal removes charge carriers from the circuit the region between the two type sections serves as the channel in its simplest form the gate is metal plate separated from the channel by an insulted dielectric of silicon dioxide negative voltage with respect to the substrate at the gate terminal causes an induced electric field in the channel that attracts type carriers holes from the substrate as the magnitude of the negative voltage increases the region below the gate accumulates more positive carriers the conductivity increases and current can flow from source to drain provided that voltage difference is maintained between these two terminals there are four basic types of mos structures the channel can be or type depending on whether the majority carriers are holes or electrons the mode of operation can be enhancement or depletion depending on the state of the channel region at zero gate voltage if the channel is initially doped lightly with type impurity in which case it is called diffused channel conducting channel exists at zero gate voltage and the device is said to operate in the depletion mode in this mode current flows unless the channel is depleted by an applied gate field if the region beneath the gate is left initially uncharged channel must be induced by the gate field before current can flow thus the channel current is enhanced by the gate voltage and such device is said to operate in the enhancement mode the source is the terminal through which the majority carriers enter the device if the majority carrier is hole type channel the source terminal supplies current to the circuit if the majority carrier is an electron type channel the source removes current from the circuit the drain is the terminal through which the majority carriers leave the device in p channel mos the source terminal is connected to the substrate and negative voltage is applied to the drain terminal when the gate voltage is above threshold voltage vt about no current flows in the channel and the drain to source path is like an open circuit when the gate voltage is sufficiently negative below vt channel is formed and type carriers flow from source to drain type carriers are positive and correspond to positive current flow from source to drain appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits drain drain gate substrate gate substrate source source channel channel figure symbols for mos transistors in the channel mos the source terminal is connected to the substrate and positive voltage is applied to the drain terminal when the gate voltage is below the threshold voltage vt about no current flows in the channel when the gate voltage is sufficiently positive above vt to form the channel type carriers flow from source to drain type carriers are negative and correspond to positive current flow from drain to source the threshold voltage may vary from to depending on the particular process used the graphic symbols for the mos transistors are shown in fig the symbol for the enhancement type is the one with the broken line connection between source and drain in this symbol the substrate can be identified and is shown connected to the source an alternative symbol omits the substrate and instead an arrow is placed in the source terminal to show the direction of positive current flow from source to drain in the channel mos and from drain to source in the channel mos because of the symmetrical construction of source and drain the mos transistor can be operated as bilateral device although normally operated so that carriers flow from source to drain there are circumstances when it is convenient to allow carriers to flow from drain to source one advantage of the mos device is that it can be used not only as transistor but as resistor as well resistor is obtained from the mos by permanently biasing the gate terminal for conduction the ratio of the sourcecdrain voltage to the channel current then determines the value of the resistance different resistor values may be constructed during manufacturing by fixing the channel length and width of the mos device three logic circuits using mos devices are shown in fig for an channel mos the supply voltage vdd is positive about to allow positive current flow from drain to source the two voltage levels are function of the threshold voltage vt the low level is anywhere from zero to vt and the high level ranges from vt to vdd the channel gates usually employ positive logic the channel mos circuits use negative voltage for vdd to allow positive current flow from source to drain the two voltage levels are both negative above and below the negative threshold voltage vt channel gates usually employ negative logic the inverter circuit shown in fig uses two mos devices acts as the load resistor and as the active device the load resistor mos has its gate connected to vdd appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits vdd vdd vdd a ab y b a b inverter nand gate nor gate figure channel mos logic circuits thus maintaining it in the conduction state when the input voltage is low below vt turns off since is always on the output voltage is about vdd when the input voltage is high abovevt turns on current flows from vdd through the load resistor and into the geometry of the two mos devices must be such that the resistance of when conducting is much less than the resistance of to maintain the output at voltage below vt the nand gate shown in fig uses transistors in series inputs and must both be high for all transistors to conduct and cause the output to go low if either input is low the corresponding transistor is turned off and the output is high again the series resistance formed by the two active mos devices must be much less than the resistance of the load resistor mos the nor gate shown in uses transistors in parallel if either input is high the corresponding transistor conducts and the output is low if all inputs are low all active transistors are off and the output is high complementary mos complementary mos cmos circuits take advantage of the fact that both channel and channel devices can be fabricated on the same substrate cmos circuits consist of both types of mos devices interconnected to form logic functions the basic circuit is the inverter which consists of one channel transistor and one channel transistor as shown in fig the source terminal of the channel device is at vdd and the source terminal of the channel device is at ground the value of vdd section complementary mos vdd vdd y ab nand gate vdd y n inverter b b nor gate figure cmos logic circuits appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits may be anywhere from to the two voltage levels are for the low level and vdd for the high level typically to understand the operation of the inverter we must review the behavior of the mos transistor from the previous section the channel mos conducts when its gate to source voltage is positive the channel mos conducts when its gate to source voltage is negative either type of device is turned off if its gate to source voltage is zero now consider the operation of the inverter when the input is low both gates are at zero potential the input is at vdd relative to the source of the channel device and at relative to the source of the channel device the result is that the channel device is turned on and the channel device is turned off under these conditions there is low impedance path from vdd to the output and very high impedance path from output to ground therefore the output voltage approaches the high level vdd under normal loading conditions when the input is high both gates are at vdd and the situation is reversed the channel device is off and the channel device is on the result is that the output approaches the low level of two other cmos basic gates are shown in two input nand gate consists of two type units in parallel and two type units in series as shown in fig if all inputs are high both channel transistors turn off and both channel transistors turn on the output has low impedance to ground and produces low state if any input is low the associated channel transistor is turned off and the associated channel transistor is turned on the output is coupled to vdd and goes to the high state multiple input nand gates may be formed by placing equal numbers of type and type transistors in parallel and series respectively in an arrangement similar to that shown in fig two input nor gate consists of two type units in parallel and two type units in series as shown in fig when all inputs are low both channel units are on and both channel units are off the output is coupled to vdd and goes to the high state if any input is high the associated channel transistor is turned off and the associated channel transistor turns on connecting the output to ground and causing low level output mos transistors can be considered to be electronic switches that either conduct or are open as an example the cmos inverter can be visualized as consisting of two switches as shown in fig applying low voltage to the input causes the upper switch to close supplying high voltage to the output applying high voltage to the input causes the lower switch to close connecting the output to ground thus the output vout is the complement of the input vin commercial applications often use other graphic symbols for mos transistors to emphasize the logical behavior of the switches the arrows showing the direction of current flow are omitted instead the gate input of the channel transistor is drawn with an inversion bubble on the gate terminal to show that it is enabled with low voltage the inverter circuit is redrawn with these symbols in fig logic in the input causes the upper transistor to conduct making the output logic logic in the input enables the lower transistor making the output logic vdd section complementary mos vdd vin vout y switch model logical model figure cmos inverter cmos characteristics when cmos logic circuit is in static state its power dissipation is very low this is because at least one transistor is always off in the path between the power supply and ground when the state of the circuit is not changing as result typical cmos gate has static power dissipation on the order of mw however when the circuit is changing state at the rate of mhz the power dissipation increases to about mw and at mhz it is about mw cmos logic is usually specified for single power supply operation over voltage range from to with typical vdd value of operating cmos at larger power supply voltage reduces the propagation delay time and improves the noise margin but the power dissipation is increased the propagation delay time with vdd ranges from to ns depending on the type of cmos used the noise margin is usually about of the power supply voltage the fan out of cmos gates is about when they are operated at frequency of mhz the fan out decreases with an increase in the frequency of operation of the gates there are several series of the cmos digital logic family the series are pin and function compatible with ttl devices having the same number for example cmos ic type has six inverters with the same pin configuration as ttl type the high speed cmos series is an improvement over the series with tenfold increase in switching speed the series is electrically compatible with ttl ics this means that circuits in this series can be connected to inputs and outputs of ttl ics without the need of additional interfacing circuits newer versions of cmos are the high speed series and its ttl compatible version the cmos fabrication process is simpler than that of ttl and provides greater packing density thus more circuits can be placed on given area of silicon at reduced cost per function this property together with the low power dissipation of cmos circuits good noise immunity and reasonable propagation delay makes cmos the most popular standard as digital logic family appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits cmos transmission gate circuits special cmos circuit that is not available in the other digital logic families is the transmission gate the transmission gate is essentially an electronic switch that is controlled by an input logic level it is used to simplify the construction of various digital components when fabricated with cmos technology figure shows the basic circuit of the transmission gate whereas cmos inverter consists of p channel transistor connected in series with an channel transistor transmission gate is formed by one channel and one channel mos transistor connected in parallel the channel substrate is connected to ground and the channel substrate is connected to vdd when the gate is at vdd and the gate is at ground both transistors conduct and there is closed path between input and output when the gate is at ground and the gate is at vdd both transistors are off and there is an open circuit between and figure shows the block diagram of the transmission gate note that the terminal of the channel gate is marked with the negation symbol figure demonstrates the behavior of the switch in terms of positive logic assignment with vdd equivalent to logic and ground equivalent to logic the transmission gate is usually connected to an inverter as shown in fig this type of arrangement is referred to as bilateral switch the control input is connected directly to the channel gate and its inverse to the channel gate when the n y tg vdd p closed switch open switch y y figure transmission gate tg section cmos transmission gate circuits x tg figure bilateral switch switch is closed producing path between and when the switch is open disconnecting the path between and various circuits can be constructed that use the transmission gate to demonstrate its usefulness as component in the cmos family we will show three examples the exclusive or gate can be constructed with two transmission gates and two inverters as shown in fig input controls the paths in the transmission gates and input is connected to output through the gates when input is equal to transmission gate is closed and output is equal to input when input is equal to is closed and output is equal to the complement of input this results in the exclusive or truth table as indicated in fig another circuit that can be constructed with transmission gates is the multiplexer four to one line multiplexer implemented with transmission gates is shown in fig the tg circuit provides transmission path between its horizontal input and b b close open close open open close open close figure exclusive or constructed with transmission gates appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits tg tg tg tg tg figure multiplexer with transmission gates output lines when the two vertical control inputs have the value of in the uncircled terminal and in the circled terminal with an opposite polarity in the control inputs the path disconnects and the circuit behaves like an open switch the two selection inputs control the transmission path in the tg circuits inside each box is marked the condition for the transmission gate switch to be closed thus if and there is closed path from input to output through the two tgs marked with and the other three inputs are disconnected from the output by one of the other tg circuits section switch level modeling with hdl d tg tg figure gated latch with transmission gates the level sensitive flip flop commonly referred to as the gated latch can be constructed with transmission gates as shown in fig the input controls two transmission gates tg when the tg connected to input has closed path and the one connected to output has an open path this configuration produces an equivalent circuit from input through two inverters to output thus the output follows the data input as long as remains active when switches to the first tg disconnects input from the circuit and the second tg produces closed path between the two inverters at the output thus the value that was present at input at the time that went from to is retained at the output mastercslave flip flop can be constructed with two circuits of the type shown in fig the first circuit is the master and the second is the slave thus mastercslave flip flop can be constructed with four transmission gates and six inverters switch level modeling with hdl cmos is the dominant digital logic family used with integrated circuits by definition cmos is complementary connection of an nmos and pmos transistor mos transistors can be considered to be electronic switches that either conduct or are open by specifying the connections among mos switches the designer can describe digital circuit constructed with cmos this type of description is called switch level modeling in verilog hdl the two types of mos switches are specified in verilog hdl with the keywords nmos and pmos they are instantiated by specifying the three terminals of the transistor as shown in fig nmos drain source gate pmos drain source gate switches are considered to be primitives so the use of an instance name is optional appendix semiconductors and cmos integrated circuits the connections to power source vdd and to ground must be specified when mos circuits are designed power and ground are defined with the keywords and they are specified for example with the following statements pwr grd sources of type are equivalent to vdd and have value of logic sources of type are equivalent to ground connection and have value of logic the description of the cmos inverter of fig
